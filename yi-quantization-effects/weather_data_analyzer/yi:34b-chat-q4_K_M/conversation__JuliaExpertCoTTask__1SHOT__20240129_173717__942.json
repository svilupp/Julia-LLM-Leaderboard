Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Check for increasing/decreasing/stable trend\n    n = length(temps) - 1\n    if n > 0 && (mean_temp == temps[end] || mean_temp == temps[1])\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif mean_temp > temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Output will be a named tuple with the calculated statistics\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":7.482163748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
