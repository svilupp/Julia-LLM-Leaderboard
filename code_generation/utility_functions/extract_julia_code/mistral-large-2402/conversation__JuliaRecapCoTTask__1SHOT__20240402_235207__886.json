[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on your task description, here's a systematic approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**\n   - String manipulation functions like `split`, `startswith`, and `join` will be useful.\n   - Regular expressions can be used to identify code blocks. Julia's `Regex` and `match` functions will be helpful.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**\n   - We'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown string `md` as input.\n   - Inside the function, we'll use a regular expression to identify Julia code blocks. The regex pattern will look for strings that start and end with triple backticks (`` ` ``), with the language specified as \"julia\".\n   - We'll then remove the code fences (triple backticks and language specification) from each matched code block.\n   - Finally, we'll join the cleaned code blocks together with a newline character.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n   - After writing the function, we'll need to test it with various inputs to ensure it works correctly. This step is essential to catch any edge cases that might have been missed during the initial problem-solving phase.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the regex pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and remove the code fences\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline character\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work as per your requirements. However, please note that this function does not handle nested code blocks or code blocks with syntax errors. If you need to handle such cases, you might need a more complex parsing strategy, possibly involving a full markdown parser.\n\nAs for the **Special Instructions**, you didn't provide any specific ones, so I followed the general guidelines for writing Julia code. If you have any specific instructions or requirements, please let me know, and I'll adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[393,592],"elapsed":16.45086675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1183273920,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
