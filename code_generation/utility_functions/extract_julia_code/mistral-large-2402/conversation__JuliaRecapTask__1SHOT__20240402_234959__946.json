[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and comprehension in Julia.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: We'll create a function that accepts a markdown document as a string. The function will use a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: After writing the function, we'll need to ensure it works correctly by testing it with various inputs.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Define a regular expression pattern for Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join(replace.(code_blocks, pattern => s\"\\1\"), \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, and the `replace` function to replace the matched pattern with the content inside the code block (excluding the code fences). The `.` operator is used to apply the `replace` function to each matched pattern. The `join` function is then used to combine the extracted code blocks into a single string, with a newline separating each block.","status":200,"tokens":[391,431],"elapsed":10.847079291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-602065379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
