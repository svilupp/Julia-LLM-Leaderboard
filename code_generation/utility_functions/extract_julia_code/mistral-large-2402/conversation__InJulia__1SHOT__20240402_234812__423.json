It then filters out the code blocks that are not Julia language code blocks. After that, it removes the code fences and extra spaces from the code blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[84,206],"elapsed":4.818454917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":223234560,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
