[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your problem description and the special instructions, here's how I would approach this task using Julia.\n\nFirstly, I would recall that Julia has a built-in package called `Markdown` for parsing markdown documents. I would use this package to parse the given markdown document `md`.\n\nSecondly, I would write a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown string as an argument. This function would parse the markdown string using the `Markdown` package, iterate over the parsed content, and extract all the code blocks that are written in Julia.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for (i, block) in enumerate(Markdown.parse(md))\n        if typeof(block) <: Markdown.CodeBlock\n            language = lowercase(Markdown.codeinfo(block).lang)\n            if language == \"julia\" || language == \"jl\"\n                code = Markdown.content(block)\n                push!(code_blocks, code)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n- It first initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted Julia code blocks.\n- It then parses the given markdown string `md` using the `Markdown.parse` function.\n- It iterates over the parsed content using a for loop. For each block in the parsed content, it checks if the block is a code block (i.e., an instance of `Markdown.CodeBlock`). If the block is a code block, it checks if the language of the code block is Julia (i.e., \"julia\" or \"jl\"). If the language is Julia, it extracts the code from the code block and adds it to the `code_blocks` array.\n- Finally, it joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array together with a newline and returns the joined string.\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, I would test the function with some sample markdown documents that contain Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[393,516],"elapsed":13.869215458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-354981131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
