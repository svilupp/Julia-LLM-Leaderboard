[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use Julia's string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and perhaps some control structures.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: We can create a function that takes a markdown document as a string, uses regular expressions to find code blocks, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: After writing the function, we should test it with some sample inputs to make sure it's working as expected.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the pattern for Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join(replace.(match.(r\"```julia\\n(.*)```\"ms, code_blocks), r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\"), \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a pattern for Julia code blocks in a markdown document. It then uses the `matchall` function to find all code blocks that match this pattern. For each code block, it removes the code fences using the `replace` function and joins the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[393,437],"elapsed":11.159541167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1794544060,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
