[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function in Julia that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\\n\")[2:end]\n    code_blocks = [split(block, \"```\")[1] for block in code_blocks]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown string on the Julia code fence, then taking everything after the first split (which is the actual code). It then splits each of these blocks on the closing code fence and takes the first part (the code itself). Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[219,172],"elapsed":4.434360583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1899215509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
