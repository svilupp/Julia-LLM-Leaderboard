[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and perhaps some functions for handling collections.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: Here's a function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    julia_code = join(replace.(code_blocks, r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\"), \"\\n\")\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- The `matchall` function is used with a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` matches strings that start with ```julia, followed by any character (including newlines, thanks to the `m` and `s` modifiers), and ending with ```. The `(.*?)` part is a non-greedy capture group that captures the code inside the fences.\n- The `replace` function is used with another regular expression to remove the code fences from each code block.\n- The `join` function is used to join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: I would normally test the function with some example inputs to make sure it's working correctly. However, as per your instructions, I haven't provided any examples. Please feel free to test it on your own with some sample markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[391,425],"elapsed":11.944182959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1396870818,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
