It then filters out the code blocks that are not Julia code blocks. After that, it extracts the code from these blocks and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[84,226],"elapsed":6.214577709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-957958745,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
