X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**\n   - String manipulation functions like `split`, `startswith`, and `join` will be useful.\n   - Regular expressions can be used to identify code blocks.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**\n   - We can split the markdown document into lines using the `split` function.\n   - Then, we can iterate over the lines and identify Julia code blocks. A code block starts with a line that begins with ``` `julia`` and ends with a line that begins with ``` ` ``. We can use the `startswith` function to check this.\n   - Once we've identified a code block, we can remove the code fences (``` `julia`` and ``` ` ``) and add the code to our result.\n   - Finally, we can join the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n   - We should check that our function correctly identifies code blocks, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together.\n   - We should also check that our function handles edge cases correctly, such as a document with no code blocks or a document with a code block at the beginning or end.\n\nHere's the Julia code for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            current_block *= \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif !isempty(current_block)\n            push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function should correctly extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document and join them together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[391,592],"elapsed":14.95441575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1167125140,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
