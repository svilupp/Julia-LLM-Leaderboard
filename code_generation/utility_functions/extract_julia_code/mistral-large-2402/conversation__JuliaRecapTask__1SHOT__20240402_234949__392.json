X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We can use these to identify and extract code blocks from the markdown document. The regex for a Julia code block in markdown is ` ```julia\\n(.*?)\\n``` ` (s flag for dotall mode).\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: We can define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a string `md` as input. Inside the function, we can use the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string. Then, we can extract the captured groups (i.e., the code blocks) and join them together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: We can test the function with a sample markdown string containing Julia code blocks to ensure that it correctly extracts and joins the code blocks.\n\nHere's the Julia code for the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input, finds all Julia code blocks in it, extracts the code, and returns it as a single string with code blocks separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[391,373],"elapsed":8.934574083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2093019884,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
