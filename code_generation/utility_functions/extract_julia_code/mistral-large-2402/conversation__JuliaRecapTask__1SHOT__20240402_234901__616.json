[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and perhaps some functions to handle collections.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: Here's a function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    codes = join.(match.(r\"(?s).*\", code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- `matchall` with the regex `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` is used to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `s` modifier makes `.` match newlines, and the `m` modifier makes `^` and `$` match the start and end of each line, respectively.\n- `join.(match.(r\"(?s).*\", code_blocks), \"\\n\")` is used to remove the code fences. `match.(r\"(?s).*\", code_blocks)` returns a vector of matches, each of which is a single line of code. `join.(..., \"\\n\")` then joins these lines together with newlines.\n- `join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")` is used to join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: I would typically test the function with some sample inputs to make sure it's working as expected. However, as per your instructions, I won't provide any examples here.","status":200,"tokens":[391,442],"elapsed":11.919501333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1883374591,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
