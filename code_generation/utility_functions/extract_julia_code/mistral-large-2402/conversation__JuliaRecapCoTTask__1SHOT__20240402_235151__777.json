[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's how I would approach it:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**\n   - String manipulation functions like `split`, `startswith`, and `join`\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching\n   - Multi-line string literals using triple quotes `\"\"\"`\n\n2. **Solve the Task**\nHere's a function that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the pattern for a Julia code block\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = join(m.captures[1] for m in matches, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches a string that starts with `` `julia`, followed by any number of characters (including newlines), and ends with `` ` ``. The `s` at the end of the pattern is a modifier that makes the `.` character match newlines.\n\nThe `matchall` function finds all matches of the pattern in the input string. For each match, we extract the captured code block (excluding the code fences) and join them together with a newline.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\nI would test this function with various markdown documents containing Julia code blocks to make sure it's working correctly. I would also check that it handles edge cases correctly, such as code blocks with no code inside, code blocks with only a single line of code, and code blocks with indented code fences.\n\nAs there are no special instructions provided, I have followed the general guidelines for Julia programming.","status":200,"tokens":[393,481],"elapsed":12.54263475,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":516464484,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
