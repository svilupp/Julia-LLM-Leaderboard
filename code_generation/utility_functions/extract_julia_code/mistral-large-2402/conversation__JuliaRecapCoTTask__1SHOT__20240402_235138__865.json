[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

As per your instructions, this function will take a markdown document as input, extract all the Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's standard libraries:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x isa Markdown.Code, ast.content)\n    julia_code = join(filter(x -> x.info == \"julia\", code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return replace(replace(julia_code, \"```\" => \"\"), \"\\n\\n\" => \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how this function works:\n\n1. It first parses the markdown document into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using the `Markdown.parse` function.\n2. It then filters out all the nodes in the AST that represent code blocks.\n3. It further filters these code blocks to only keep those that are Julia code blocks (i.e., those with the info field set to \"julia\").\n4. It joins these Julia code blocks together with a newline.\n5. Finally, it removes the code fences (\"```\") and any extra newlines (\"\\n\\n\") from the result.","status":200,"tokens":[393,342],"elapsed":8.07388625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1942509158,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
