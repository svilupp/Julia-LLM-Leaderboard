It then filters out the code blocks that are not Julia code, and joins the remaining code together with a newline. The result is a string containing all the Julia code in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[84,181],"elapsed":4.258380291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-341782865,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
