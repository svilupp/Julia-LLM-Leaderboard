[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia. Here's a simple approach using Julia's built-in string processing and regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define a regex pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown string\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It defines a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks in a markdown string. The pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` matches strings that start with `` `julia` ``, followed by any character (including newlines, thanks to the `m` and `s` modifiers), and end with `` ` `` ``. The `.*?` part is a non-greedy matcher that captures the content inside the code fence.\n\n2. It uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the pattern in the input string.\n\n3. It extracts the code from each match (excluding the code fence) using the `captures` function and joins them with a newline.\n\n4. It returns the joined code blocks as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[391,373],"elapsed":9.838201042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1757208649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
