Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia. Here's a simple approach using Julia's built-in regular expressions and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = Regex(\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", s = dotall = true)\n\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join with newlines\n    code = join(map(m -> m.captures[1], matches), \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding all instances of Julia code blocks in the input string `md` using a regular expression. It then extracts the code from each match (excluding the code fences) and joins them together with newlines. The `dotall = true` option allows the regular expression to match across multiple lines.","status":200,"tokens":[219,243],"elapsed":6.118863917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1927354883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
