[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This function uses regular expressions to extract the code blocks between triple backticks (code fences) and then joins them together with a newline.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms, md)\n    codes = join(map(m -> replace(m.captures[1], r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    return codes\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. The `matchall` function is used with a regular expression to find all code blocks in the markdown document that are between triple backticks with `julia` specified. The `m` flag makes the dot `.` match newlines, and the `s` flag makes the dot match any character.\n\n2. The `map` function is used to replace newlines in each code block with a newline. This is necessary because the regular expression captures newlines as `\\n`.\n\n3. The `join` function is used to join all the code blocks together with a newline between each one.\n\n4. The function returns the joined code blocks as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,308],"elapsed":7.883304709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1532201525,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
