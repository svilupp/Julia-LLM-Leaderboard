It then filters out the code blocks that are Julia language code blocks. After that, it removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The resulting string is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[125,170],"elapsed":4.183672041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":456950706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
