X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on your problem statement, here's a systematic approach to solve the task:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and perhaps some functions to handle collections.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: Here's a function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    code = join(map(m -> replace(m.captures[1], r\"\\n$\" => \"\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first use the `matchall` function with a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown string. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` is a multiline pattern that matches a Julia code block, capturing the code inside.\n\nThen, we use `map` to process each match. For each match, we remove any trailing newlines with `replace`.\n\nFinally, we use `join` to combine all the processed code blocks into a single string, with two newlines between each block.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: I would typically test the function with various inputs to ensure it works as expected. However, as per your instructions, I haven't provided any examples.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all code blocks are properly formatted and that there are no nested code blocks. If the markdown document might contain improperly formatted code blocks or nested code blocks, a more complex parsing strategy might be needed.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `Regex` module from Julia's standard library, in line with your preference for using standard libraries over external packages. The type annotation `AbstractString` for the input is general, allowing for any string-like object.","status":200,"tokens":[393,490],"elapsed":13.641986875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":70296279,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
