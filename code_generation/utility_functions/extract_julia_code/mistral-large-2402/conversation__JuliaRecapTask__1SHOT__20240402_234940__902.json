[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you define a function in Julia to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document. Here's a simple approach using Julia's built-in regular expressions and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It defines a regular expression that matches Julia code blocks in a markdown document. The `m` flag makes the dot `.` match newlines, and the `s` flag makes the regex engine treat the string as a single line.\n\n2. It uses `matchall` to find all matches of the regular expression in the input string.\n\n3. It extracts the code from each match (excluding the code fences) and joins them with a newline.\n\n4. It returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[391,300],"elapsed":7.51001775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1732902677,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
