[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia. Given the task description and the special instructions, here's a function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x isa Markdown.Code, ast)\n\n    # Filter Julia code blocks\n    julia_blocks = filter(x -> x.info == \"julia\", code_blocks)\n\n    # Extract the code and join with newlines\n    code = join([string(x.code) for x in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first parsing the markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It then filters out all code blocks from the AST, and further filters to only keep Julia code blocks. Finally, it extracts the code from these blocks and joins them together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the `Markdown` package, which is part of the Julia standard library. Despite the initial guideline to avoid new packages, the `Markdown` package is not an external package and is included in the Julia standard library, so it's safe to use here.\n\nRemember to double-check the function with your actual use cases to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[393,343],"elapsed":8.757716625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":485921013,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
