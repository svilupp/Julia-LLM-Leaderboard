[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a systematic approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and control structures. The `match` function from the `Regex` module will be useful for finding code blocks, and the `join` function can be used to combine multiple code blocks together.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: Here's a function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define a pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them together with a newline\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: This function should correctly extract all Julia code blocks from a markdown string, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline. It uses the `matchall` function to find all matches of the pattern in the string, and a list comprehension to extract the code from each match. The `join` function is then used to combine the code blocks together. The function is type-stable and should perform well. It uses the `ms` modifiers in the regular expression to make `.` match newlines and to make `^` and `$` match the start and end of each line (rather than the whole string).","status":200,"tokens":[391,408],"elapsed":11.878537083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-604401192,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
