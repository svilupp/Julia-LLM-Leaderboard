[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function in Julia that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n    joined_code = join(replace.(code_blocks, r\"\\n\" => \"\"), \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `matchall` function finds all matches of the pattern in the string. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` is a regular expression that matches a Julia code block. The `m` and `s` modifiers make the `.` character match newlines and make the `^` and `$` anchors match the start and end of each line (rather than the whole string).\n\nThe `replace` function is used with a broadcast `.` to remove newlines from each code block. The `join` function then combines all the code blocks into a single string, with each code block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[219,265],"elapsed":7.428895292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":684664202,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
