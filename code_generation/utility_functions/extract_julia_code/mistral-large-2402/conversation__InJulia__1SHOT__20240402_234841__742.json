[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you define the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in regex and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block and remove the code fences\n    code_only = [replace(match.captures[1], r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\") for match in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_only, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first finding all Julia code blocks in the markdown using a regular expression. The `matchall` function returns an array of all matches. For each match, we extract the code inside the code fences and remove any newlines caused by the code fences. Finally, we join all code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[84,262],"elapsed":10.549411291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2080554858,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
