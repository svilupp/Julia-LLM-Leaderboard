[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    code = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_code_block\n            push!(code, replace(line, \"```\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis uses a boolean `in_code_block` to track whether we are inside a Julia code block. It splits the markdown into lines, and iterates through them to check for the julia code fence. If found, it flips the boolean. Inside a code block, it removes any remaining fences and adds the line to a `code` array. Finally it joins the array into a string with newlines.\n\nBy using abstract types and avoiding imports, this aims to focus on clarity and performance rather than over-specification.
