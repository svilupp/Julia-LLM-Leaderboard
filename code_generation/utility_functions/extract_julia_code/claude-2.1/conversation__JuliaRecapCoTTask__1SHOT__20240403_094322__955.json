[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It keeps track of whether it is currently inside a code block with the `incode` boolean. When it hits a julia code fence, it flips the `incode` boolean to enter/exit the code block. \n\nWhenever it is inside a code block, it collects those lines of code into a `code` array. After iterating the whole document, it joins the code array into a string with newlines and removes any remaining code fences.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[355,248],"elapsed":10.231466333,"cost":0.008792,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21247,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
