[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    code = []\n    incode = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            incode = !incode\n            continue\n        end\n        if incode\n            push!(code, replace(line, \"```\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis iterates through each line checking if it contains the julia code fence. If so, it flips the `incode` flag to track if we are inside or outside a code block. For lines inside code blocks, it stores them in a `code` array after removing any Residual backticks. Finally it joins the code array with newlines and returns it.\n\nBy using abstract types and not being overly specific in the type annotation, this allows `md` to be a `String` or `SubString` or other abstract string types. It emphasizes performance by preallocating `code` array and using `push!`. It prioritizes clarity with descriptive variable names and returns a `String` as requested.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[354,263],"elapsed":12.199519208,"cost":0.009144,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
