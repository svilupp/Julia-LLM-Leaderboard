[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = match(r\"```julia\\n(.*)\\n```\", md)\n    if isnothing(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else \n        code = map(x -> x.match, code_blocks) |> join(\"\\n\")\n        return code\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis uses a regular expression to match Julia code blocks surrounded by ```julia and ```` fences.
