It then processes these blocks by stripping away the surrounding code fences and concatenating multiple blocks together with newlines in between for clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[81,238],"elapsed":3.104444042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2084853284,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
