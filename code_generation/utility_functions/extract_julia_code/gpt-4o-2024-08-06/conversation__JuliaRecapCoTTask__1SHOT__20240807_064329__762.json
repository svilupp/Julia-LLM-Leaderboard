X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We need to find these blocks.\n\n2. **Extract Code Contents:** Once a Julia code block is identified, we'll extract the lines of code between the opening and closing backticks.\n\n3. **Handle Multiple Blocks:** In case there are multiple Julia code blocks, we'll join them together with newline characters.\n\n4. **Return the Extracted Code:** Finally, return the concatenated string of all extracted code.\n\nLet's proceed with the function implementation.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    julia_code_blocks = []  # Initialize a collection for julia code blocks\n    in_julia_block = false  # Flag to check if we are inside a julia code block\n    current_block = \"\"      # To accumulate code lines of a single block\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"  # Reset for a new block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Accumulate lines if we're inside a julia code block\n        if in_julia_block\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a list `julia_code_blocks` to store each Julia code block and set a flag `in_julia_block` to track when we are inside a Julia code block.\n\n- **Iterating Lines**: We iterate over each line in the markdown document, splitting by newline characters.\n\n- **Detect Opening & Closing Fences**: If a line matches the opening of a Julia code block (` ```julia`), we set the `in_julia_block` flag to true. If it matches a closing fence (` ``` `) and `in_julia_block` is true, we save the collected block, reset the collection, and toggle the flag off.\n\n- **Accumulate Code Lines**: When inside a Julia code block, we accumulate lines by appending them to `current_block` with a newline.\n\n- **Return**: Finally, we join all stored blocks with newlines and return them as a single string.\n\nThis code snippet effectively extracts and concatenates Julia code blocks from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[338,597],"elapsed":6.518864042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2146948606,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
