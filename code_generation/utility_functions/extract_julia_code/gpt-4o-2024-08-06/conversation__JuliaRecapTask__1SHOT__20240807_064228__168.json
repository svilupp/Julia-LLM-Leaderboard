X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Markdown uses triple backticks (```) to delimit code blocks. Code blocks specifically for Julia should begin with ```julia, and they end with another triple backtick. Here's how we will approach this problem:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Locate all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. These blocks are enclosed between ```julia and ```. \n   \n2. **Extract the Code**: Remove any markdown-specific fencing (``` and ```julia) to isolate just the inner Julia code.\n\n3. **Concatenate Code Blocks**: If there are multiple code blocks, concatenate them using a newline character.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Provide a single string containing all the extracted code.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We can use regular expressions to search for and extract the contents of Julia code blocks.\n- The regular expression can capture content between ```julia and ```, ensuring we gather the content regardless of how many lines or characters it spans.\n- Finally, we join extracted code snippets with a newline separator.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # A regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    # (?s) is used for dot-all mode, allowing `.` to match newline characters\n    julia_block_regex = r\"(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of Julia code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(julia_block_regex, md))\n    \n    # Extract the code content, stripping out the markdown fences\n    julia_code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Concatenate the code blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Regex Pattern**: `(?s)```julia\\n(.*?)````\n  - `(?s)`: Enables dot to match newline characters, allowing us to capture multi-line blocks.\n  - ```julia\\n```: Matches the opening of a Julia code block.\n  - `(.*?)`: Non-greedy capture group to match any content until the closing ```.\n- **Regex Match Extraction**: We use `eachmatch` to find all non-overlapping matches within the input string, each containing a `captures` field where the Julia code (minus the fences) is stored.\n- **Concatenation**: We join multiple extracted blocks with newlines to form the final string output.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes and extracts code blocks tailored for Julia, adhering to the typical structure of markdown documents while optimizing for clarity and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[337,561],"elapsed":6.182497375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-620093496,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
