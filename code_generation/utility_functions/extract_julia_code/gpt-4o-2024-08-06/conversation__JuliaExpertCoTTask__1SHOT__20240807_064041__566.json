[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: We'll identify all code blocks in the markdown document that are fenced with triple backticks, specifically those labeled with `julia`.\n2. **Extract and Clean Code**: After identifying, we'll extract the text within each code block and remove the fences.\n3. **Join Code Blocks**: If there are multiple code blocks, we'll join them with a newline.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the concatenated string containing all the Julia code.\n\nLet's implement the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Use a regular expression to match `julia` fenced code blocks\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s  # non-greedy match all content between fences\n    matches = match.(julia_code_pattern, eachmatch(julia_code_pattern, md))\n    # Extract the captured group (content inside the code block) and join with newline\n    return join(match.match for match in matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We use a regular expression to match the pattern for Julia code blocks.\n- The regex pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` captures all text between `julia` code fences non-greedily.\n- `eachmatch` finds all matches in the markdown string.\n- We then iterate over these matches and extract the captured group (`match.match`) containing the code.\n- Finally, we join all extracted code blocks with a newline and return the result.\n\nThis ensures we cleanly extract and concatenate any Julia code blocks present in the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[190,352],"elapsed":3.733484,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1188896507,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
