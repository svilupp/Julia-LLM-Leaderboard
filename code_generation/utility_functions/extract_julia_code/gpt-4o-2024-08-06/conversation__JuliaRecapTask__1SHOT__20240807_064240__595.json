[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to write a Julia function that processes a string representing a Markdown document, identifying and extracting code written in Julia from code blocks. \n\nWe'll follow these steps:\n1. Identify code blocks in the Markdown: Markdown code blocks start and end with triple backticks (```) and optionally specify a language after the opening backticks.\n2. Search for code blocks that specifically declare Julia as the language (` ```julia `).\n3. Extract the content of these code blocks.\n4. Remove the backticks and combine all extracted Julia code blocks, inserting a newline between them for separation.\n5. Return the combined result as a single string.\n\nNow, let's implement the `extract_julia_code` function using these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split the markdown by newlines to process it line by line\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_julia_block = false  # Flag to determine if we are inside a julia code block\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]  # Array to store lines of julia code\n    \n    # Iterating line by line\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if line starts a Julia code block\n        if occursin(r\"^```julia\\s*$\", line)\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if line ends a code block\n        if occursin(r\"^```\\s*$\", line) && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If inside a julia code block, add line to code blocks\n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all lines with newlines\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialize**:\n  - `in_julia_block` is set to `false` initially, indicating we are outside any code block.\n  - `julia_code_blocks` is an empty array to accumulate lines of code.\n\n- **Process Lines**:\n  - For each line, check if it starts a Julia code block with `occurins` and a regular expression that matches ` ```julia ` pattern.\n  - If a line signifies the start of a Julia block, set `in_julia_block` to `true` and skip the line as it just marks the beginning.\n  - If a line signifies the end of the code block within a Julia block, toggle `in_julia_block` to `false` and skip it.\n  - If `in_julia_block` is `true`, the line is inside a Julia code block and is added to `julia_code_blocks`.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - Use `join` to concatenate all collected lines with a newline character between them and return this as the output.\n\nThis implementation oriented around clear description handling is efficient for processing Markdown documents with code blocks within them.","status":200,"tokens":[337,625],"elapsed":6.444765917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":933897650,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
