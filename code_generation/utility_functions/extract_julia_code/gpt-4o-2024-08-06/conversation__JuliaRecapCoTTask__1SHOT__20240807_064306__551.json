X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We need to identify code blocks in a markdown text and extract them, if they're Julia code. Here’s how we’ll proceed:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: Look for ```julia```, which is the conventional indicator for Julia code blocks in markdown. These blocks start with ```julia and end with ```.\n\n2. **Extract Code**: Isolate the contents between these start and end markers.\n\n3. **Concatenate**: If there're multiple Julia code blocks, concatenate them into a single string separated by newlines.\n\n4. **Return the Output**: Return the final compiled string of Julia code.\n\nI'll write the function `extract_julia_code` adhering to these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match julia code blocks\n    julia_block_regex = r\"```julia\\s+(.*?)\\s+```\"s\n    \n    # Use findall to extract all matches\n    matches = findall(julia_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the captured codes from the matches\n    julia_code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all blocks using a newline separator\n    combined_code = join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Regular Expression**: The regex `r\"```julia\\s+(.*?)\\s+```\"s` looks for:\n  - ```` ```julia```` followed by one or more whitespace characters (`\\s+`) and then,\n  - Captures everything lazily up to the next occurrence of ` ``` `.\n- **Find Matches**: `findall` returns all non-overlapping regex matches, capturing the contained code in `captures[1]`.\n- **Combining Code Blocks**: `join` is used to concatenate these code snippets together with a newline.\n\nThis implementation should effectively handle the markdown Julia code extraction as described.","status":200,"tokens":[338,432],"elapsed":5.009322416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1210205207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
