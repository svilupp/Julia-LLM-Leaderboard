[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task in Julia, you'll need to parse the markdown document and identify the code blocks specifically written in the Julia language. Then, you'll extract and concatenate the code without the accompanying markdown code fences. Here's how you can write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Initialize an empty vector to collect Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    # Split the markdown document by newline\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # State variable to track if we're inside a julia code block\n    in_julia_code_block = false\n    \n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown document\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a code block fence with julia specified\n        if occursin(r\"^```julia\\s*$\", line)\n            in_julia_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if the line is a closing code block fence\n        if occursin(r\"^```\\s*$\", line) && in_julia_code_block\n            in_julia_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are inside a julia code block, collect the line\n        if in_julia_code_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join collected julia code blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows these steps:\n\n1. It initializes an empty list to store the extracted code blocks.\n2. It splits the input markdown string into lines.\n3. It iterates over each line, using a state variable `in_julia_code_block` to track whether the loop is within a Julia code block.\n4. When it finds a line starting with ```julia, it updates the state variable to indicate the beginning of a Julia code block.\n5. It adds lines within a Julia code block to the collected list.\n6. When it encounters a closing ```, it updates the state variable, indicating the end of the code block.\n7. Finally, it joins all collected code lines into a single string separated by newlines and returns it.\n\nThis function should handle multiple julia code blocks within the markdown text correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[81,479],"elapsed":4.828515292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1083916618,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
