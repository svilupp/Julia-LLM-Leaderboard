X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's the systematic approach to the solution:\n\n### Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n- **Regular Expressions**: These are useful for locating the start and end of code fences in markdown.\n- **Concatenation and String Operations**: Join multiline strings with a newline separator.\n- **I/O Operations**: Read line-by-line when iterating through text data.\n- **String Manipulation**: To slice and join sections of text.\n\n### Implement the Solution\n\n1. Initialize an accumulator for storing the code blocks.\n2. Iterate through lines of the markdown document.\n3. Use a flag to track if we are inside a Julia code block.\n4. Append lines to the accumulator when inside a code block.\n5. Join the code collected from all blocks with a newline.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_julia_block = false\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(r\"^```julia\\s*$\", line)\n            in_julia_block = !in_julia_block\n            append!(code_blocks, \"\")  # Add an empty string to separate blocks when exiting block\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(filter(x -> !isempty(x), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Double-Check the Solution\n- **Regular Expression**: Ensure the regex correctly captures the fenced code block indicator.\n- **Logical Conditions**: Check if the logic correctly toggles the `in_julia_block` state.\n- **Edge Cases**: Consider if markdown may have no code, or irregular use of code blocks.\n\nThis implementation should correctly identify, extract, and concatenate all Julia code segments from the markdown content provided.","status":200,"tokens":[338,412],"elapsed":4.767979792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":243684022,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
