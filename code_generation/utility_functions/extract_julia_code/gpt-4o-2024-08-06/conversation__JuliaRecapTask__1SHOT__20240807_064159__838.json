[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to extract Julia code blocks from a given markdown document. Markdown code blocks for a specific language, such as Julia, are typically enclosed with triple backticks followed by the language identifier.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: We look for triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\" (` ```julia`).\n2. **Extract the Code**: Collect all the lines between ` ```julia` and the corresponding closing triple backticks ` ``` `.\n3. **Combine Extracted Code**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, they should be concatenated with a newline separating each extracted block.\n4. **Return as a Single String**: The result should be a single string with all Julia code combined.\n\nI'll implement this function in Julia using regular expressions for precise matching and extraction.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Initialize an array to collect all Julia code snippets\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    \n    # Pattern to match a julia code block in the markdown\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\s([\\s\\S]*?)\\s```\"\n    \n    # Use the findall function to get all matches\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Push each Julia code block found to the collection, trimming the match\n        push!(julia_code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the collected code blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `pattern` uses the regular expression `r\"```julia\\s([\\s\\S]*?)\\s```\"`:\n  - ` ```julia\\s` matches the opening of a Julia code block, ensuring it starts with ` ```julia` followed by a whitespace.\n  - `([\\s\\S]*?)` captures all characters (including newlines) in a non-greedy way until it encounters a close.\n  - `\\s``` ` looks for the closing triple backticks preceded by whitespace.\n- `eachmatch` is used to iterate over all matches of the `pattern` in the input `md`.\n- `match.captures[1]` extracts the actual code content from each captured match.\n- `push!` adds each captured code snippet to the `julia_code_blocks` array.\n- `join` concatenates all code snippets with a newline separator, providing the desired output format.\n\nThis solution efficiently extracts and combines all Julia code blocks from the markdown input.","status":200,"tokens":[337,535],"elapsed":5.496067209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":935253914,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
