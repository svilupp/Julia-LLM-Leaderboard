[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you'll need to write a function in Julia that processes a markdown document to extract Julia code blocks. Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    inside_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check for the start of a julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            inside_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check for the end of a code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            inside_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Collect lines inside a Julia code block\n        if inside_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows these steps:\n1. Splits the input markdown document by lines.\n2. Iterates over each line to detect the start and end of Julia code blocks using \"```julia\" and terminating \"```\".\n3. Collects the lines which are inside Julia code blocks.\n4. Joins the collected lines with a newline and returns the result as a single string. \n\nThis implementation assumes well-formed markdown with properly opened and closed code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[81,297],"elapsed":3.214955,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1585955244,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
