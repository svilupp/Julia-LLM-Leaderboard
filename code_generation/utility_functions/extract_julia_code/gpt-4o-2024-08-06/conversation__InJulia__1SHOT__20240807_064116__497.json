Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document and combine them into a single string, you can use regular expressions to identify and process the code blocks. Here's how you can implement the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression pattern to match julia code blocks \n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"sm\n    # Find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the captured groups and join them with newlines\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regular Expression**: The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"sm` is used to detect code blocks marked with ` ```julia` at the beginning and closed with ` ``` `. \n   - `s` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters, ensuring multiline code can be captured.\n   - `m` flag treats the string as multiple lines, which makes `^` and `$` match the start and end of any line.\n\n2. **Capture Group**: `(.*?)` captures everything between the opening and closing code fences. The `?` makes it non-greedy, so it captures the shortest possible string between the fences.\n\n3. **Matching**: `eachmatch(pattern, md)` provides an iterator over all matches of the pattern in the string `md`.\n\n4. **Capture Extraction**: `[match.captures[1] for match in matches]` extracts the first capturing group (our code content) from each match.\n\n5. **Joining**: `join(..., \"\\n\")` combines all extracted blocks into a single string with newlines separating them.\n\nThis function will effectively extract all Julia code blocks from a markdown document, strip the enclosing markers, and concatenate the content, providing a clean output ready for further processing or execution.","status":200,"tokens":[81,409],"elapsed":4.276731292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-564656325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
