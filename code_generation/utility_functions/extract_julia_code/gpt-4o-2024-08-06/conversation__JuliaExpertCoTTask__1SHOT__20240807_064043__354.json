Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To address the task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify julia code blocks within the markdown document.\n2. Remove markdown fences from the identified code blocks.\n3. Concatenate the extracted code blocks with a newline separator.\n4. Return the final concatenated string.\n\nLet's implement the function now:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a regex pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"m\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the provided markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the content of each match (remove the surrounding fences)\n    extracted_code_blocks = [m.match[1] for m in matches]\n    \n    # Join all extracted code blocks with a newline\n    concatenated_code = join(extracted_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return concatenated_code\nend\n```\n\nThis solution will correctly extract and process all Julia code blocks from the given markdown input. Now, ensure this function works as intended by calling it with the provided test data.","status":200,"tokens":[190,234],"elapsed":2.548889708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1837224987,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
