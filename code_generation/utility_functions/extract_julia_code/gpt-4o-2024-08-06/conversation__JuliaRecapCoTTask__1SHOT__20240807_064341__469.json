[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Recalling Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- String manipulation: Methods like `match`, `replace`, `occursin`.\n- Regular Expressions (Regex) for pattern matching.\n- Looping through lines of a string.\n- Concatenating strings.\n\n### Task Steps:\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Use regular expressions to find fences marked with triple backticks and ensure the code is in Julia.\n2. **Extract Code**: Collect code lines between the Julia code block markers. \n3. **Join Code Blocks**: If multiple code blocks are present, join them with a newline separator.\n4. **Return the Resulting String**: Return the aggregated code string.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to capture julia code block\n    regex = r\"```julia\\s(.*?)```\"ms\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n    \n    # Initialize an array to store extracted code\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    # Iterate over all matches to extract the code part\n    for m in matches\n        code = m.captures[1]\n        push!(code_blocks, strip(code))  # Strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with newlines\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Double-checking the solution\n- **Regex Structure**: The Regex `r\"```julia\\s(.*?)```\"ms` correctly identifies the opening and closing of a Julia code block.\n  - `m`: Multiline match.\n  - `s`: Dot matches newline.\n- **Solution Behavior**: Extracts all identified code blocks, strips unnecessary whitespace, and concatenates with newlines.\n- **Edge Cases**: Considers no code blocks or varying whitespace by relying on flexible regex and string operations.\n- **Correctness**: Returns joined code as expected in a single string. \n\nThis function effectively extracts and compiles Julia code from markdown documents as per the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[338,434],"elapsed":12.141615792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1055761619,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
