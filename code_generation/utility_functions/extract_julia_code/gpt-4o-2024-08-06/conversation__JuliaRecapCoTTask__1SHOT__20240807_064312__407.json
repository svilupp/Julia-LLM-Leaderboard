[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task of extracting Julia language code blocks from a markdown document and joining them into a single string, we'll follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\n- **Regex for Matching Patterns**: We'll utilize regular expressions to match the Julia code blocks within the markdown document.\n- **String Manipulation**: We need to efficiently handle strings, including splitting and joining them.\n- **Loop through Matches**: We'll loop through all occurrences of Julia code blocks.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks** in a markdown document using delimiters such as triple backticks (```) and possibly specifying the language as `julia`.\n   \n2. **Extract Code**: Using a regex pattern, extract all parts of the document between the delimiter that are specifically marked for the Julia language.\n   \n3. **Clean and Join**: Remove any extraneous markdown syntax (such as the language label) and join all code blocks into one single string.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the contents of the matches (the actual code), ignoring the code fences\n    julia_code_blocks = [m.matchdata[1] for m in matches]\n    \n    # Join all extracted code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\n- **Pattern Match**: Ensure the regex correctly identifies only Julia code blocks and captures the code within.\n- **Edge Cases**: Verify with no code block, single code block, and multiple code blocks scenarios.\n- **Return Type**: Confirming that the function returns a singular string with concatenated code blocks.\n\nThis implementation should efficiently extract and concatenate the Julia code sections from a markdown document per the instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[338,429],"elapsed":5.237341292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1209304,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
