Use a regular expression to find sections of the markdown document that are identified as Julia code blocks.\n2. Remove the code fences from each of these blocks.\n3. Join these blocks together using a newline as a separator.\n\nHere's a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression pattern for Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all Julia code blocks\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract code from each match and remove the code fences\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the blocks together with newlines\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression with the `s` flag to ensure that the `.` wildcard can match newline characters. Each captured group (i.e., the code within the ```julia ... ````) is extracted and joined with newline characters. The `join` function then concatenates these code blocks into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[81,286],"elapsed":3.478208417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-491397964,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
