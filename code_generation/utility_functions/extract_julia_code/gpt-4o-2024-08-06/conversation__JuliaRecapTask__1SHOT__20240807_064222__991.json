[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, let's break down the steps systematically:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks:**\n   - Markdown syntax for code blocks typically uses triple backticks (```) as fences.\n   - Specifically, Julia code blocks use ```julia as the opening line, followed by lines of code, and closed by a ``` line.\n\n2. **Extract Code Blocks:**\n   - We'll iterate over the lines of the markdown text.\n   - Detect the start of a Julia code block with the opening fence ```julia.\n   - Collect lines until we hit the closing fence ```.\n\n3. **Remove Code Fences:**\n   - We need to ignore the opening and closing fences, gathering only the actual Julia code.\n\n4. **Concatenate Code:**\n   - If there are multiple Julia code blocks, concatenate them with newlines.\n\nLet's translate this into a function called `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) :: String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the markdown content into lines\n    julia_code = String[]    # Array to collect lines of Julia code\n    inside_julia_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            inside_julia_block = true  # Start collecting lines\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            inside_julia_block = false # End collecting lines\n        elseif inside_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code, line)    # Collect lines within Julia code block\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\")      # Join all collected code with newlines\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`lines = split(md, '\\n')`:** Splits the markdown text into individual lines for processing.\n- **`inside_julia_block`:** A flag to track when we are inside a Julia code block.\n- **`starts_with(line, \"```julia\")`:** Detects the beginning of a Julia code block.\n- **`starts_with(line, \"```\")`:** Detects the end of a code block.\n- **`push!(julia_code, line)`:** Adds the current line to the `julia_code` array if inside a Julia block.\n- **`join(julia_code, \"\\n\")`:** Combines all gathered Julia code lines into a single string, separated by newlines.\n\n### Double-Check:\n- Handles multiple Julia code blocks by appending lines together.\n- Properly ignores non-Julia code blocks.\n- Correctly manages code block delimiters by only capturing relevant code.\n\nThis solution is efficient and aligns with standard practices in Julia, ensuring the task is completed effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[337,575],"elapsed":6.623814625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-118485467,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
