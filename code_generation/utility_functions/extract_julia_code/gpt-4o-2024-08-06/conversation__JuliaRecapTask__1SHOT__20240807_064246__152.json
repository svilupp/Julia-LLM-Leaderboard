[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we will take the following approach:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Markdown code blocks are usually wrapped with triple backticks (```` ``` ````), and for Julia specifically, they might be indicated with `julia` right after the opening backticks (e.g., ```` ```julia ````).\n\n2. **Extract and Clean**: For each identified code block, remove the markings (the triple backticks and language identifier) and then store the raw code.\n\n3. **Join and Return**: If there's more than one code block, join all code segments with a newline character to create a single cohesive string.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    in_julia_block = false\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialize**: Start by initializing an empty array `julia_code_blocks` to store lines of Julia code as we extract them. A boolean `in_julia_block` helps track whether we're within a Julia code block.\n\n- **Iterate Lines**: Loop through each line of the markdown document:\n  - **Detect Start**: Detect the start of a Julia code block with `startswith(line, \"```julia\")` and change the boolean flag `in_julia_block` to `true`.\n  - **Detect End**: Detect the end of any code block with `startswith(line, \"```\"`) only if we're currently inside a Julia code block, and set the flag `in_julia_block` to `false`.\n  - **Collect Code**: If we're within a Julia code block (`in_julia_block` is `true`), add the line to `julia_code_blocks`.\n\n- **Join Blocks**: Once the loop finishes, use `join` to concatenate each extracted code segment with a newline character.\n\nThis function will effectively extract and combine all Julia snippets from a markdown document, omitting the markdown-specific syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[337,516],"elapsed":5.736194084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":395762731,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
