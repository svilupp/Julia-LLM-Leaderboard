Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: Look for code fences (` ```julia ` and ` ``` `) marking the start and end of Julia code blocks.\n2. **Extract Code**: Remove these fences from the blocks and retrieve the code.\n3. **Combine Code Blocks**: If there are multiple code blocks, join them with a newline.\n4. **Return a String**: Return a single string of combined code.\n\nLet's implement the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code_blocks = []\n    inside_code_block = false\n    current_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            inside_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && inside_code_block\n            inside_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if inside_code_block\n            current_block *= (isempty(current_block) ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n**Check the Solution**: We will ensure the function works by imagining multiple inputs but refrain from executing as no examples are required per the task instruction. The provided function correctly parses and joins Julia code blocks into a single cohesive string.","status":200,"tokens":[190,301],"elapsed":3.507396833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1433611544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
