[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Problem Solving Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Markdown Structure**: Markdown code blocks are defined with triple backticks \"```\". For Julia code blocks, they start with \"```julia\".\n\n2. **Extract Julia Code Blocks**: We need to identify these blocks and extract the code within them.\n\n3. **Handle Multiple Code Blocks**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we need to concatenate them with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\n4. **Remove Code Fences**: We will strip away the \"```julia\" at the start and \"```\" at the end of each block.\n\n5. **Combine the Code**: Combine all extracted code into one string with a newline between them.\n\n6. **Implement Function**: Write a function `extract_julia_code` to execute the above steps.\n\n## Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to find julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract code from each match group\n    julia_codes = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the extracted code with new lines\n    return join(julia_codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n## Check the Solution:\n\n- Ensure the function can take a markdown string and return a single string containing all the Julia code.\n- Ensure the code is properly extracted without the markdown fences.\n\nImplementing the above function will fulfill the task of extracting Julia code from markdown strings effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[190,336],"elapsed":3.661729459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1065648977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
