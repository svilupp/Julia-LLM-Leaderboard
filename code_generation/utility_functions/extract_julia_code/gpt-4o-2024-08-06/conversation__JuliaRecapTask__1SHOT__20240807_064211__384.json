[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task of extracting Julia language code blocks from a markdown document and concatenating them, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks:** Look for lines starting and ending with triple backticks (```) which specify the start and end of code blocks in markdown. Additionally, ensure the fence line contains the word `julia` to filter only Julia code blocks.\n   \n2. **Collect Code Lines:** After identifying the start of a Julia code block, gather all subsequent lines until another triple backtick line is detected, marking the end of the block.\n\n3. **Concatenate:** Accumulate the extracted lines from all identified blocks and concatenate them, separating each block with a newline.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the function `extract_julia_code` which performs these steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the markdown content by new lines\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]  # Store collected julia code blocks\n    \n    in_julia_block = false\n    current_block = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") && !in_julia_block\n            # Start of a Julia code block\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_julia_block\n            # End of a Julia code block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, '\\n'))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_julia_block\n            # Collect lines when inside a Julia code block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all collected julia code blocks with a newline in between\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We make use of a boolean flag `in_julia_block` to track whether we're currently inside a Julia code block.\n- The collected code is appended to `current_block` until the end of the code block is reached, at which point it is joined into a single string and added to `julia_code_blocks`.\n- Finally, all blocks are joined into a single string separated by double newlines to maintain clear separation between code sections if multiple blocks were found.\n\nThis approach ensures we only extract Julia-specific code blocks and handles multiple blocks efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[337,503],"elapsed":4.984802792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1707383621,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
