[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the Markdown Content:** We'll be provided with a markdown string, so we need to process it line by line.\n2. **Identify Julia Code Blocks:** Markdown code blocks are usually denoted by triple backticks (```) with an optional language identifier. We'll look for code blocks that specify `julia` after the backticks.\n3. **Extract and Accumulate Julia Code:** Once we identify a Julia code block, we'll extract all lines until we encounter the closing triple backticks. We'll accumulate these lines into a single string.\n4. **Join Code Blocks with Newlines:** If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we will join them with a newline to form a contiguous Julia code string.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    current_block = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # Start of a Julia code block\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # End of a code block\n            in_code_block = false\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n                empty!(current_block)\n            end\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Collect lines within a julia code block\n        if in_code_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all extracted code blocks with newlines\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We first split the markdown string into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n- We iterate through each line and use flags to detect when we're inside a Julia code block.\n- When a line starts with ```julia, we turn on the `in_code_block` flag to start collecting lines.\n- When we encounter a closing triple backticks (```) line, we append the current block of code to our list of code blocks and reset the buffer.\n- Finally, we join all collected code blocks with newlines and return them as a single string.\n\nThis approach should efficiently accumulate and extract all Julia code from the given markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[338,511],"elapsed":5.213402875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1581154302,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
