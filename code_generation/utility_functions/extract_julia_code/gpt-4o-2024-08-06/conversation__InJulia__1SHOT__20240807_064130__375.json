Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can create a function called `extract_julia_code` that processes the markdown document and extracts the Julia code blocks. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) :: String\n    # Use a regular expression to capture lines between julia fences\n    julia_fence_re = r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    # Find all matches for the pattern\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_fence_re, md)\n    \n    # Extract the captured groups (the code blocks) from each match\n    code_blocks = [match.match[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Regular Expression**: The function uses a regular expression to match the Julia code blocks. The pattern `r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` helps to extract the content between the code fences:\n   - ` ```julia\\s*\\n` matches the start of a Julia code block, accounting for any whitespace after \"julia\" and capturing the newline character.\n   - `(.*?)` captures all content inside the code block non-greedily (as few characters as needed).\n   - `\\n``` ` matches the closing code fence of the block.\n   - The `s` flag allows the `.` in the regex to match newline characters as well.\n\n2. **eachmatch() Function**: This function is used to find all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the markdown string.\n\n3. **Collecting the Matches**: The code blocks are extracted from each match and stored in an array.\n\n4. **Joining with Newline**: All extracted code blocks are joined together using a newline character to form a single string output.\n\nThis function will return a single string containing all the Julia code extracted from the markdown document, with each block separated by a newline if there are multiple blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[81,425],"elapsed":5.0887645,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1385297403,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
