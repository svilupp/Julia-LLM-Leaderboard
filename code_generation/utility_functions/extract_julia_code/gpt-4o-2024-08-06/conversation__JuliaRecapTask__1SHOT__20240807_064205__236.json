X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's how we can systematically implement the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**:\n   - In Markdown, code blocks are enclosed by triple backticks ``` and optionally specify a language, e.g., ```julia.\n  \n2. **Parse the Markdown Document**:\n   - Traverse the document line by line.\n   - Identify when you're starting a Julia code block (` ```julia `) and when it ends (` ``` `).\n\n3. **Extract and Collect Julia Code**:\n   - Once a Julia code block is identified, collect the lines of code until you reach the closing triple backticks.\n   - Concatenate all lines of code from all Julia blocks, separating them with a newline character.\n\n4. **Return the Combined Julia Code String**.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]  # array to hold the lines\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && occursin(r\"^\\s*```julia\\s*$\", line) && !in_code_block\n            # Enter a Julia code block\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            # Exit the Julia code block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            # Collect the code within a detected Julia code block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all lines with a newline character\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Splitting the Document:** We first split the entire markdown content by lines.\n- **State Tracking:** A boolean `in_code_block` tracks whether we're currently inside a Julia code block.\n- **Regex Matching:** The function uses a regular expression to distinguish Julia code block openers specifically.\n- **Concatenation:** As we process, we collect lines in `julia_code_blocks`, which are finally joined by newlines.\n\nThis function systematically collects and returns all Julia code sections from the markdown input, ensuring code blocks are delineated cleanly by newlines. Ensure that the input markdown string has valid content before processing, as this code does not perform extensive error checking for malformed Markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[337,532],"elapsed":6.292461291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-460504381,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
