[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll need to follow these steps systematically:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks:** We need to locate the markdown code fences that specify Julia code blocks. In Markdown, a code block usually starts with triple backticks followed by an optional language identifier, e.g., ```` ```julia ````.\n\n2. **Extract Code Content:** Extract the lines between the code fences ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ````.\n\n3. **Concatenate Code Blocks:** If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we need to concatenate them with a newline character.\n\n4. **Return a Single String:** Finally, return the concatenated string containing all the Julia code without the markdown fences.\n\nNow, let's translate this into the function `extract_julia_code`. I'll write the function without example output, as per the task requirements.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    julia_code = IOBuffer()\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_code_block\n            println(julia_code, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return String(take!(julia_code))\nend\n```\n\n### Double-checking the Solution:\n- The code uses `split(md, '\\n')` to get an array of lines from the markdown document.\n- It leverages a boolean `in_code_block` to track whether we are inside a Julia code block.\n- Using `IOBuffer` to efficiently collect code lines and then extracting the result with `take!` ensures the output is managed correctly.\n- It matches the beginning and end of Julia code blocks correctly, handling multiple blocks by appending a newline between them.\n- We ensure that non-Julia or other markdown elements are not accidentally included by correct usage of the `in_code_block` flag.\n\nThis function should meet the outlined requirements, extracting Julia code while maintaining readability and correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[338,447],"elapsed":4.933014083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-808990727,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
