[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The strategy involves identifying the regions between the code fences that specify Julia (` ```julia `) and capturing the enclosed code. Here's the approach to achieve this:\n\n### Julia Snippets to Recall:\n\n1. **Regular Expressions**: Useful for pattern matching.\n   - Capture group: `r\"pattern\"`\n   - Regex flags: `s` for dot matches newlines\n   \n2. **String Manipulations**:\n   - Concatenation: `*` or string interpolation\n   - Joining strings: `join(array_of_strings, \"\\n\")`\n   - Splitting strings: `split(string, delimiter)`\n   \n3. **Iterators**:\n   - Filtering: `filter(predicate, collection)`\n   - Mapping: `map(function, collection)`\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**:\n   - A code block begins with a line containing ` ```julia ` and ends with a closing line of ` ``` `.\n   - Use regular expressions to identify and capture these blocks.\n\n2. **Extract and Concatenate**:\n   - Remove the code fences from the extracted content.\n   - Store the code snippets in a list, then join them with a newline character.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - The concatenated string of all Julia code blocks.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to capture the julia code blocks\n    # Using (?s) to allow . to match newline characters, (?m) for multiline mode\n    pat = r\"(?s)(?<=```julia\\n)(.*?)(?=```)\"\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = matchall(pat, md)\n    \n    # Join the matches into a single string separated by newline\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function should correctly extract and concatenate all the Julia code blocks within the markdown string. The regular expression pattern `(?<=```julia\\n)(.*?)(?=```)` precisely matches the content of code blocks initiated by ` ```julia ` and terminated with ` ``` `. By utilizing non-greedy quantifier (`*?`), it captures the minimal content required for each block, ensuring correct extraction even with multiple blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[338,488],"elapsed":5.037327709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-332363524,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
