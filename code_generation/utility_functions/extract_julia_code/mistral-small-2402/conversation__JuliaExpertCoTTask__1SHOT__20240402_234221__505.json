Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document and returns a string:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:.|\\n)*?)\\n```\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the matches and append the extracted code to the string\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the code fences and join the lines with a newline\n        code *= replace(match[1], \"```julia\\n\" => \"\", \"\\n```\" => \"\\n\")\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code string\n    return code\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a string `md` containing a markdown document as input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code blocks. It defines a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document, finds all matches of the regular expression, and appends the extracted code to a string. Finally, it returns the string containing the extracted Julia code.\n\nThe regular expression `code_block_regex` matches a sequence of three backticks followed by \"julia\", zero or more characters (including newlines), and then a sequence of three backticks. The `ms` flags make the regular expression case-insensitive and allow it to match across multiple lines.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown document. The `replace` function is used to remove the code fences and join the lines of the code block with a newline. The resulting string is then appended to the `code` variable.\n\nIf there are multiple code blocks in the markdown document, they will be joined together in the returned string with a newline between each block. If there are no code blocks, the function will return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[219,490],"elapsed":5.386687334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2116659002,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
