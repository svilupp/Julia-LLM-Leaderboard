[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It uses a simple state machine to keep track of whether it is currently inside a code block, and if so, where the code block started. When it encounters a code fence, it checks if it is the end of the code block, and if so, it adds the current code block to the `code_blocks` array and resets the state machine. If the function ends without finding an end to the current code block, it adds the remaining markdown text to the `code_blocks` array. Finally, it returns the joined `code_blocks` array as a single string.\n\nHere are some notes on the implementation:\n\n* The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the markdown document.\n* It uses a `Bool` variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether it is currently inside a code block.\n* It uses an `Int` variable `code_block_start` to keep track of the index of the first character in the current code block.\n* It pushes each code block to an array `code_blocks` using the `push!` function.\n* It joins the `code_blocks` array into a single string using the `join` function, with a newline as the separator.\n* The function uses the `AbstractString` type for the markdown document argument to make it more abstract and flexible.\n* The function uses multiple dispatch to handle both `String` and `SubString` arguments.\n* The function does not check for invalid markdown syntax or code blocks that are not Julia code.\n* The function assumes that all code fences are tripled backticks (`````), as is common in markdown.\n\nOverall, this implementation should be efficient and clear, while also adhering to the guidelines for Julia style and syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[391,686],"elapsed":7.550584167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-385824616,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
