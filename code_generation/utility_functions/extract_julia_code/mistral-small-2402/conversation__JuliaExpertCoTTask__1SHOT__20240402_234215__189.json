[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use a regular expression to find code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia[\\n\\r]+([\\s\\S]*?)[\\n\\r]+```\", md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each code block and join them together with a newline\n    extracted_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all code blocks within the markdown string. The regular expression ````julia[\\n\\r]+([\\s\\S]*?)[\\n\\r]+``` matches a code fence with `julia` as the language identifier, followed by any number of newline characters, then any number of any characters (the code), then any number of newline characters, and finally another code fence.\n\nThe `matchall` function returns an array of all matches, and the `captures` field of each match contains the code within the code fence. The function then joins all the code together with a double newline, and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[219,296],"elapsed":3.382053292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-135669377,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
