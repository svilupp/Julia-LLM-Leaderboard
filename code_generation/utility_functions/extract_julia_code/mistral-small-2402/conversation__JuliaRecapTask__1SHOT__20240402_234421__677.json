[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It iterates through the parsed nodes, checks if the node is a CodeBlock with the language set to \"julia\" (case-insensitive), and if so, removes the code fences and adds the code block to the result string with a newline if it's not the first code block. Finally, it returns the string of extracted Julia code blocks.\n\nThis function accepts any string as input, so you can pass it the contents of a markdown file or a markdown string. It returns a string containing the extracted Julia code blocks joined together with a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document contains valid markdown syntax and that the Julia code blocks are correctly fenced with `` ```julia `` and `` ``` ``. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.\n\nAlso, this function does not modify the original markdown string. It creates a new string with the extracted code blocks and returns it.\n\nThe function uses the `AbstractString` type annotation for the input and output parameters to allow any string type (e.g., `String`, `SubString`, etc.) to be used as input. The function also uses generic type annotations (e.g., `AbstractString` instead of `String`) to be more flexible and allow subtypes of the base type to be used.\n\nFinally, this function uses the `Markdown` package, which is a standard library in Julia. No additional packages are required.","status":200,"tokens":[391,625],"elapsed":6.937779583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1240768429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
