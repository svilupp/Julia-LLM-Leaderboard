[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Define a regular expression `code_block_regex` to match Julia code blocks. The regular expression uses the `s` flag for dotall mode (i.e., `.` matches newlines) and the `i` flag for case insensitivity.\n2. Find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown string using the `eachmatch` function.\n3. Initialize an empty string `code` to store the extracted code.\n4. Loop through all the matches using a `for` loop.\n5. For each match, remove the code fences using string slicing, and join the code lines with a newline using the `join` function with an asterisk operator (`*=`) for concatenation.\n6. Return the extracted code as a string.\n\nThe function takes in a markdown string as an argument and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code. The function uses Julia's regular expression and string manipulation capabilities to extract the code blocks and remove the code fences. The function is written with performance, clarity, and abstract types in mind.","status":200,"tokens":[391,479],"elapsed":7.77507825,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1732334747,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
