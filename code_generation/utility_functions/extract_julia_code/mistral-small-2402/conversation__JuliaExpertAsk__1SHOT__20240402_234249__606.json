Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> x isa CodeBlock && occursin(\"julia\", x.meta), doc.blocks)\n    code_string = join([strip(x.text) for x in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n    return code_string\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse the input markdown string. It then filters out the code blocks that have a \"julia\" language identifier in their metadata. It removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the code text and joins all the code blocks together with two newlines between them. The result is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[125,202],"elapsed":5.055680792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":556878313,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
