[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_re = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown string\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_re, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the matches\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the code fences and join the code lines with a newline\n        code = replace(match[1], r\"```julia\\n|```\"m, \"\")\n\n        # Append the extracted code to the result string with a newline\n        extracted_code *= code * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    # Trim any leading or trailing newlines from the result string\n    return chomp(extracted_code)\nend\n```\nThe function takes a markdown string as input, uses a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks, removes the code fences, joins the code lines with a newline, and returns the extracted code as a string.\n\nThe regular expression used to match Julia code blocks is ` ```julia\\n(.*?)``` `, which matches three backticks followed by the word \"julia\", a newline, any number of characters (captured in a group), and three backticks again. The `s` flag is used to make the dot character match newlines, and the `m` flag is used to make the caret and dollar characters match the beginning and end of lines, respectively.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the markdown string, and the `replace` function is used to remove the code fences and join the code lines with a newline. The `chomp` function is used to remove any leading or trailing newlines from the result string.\n\nThis solution does not use any external packages and relies only on the standard library of Julia. It should work for any markdown document containing Julia code blocks, as long as they are fenced with three backticks and the language identifier \"julia\".","status":200,"tokens":[391,524],"elapsed":6.104733375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1652779368,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
