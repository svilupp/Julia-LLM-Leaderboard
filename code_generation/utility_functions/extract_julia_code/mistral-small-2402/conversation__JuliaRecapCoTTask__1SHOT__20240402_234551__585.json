[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\nWe will use the `Regex` module to find code blocks in markdown, the `replace` function to remove code fences, and the `join` function to combine multiple code blocks.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Find all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks\n    extracted_code = join(replace.(code_blocks, r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\"), \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, you can test it with sample markdown documents containing Julia code blocks and print out the extracted code to verify that it matches the original code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[393,259],"elapsed":3.01092925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1745844002,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
