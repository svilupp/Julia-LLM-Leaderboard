[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_block_start = 0\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            code_block_start = i\n        elseif in_code_block && startswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, join(lines[code_block_start+1:i-1], \"\\n\"))\n            in_code_block = false\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If there's an open code block at the end of the document\n    if in_code_block\n        push!(code_blocks, join(lines[code_block_start+1:end], \"\\n\"))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the lines of the markdown document. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag `in_code_block` to true and remembers the line number. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" while `in_code_block` is true, it adds the code block (from the start line to the end line, excluding the fences) to the `code_blocks` array, and sets `in_code_block` to false. After processing all the lines, it joins all the code blocks together with a double newline.\n\nThe function assumes that the markdown document is given as a single string. If it's given in another format (e.g., as an array of strings), you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[391,455],"elapsed":5.198341417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-467418220,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
