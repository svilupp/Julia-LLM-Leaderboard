It loops through each node in the parsed document, checks if the node is a code block with the language \"julia\", and if so, removes the code fences and adds the code to a string. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a single string with newlines between the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[84,276],"elapsed":6.882807208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":372894173,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
