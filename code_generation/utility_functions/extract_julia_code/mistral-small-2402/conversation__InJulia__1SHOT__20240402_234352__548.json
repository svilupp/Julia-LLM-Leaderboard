It then iterates through all the blocks in the parsed document, checks if the block is a code block, and if the language is Julia, it pushes the content of the code block to an array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a double newline character and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,243],"elapsed":2.652746083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":60945623,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
