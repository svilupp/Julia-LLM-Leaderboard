It then joins the code blocks together with a newline character and removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each block. The resulting string is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all code blocks are correctly formatted with three backticks (```) and the language name (\"julia\"). If the code blocks have a different format, the function may need to be modified to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[84,301],"elapsed":3.428143333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1967200404,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
