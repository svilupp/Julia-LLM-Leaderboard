Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that should accomplish the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = filter(x -> occursin(\"```julia\", x) && occursin(\"```\", x), split(md, \"```\"))\n    code_blocks = map(x -> replace(x, \"```\" => \"\"), blocks)\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown string on `\"```\"` to separate the code blocks. It then filters out any blocks that don't have both \"```julia\" and \"```\", ensuring we're only looking at Julia code blocks. The `map` function is used to remove the code fences from the remaining blocks. Finally, `join` is used to combine all the code blocks into a single string, separated by two newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[125,212],"elapsed":2.385471084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-36907701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
