[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that extracts all Julia code blocks from a markdown document and joins them together with a newline.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    for node in doc\n        if node isa CodeBlock\n            language = get(node.meta, \"language\", \"\")\n            if lowercase(language) == \"julia\"\n                push!(julia_code_blocks, node.text)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document, then iterates over the nodes. If a node is a `CodeBlock` and its language is \"julia\", it appends the code block to an array of Julia code blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with two newlines in between and returns the result.\n\nThe function takes an `AbstractString` as input, which means it can handle both `String` and `SubString` (a contiguous subsequence of a string). It returns a `String` containing the extracted Julia code.\n\nPlease note that the `Markdown` package is a standard library in Julia, so there's no need to install an external package.\n\nThe `CodeBlock` type represents a code block in the markdown document. Its `meta` field is a dictionary that contains metadata about the code block, including the language. The `text` field contains the actual code.\n\nThe `get(node.meta, \"language\", \"\")` expression retrieves the value associated with the \"language\" key from the `meta` dictionary, or an empty string if the key is not present.\n\nThe `join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")` expression joins the elements of the `julia_code_blocks` array into a single string, with two newlines in between each element.\n\nThe `parse_markdown(md)` function parses a markdown document and returns a tree of nodes representing the document structure.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown document is correctly formatted and that all Julia code blocks are correctly marked with the \"julia\" language. It does not perform any error checking or validation.\n\nThe function does not modify the input markdown document. It creates a new string with the extracted Julia code and returns it.\n\nThe function uses multiple dispatch, which is a distinctive feature of Julia. The `parse_markdown` function is generic and can parse markdown documents represented as various string types. The `extract_julia_code` function is also generic and can handle various string types as input.\n\nThe function does not use any global variables or modify any global state. It is a pure function, which means it always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects.","status":200,"tokens":[393,672],"elapsed":7.309419917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1323624214,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
