It reads the markdown string character by character, and if it finds a code fence, it starts or stops extracting the code. When it finds a newline within a code block, it pushes the current code string to a codes array and starts a new one. Finally, it joins all the code strings with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[125,437],"elapsed":10.703726208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1645379248,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
