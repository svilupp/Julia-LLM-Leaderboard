It then iterates through the elements of the parsed document and checks if each element is a code block written in Julia. If it is, it removes the code fences and appends the code to a string. Finally, it returns the string containing all the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[84,293],"elapsed":3.18144525,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-521019609,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
