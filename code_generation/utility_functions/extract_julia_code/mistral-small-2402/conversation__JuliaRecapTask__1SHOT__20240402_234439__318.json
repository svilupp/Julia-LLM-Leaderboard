[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n  # Parse the markdown document\n  ast = parse(Markdown.Parser, md)\n\n  # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n  code = \"\"\n\n  # Iterate through the nodes in the AST\n  for node in ast\n    # Check if the node is a code block\n    if node isa Markdown.CodeBlock\n      # Check if the code block is fenced and the info string starts with \"```julia\"\n      if !isempty(node.info) && startswith(node.info, \"```julia\")\n        # Extract the code from the node and append it to the code string, with a newline\n        code *= string(node.text) * \"\\n\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Return the extracted code string\n  return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` standard library to parse the input markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It then iterates through the nodes in the AST and checks if each node is a code block. If the code block is fenced and the info string starts with \"```julia\", it extracts the code from the node and appends it to a string called `code`. Finally, it returns the `code` string as the result.\n\nTo ensure that the function works correctly, you can test it with some sample markdown documents containing Julia code blocks. You can also add error checking and validation code to handle edge cases and malformed input.","status":200,"tokens":[391,381],"elapsed":4.502609667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":573925404,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
