[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided problem, here's a possible solution using the Julia programming language. This solution uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract the Julia code blocks.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n\n    for node in doc\n        if typeof(node) <: Markdown.CodeBlock\n            language = get(node.meta, \"language\", \"\")\n            if lowercase(language) == \"julia\"\n                push!(julia_code_blocks, node.text)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It uses the `parse_markdown` function from the `Markdown` package to parse the input markdown string into a tree of nodes representing the markdown document.\n2. It then iterates over each node in the tree. If a node is a code block (i.e., `typeof(node) <: Markdown.CodeBlock`), it checks if the language of the code block is Julia (i.e., `lowercase(language) == \"julia\"`).\n3. If the code block is written in Julia, it adds the code to an array of Julia code blocks.\n4. Finally, it joins all the Julia code blocks together with two newline characters and returns the result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input markdown string is valid and can be parsed by the `parse_markdown` function. If the input string is not valid markdown, this function may throw an error.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `Markdown` package, which is a standard library in Julia. It does not require any additional packages to be installed.\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`, which is the markdown document from which to extract the Julia code blocks. It returns a string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks, joined together with two newline characters.\n\nI hope this helps!
