It then extracts the code from each code block and joins them together with a double newline (`\\n\\n`) to separate the different code blocks in the returned string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,246],"elapsed":6.193204791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":483317855,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
