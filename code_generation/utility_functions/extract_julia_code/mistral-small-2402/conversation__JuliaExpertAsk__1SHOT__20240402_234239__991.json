Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to extract Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex for Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n\n    # Find all code blocks and join them\n    code_blocks = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    extracted_code = join(map(m -> replace(m[1], r\"^```julia\\n|```$\", \"\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown document as a string and uses a regex to find all Julia code blocks (with triple backticks and \"julia\" as the language identifier).

Finally, it returns the extracted Julia code as a string.\n\nYou can copy and paste this function into your Julia environment or script.","status":200,"tokens":[125,249],"elapsed":2.713400667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-63807103,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
