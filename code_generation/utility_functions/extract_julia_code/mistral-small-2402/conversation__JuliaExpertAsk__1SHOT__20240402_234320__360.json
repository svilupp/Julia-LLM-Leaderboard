Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    doc = parse_markdown(md)\n    julia_codes = String[]\n    for node in doc.content\n        if node isa CodeBlock && node.lang == \"julia\"\n            push!(julia_codes, node.content)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(julia_codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the given markdown string into a Markdown.Parsed object using the `parse_markdown` function from the Markdown package. It then iterates over each node in the parsed document. If a node is a CodeBlock with language \"julia\", it appends the content of the code block to an array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[125,229],"elapsed":2.602584667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1768096702,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
