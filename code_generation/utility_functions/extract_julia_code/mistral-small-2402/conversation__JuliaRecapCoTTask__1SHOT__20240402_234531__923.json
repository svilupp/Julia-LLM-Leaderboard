[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the special instructions, I will create a function `extract_julia_code` that uses Julia's standard libraries to parse and extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document. Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    doc = parse(Markdown.Parser, md)\n    code_blocks = Markdown.CodeBlock[]\n\n    # Collect all Julia code blocks\n    for node in doc.content\n        if node isa Markdown.CodeBlock\n            language = get(node.meta, \"language\", nothing)\n            if language == \"julia\"\n                push!(code_blocks, node)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join and remove code fences from the code blocks\n    code_string = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        code_string *= string(block.content) * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return code_string\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`, which is the markdown document containing code blocks. The function uses Julia's `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract the Julia code blocks.\n\nThe function first creates a `Markdown.Document` object from the provided markdown string. It then iterates through the `doc.content` field, which contains a list of parsed nodes, and collects all code blocks with language `\"julia\"`. After collecting all code blocks, the function concatenates them together with a newline character and removes any code fences.\n\nFinally, the function returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.\n\nPlease make sure to install the `Markdown` package before using the function. You can do this by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")` in your Julia REPL.\n\nThe function does not include any error handling or input validation. It is your responsibility to ensure that the provided markdown string contains valid markdown syntax and that the Julia code blocks are properly formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[393,467],"elapsed":5.135787709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1640053997,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
