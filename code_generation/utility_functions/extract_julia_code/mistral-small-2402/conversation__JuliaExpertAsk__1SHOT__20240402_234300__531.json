The function first iterates through the input string and extracts all the code blocks. Then it filters out the non-Julia code blocks and joins the remaining Julia code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[125,423],"elapsed":5.85952975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1440400870,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
