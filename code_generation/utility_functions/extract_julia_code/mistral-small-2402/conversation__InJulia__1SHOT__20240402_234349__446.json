Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    ast = parse(Markdown.Parser, md)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    function collect_code(node::Union{Markdown.CodeBlock, Markdown.FencedCodeBlock})\n        push!(code_blocks, String(node.text) |> strip)\n    end\n    walk(ast, collect_code)\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first parsing the markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It then defines a callback function `collect_code` that is called for each `CodeBlock` and `FencedCodeBlock` node in the AST. This function pushes the text of the code block, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, onto an array. After the AST has been walked, the function returns the code blocks joined together with a double newline.","status":200,"tokens":[84,256],"elapsed":4.027551708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":598658436,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
