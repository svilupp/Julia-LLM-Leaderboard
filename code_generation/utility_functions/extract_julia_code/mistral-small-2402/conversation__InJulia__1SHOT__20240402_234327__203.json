It then checks if the language of the code block is Julia by comparing the `lang` field of the `CodeBlock` struct. If it is, it removes the code fences by calling the `strip` function on each line of the code and joining them together with a newline. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,314],"elapsed":3.468299416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1145779023,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
