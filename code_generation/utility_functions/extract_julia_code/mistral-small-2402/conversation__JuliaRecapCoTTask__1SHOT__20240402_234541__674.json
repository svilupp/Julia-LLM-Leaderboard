[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia that extracts all the code blocks from a markdown document and joins them together with a newline:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n  blocks = parse(Markdown.Document, md).content\n  code_blocks = filter(!isempty, [block.text for block in blocks if Markdown.iscode(block)])\n  return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nHere is a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The `parse` function from the `Markdown` standard library is used to parse the input markdown string into a `Markdown.Document` object.\n2. The `content` field of the `Markdown.Document` object contains a vector of `Markdown.Block` objects that represent the different elements of the markdown document.\n3. The `filter` function is used to extract only the code blocks from the `content` vector. A block is considered a code block if its `Markdown.iscode` method returns `true`.\n4. The `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string, with each code block separated by a newline character.\n\nThe function takes a single argument `md`, which is an abstract string containing the markdown document, and returns an abstract string containing the extracted Julia code. The function uses the `Markdown` standard library, so there is no need to install any additional packages. The function is type annotated to make it clear what types of input and output it expects, and to improve performance and clarity. The function uses multiple dispatch on the `AbstractString` type to make it more general and flexible.","status":200,"tokens":[393,394],"elapsed":4.476960583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":890198199,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
