[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    md_doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    code_blocks = [block.content for block in md_doc if block isa Markdown.CodeBlock]\n    code_blocks = filter(!isempty, code_blocks)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> occursin(\"```julia\", x) && occursin(\"```\", x), code_blocks)\n    code_strings = [strip(replace(block, \"```\" => \"\")) for block in code_blocks]\n    return join(code_strings, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function takes an `AbstractString` as input, which represents the markdown document. It first parses the markdown document using the `Markdown.parse` function from the Markdown.jl standard library, which returns a parsed `Markdown.Document`.\n\nThe function then extracts all the code blocks in the document using list comprehension and filters out any empty code blocks. It then filters out any code blocks that do not have the correct code fence for Julia (i.e., \"```julia\" and \"```\").\n\nThe function then removes the code fences from the remaining code blocks using the `replace` function and joins them together with a newline using the `join` function. Finally, it returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that the `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the code blocks.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the markdown document has been correctly formatted with the correct code fences for Julia. If the markdown document is not formatted correctly, the function may return unexpected results.\n\nAlso note that this implementation uses the Markdown.jl standard library, which is part of Julia's standard library. It does not require any additional packages.\n\nThe function uses general type annotations (i.e., `AbstractString`) to ensure that it can handle any type of string that can be converted to a markdown document. It also emphasizes clarity and performance by using list comprehension and filtering to extract and process the code blocks.\n\nFinally, the function uses multiple dispatch on the `Markdown.CodeBlock` type to filter out any non-code blocks from the parsed document. This allows the function to handle any type of markdown document, regardless of its contents or structure.","status":200,"tokens":[391,558],"elapsed":9.200185917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":141097040,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
