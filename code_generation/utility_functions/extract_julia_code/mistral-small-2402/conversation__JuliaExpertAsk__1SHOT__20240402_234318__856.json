It then walks through the parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), looking for code blocks with the language specified as \"julia\", and collects their contents into a string array. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with double newlines and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[125,247],"elapsed":3.615550917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-67464195,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
