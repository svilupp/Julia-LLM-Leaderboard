The function returns the extracted Julia code as a string. Please note that you need to have the `Markdown.jl` package installed in your Julia environment for this function to work. You can install it using the `Pkg` manager in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[84,228],"elapsed":2.49775625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1339587602,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
