[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It uses a simple state machine to keep track of whether it is currently inside a code block or not. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag indicating that it is inside a code block. It then continues to accumulate lines in a `code_blocks` array until it encounters a line that starts with \"```\", at which point it joins all the accumulated lines together with newlines, pushes the result to the `code_blocks` array, and resets the flag. Finally, it joins all the accumulated code blocks together with newlines and returns the result.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\nHere is some markdown text with a Julia code block:\n\n```julia\nfunction greet(name)\n    println(\"Hello, $(name)!\")\nend\n```\n\nHere is some more markdown text with another code block:\n\n```julia\ngreet(\"Alice\")\ngreet(\"Bob\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(code)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nfunction greet(name)\n    println(\"Hello, $(name)!\")\nend\n\ngreet(\"Alice\")\ngreet(\"Bob\")\n```\nNote that the code fences (i.e., the \"```\" characters) have been removed and the code blocks have been joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[391,613],"elapsed":6.9587395,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2055762359,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
