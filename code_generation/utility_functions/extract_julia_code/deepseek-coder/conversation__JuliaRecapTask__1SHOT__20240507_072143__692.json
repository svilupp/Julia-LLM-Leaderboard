[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that extracts Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_lines = String[]\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over each line. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside a Julia code block. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" and the flag is set, it unsets the flag. When the flag is set, it adds the line to a list of code lines. Finally, it joins all the code lines together with newlines and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[417,275],"elapsed":10.722325709,"cost":0.00013538,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1230481613,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
