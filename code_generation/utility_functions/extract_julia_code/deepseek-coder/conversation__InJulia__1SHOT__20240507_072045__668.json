[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that does exactly what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into lines, then iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside a code block. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" and the flag is set, it unsets the flag. If the flag is set, it adds the line to a list of code blocks. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newlines and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[90,277],"elapsed":10.738395166,"cost":9.016000000000002e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":614903661,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
