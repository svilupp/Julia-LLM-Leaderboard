Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize a flag to indicate whether we are inside a code block\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # If the line starts with \"```julia\" or \"```jl\", we are entering a code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```jl\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If the line is \"```\", we are exiting a code block\n        if line == \"```\"\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we are inside a code block, add the line to the code\n        if in_code_block\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the code\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\" or \"```jl\", it sets a flag indicating that it is inside a code block. If it encounters a line that is just \"```\", it sets the flag to false, indicating that it is no longer inside a code block. If it is inside a code block, it adds the line to the code string. Finally, it returns the code string.","status":200,"tokens":[131,391],"elapsed":14.127460583,"cost":0.00012782,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1448257087,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
