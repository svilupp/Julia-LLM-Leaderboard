Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"```julia\") && endswith(x, \"```\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    code = join(map(x -> replace(x, r\"```julia|```\" => \"\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown document into lines, then filtering out the lines that do not contain a Julia code block. It then removes the code fences from each of these lines and joins them together with a newline. The result is a string containing all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[131,180],"elapsed":8.556139667,"cost":6.874000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1847461647,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
