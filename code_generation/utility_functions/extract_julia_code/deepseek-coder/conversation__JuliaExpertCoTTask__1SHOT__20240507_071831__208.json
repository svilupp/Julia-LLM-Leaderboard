[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize a flag to indicate whether we are inside a Julia code block\n    in_julia_block = false\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # If we find a line that starts with \"```julia\", we are inside a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we find a line that starts with \"```\", we are no longer inside a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we are inside a Julia code block, add the line to the code\n        if in_julia_block\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over the lines. When it finds a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets a flag to indicate that it is inside a Julia code block. When it finds a line that starts with \"```\", it sets the flag to indicate that it is no longer inside a Julia code block. When it is inside a Julia code block, it adds the line to the code.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed, i.e., that every code block starts with \"```julia\" and ends with \"```\". If the markdown document is not well-formed, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[224,438],"elapsed":20.672068791,"cost":0.000154,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1956034585,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
