[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When it finds a Julia code block, it appends the lines to the `code` string. The `in_julia_block` flag is used to keep track of whether we are currently inside a Julia code block.","status":200,"tokens":[224,350],"elapsed":13.868019375,"cost":0.00012936000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1326028890,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
