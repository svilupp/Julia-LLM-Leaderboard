Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize a flag to indicate whether we are inside a code block\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with \"```julia\"\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # If we are not in a code block, we are now\n            if !in_code_block\n                in_code_block = true\n            # If we are in a code block, we are no longer\n            else\n                in_code_block = false\n                # Add a newline to the code\n                code *= '\\n'\n            end\n        # If we are in a code block, add the line to the code\n        elseif in_code_block\n            code *= line * '\\n'\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the code\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over each line. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it toggles a flag indicating whether we are inside a code block. If we are inside a code block, the line is added to the code. If we are not inside a code block, the line is ignored. The code is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[131,366],"elapsed":15.487520708,"cost":0.00012082000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1533198420,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
