The `replace` function is used with regular expressions (regex) to match the patterns. The `r` before the string indicates that it is a raw string, which treats backslashes as literal characters.","status":200,"tokens":[224,143],"elapsed":6.7190665,"cost":7.14e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-292713370,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
