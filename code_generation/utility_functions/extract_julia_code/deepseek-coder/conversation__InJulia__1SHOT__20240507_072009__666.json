When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\" or \"```jl\", it sets a flag to indicate that it is inside a code block. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```\", it sets the flag to indicate that it is no longer inside a code block. While it is inside a code block, it adds the line to a string that stores the code. When it is done iterating over all the lines, it returns the code.","status":200,"tokens":[90,402],"elapsed":16.363496333,"cost":0.00012516,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-507859946,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
