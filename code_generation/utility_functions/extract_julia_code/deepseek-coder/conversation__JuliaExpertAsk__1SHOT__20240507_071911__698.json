Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize a flag to indicate whether we're inside a code block\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with a code fence\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # If we're not already inside a code block, set the flag and continue\n            if !in_code_block\n                in_code_block = true\n                continue\n            else\n                # If we are already inside a code block, we've reached the end of the block\n                break\n            end\n        end\n\n        # If we're inside a code block, add the line to the code string\n        if in_code_block\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines, then iterating over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with ````julia`, it toggles a flag indicating whether it's inside a code block. If it's inside a code block, it adds the line to a string holding the extracted code. When it encounters a line that starts with ````julia` again, it breaks out of the loop, assuming that the code block has ended. Finally, it returns the extracted code.","status":200,"tokens":[131,390],"elapsed":16.643672417,"cost":0.00012754000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":201160103,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
