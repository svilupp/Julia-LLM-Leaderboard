[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how we can systematically solve this problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output Formats\n- **Input**: A markdown string that may have code blocks in various languages. We are particularly interested in code blocks that start with triple backticks followed by the language indicator \"julia\" (e.g., ```julia) and end with triple backticks.\n- **Output**: A string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks concatenated together, separated by a newline.\n\n### Step 2: Parse the Markdown to Identify Julia Code Blocks\n- We'll scan through the markdown string searching for \"```julia\" to identify the start and \"```\" for the end of a Julia code block.\n- We have to remove the \"```julia\" and \"```\" from the extracted code.\n- Accumulate these code blocks into a list.\n\n### Step 3: Join the Extracted Code Blocks\n- Use `join(..., \"\\n\")` to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string, separated by newlines.\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Function\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = String[]  # Accumulate extracted code blocks here\n    in_code_block = false  # Track whether we are inside a julia code block\n    current_block = IOBuffer()  # Temporary buffer for the current code block\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")  # Check if it's a code fence\n            # Check if starting a julia code block\n            if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n                in_code_block = true\n                current_block = IOBuffer()  # Start a new buffer for the block\n            elseif in_code_block  # We are closing an active julia code block\n                in_code_block = false\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))  # Save the block\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block\n            # If we are inside a julia code block, capture the line\n            println(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline between them\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Function\n\nWe should consider test cases, such as:\n- Markdown documents with no code blocks.\n- Markdown documents with multiple Julia code blocks.\n- Documents with other languages' code blocks mixed in.\n- Nested code blocksâ€”though markdown doesn't support nesting code blocks, checking robustness.\n\nThis function efficiently extracts the Julia code blocks by going through the document line-by-line, making sure only valid Julia code is included in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[338,557],"elapsed":5.911490709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1537542965,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
