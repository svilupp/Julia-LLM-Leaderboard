[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, I'll proceed systematically as follows:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**:\n    - In markdown, code blocks are typically wrapped by triple backticks \\(```\\) or tildes (\\~~~\\).\n    - We are interested in those that specify the \"julia\" language after the opening fence, i.e., \\(```julia\\).\n\n2. **Extract the Code**:\n    - For each code block that starts with \\(```julia\\), extract the text until the closing fence \\(```\\).\n  \n3. **Join Code Blocks**:\n    - If there are multiple code blocks, join them with a newline.\n\n4. **Return the Combined Code**:\n    - Return the extracted and concatenated code as a string.\n\nHereâ€™s the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    julia_blocks = match(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, all=true, s=true)\n\n    # Extract the code from matched blocks and join them with a newline\n    if julia_blocks !== nothing\n        # Remove the code fences and join\n        codes = [block.match[2] for block in julia_blocks]\n        return join(codes, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return \"\"  # Return an empty string if no Julia code block is found\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regex Matching**:\n    - The `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"` pattern looks for sections starting with ```julia and ending with ``` (the `s=true` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters).\n    - The `match` function with `all=true` returns all these blocks if multiple occur.\n\n2. **Code Extraction**:\n    - The captured group `block.match[2]` holds the content of the code block minus the triple backticks.\n    - A list comprehension is used to extract code from all matched blocks.\n\n3. **Result Concatenation**:\n    - The `join(codes, \"\\n\")` concatenates all extracted blocks with newline characters between them.\n\n4. **Edge Case**:\n    - If no Julia code blocks are found, the function returns an empty string `\"\"`.\n\n### Double-Check\n- The function should work for documents with no code blocks, one code block, or multiple Julia code blocks.\n- Ensure that extraneous whitespace or lack of proper markdown formatting doesn't affect the parsing.\n\nThe function is now ready to be used for extracting Julia code from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[337,553],"elapsed":5.812258458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1535635635,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
