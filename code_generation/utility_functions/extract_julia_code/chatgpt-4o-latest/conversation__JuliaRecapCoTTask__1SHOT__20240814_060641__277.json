[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will:\n1. Identify the Julia language code blocks in the markdown document.\n2. Extract the content of each code block. \n3. Join the contents if there are multiple blocks, separated by a newline.\n4. Return the final combined string.\n\nThe steps to achieve this involve:\n- Searching for lines in the markdown that start with triple backticks followed by `julia` (which denotes the start of a Julia code block).\n- Collecting all lines until the ending triple backticks (` ``` `) is encountered.\n- Removing the code fences and joining the contents of the potentially multiple code blocks.\n\nHere is the implementation of the required function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    inside_block = false\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") && !inside_block\n            inside_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && inside_block\n            inside_block = false\n            append!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n        elseif inside_block\n            println(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`starts_with` check**: We check whether a line starts with the needed code block fence strings (` ```julia ` or ` ``` `).\n2. **Conditional Handling**:\n   - If we detect the start of a block (` ```julia `), we begin recording within the block.\n   - If we detect the end of a block (` ``` `), we stop recording and store the accumulated code.\n   - All lines between these are added to an IOBuffer for the ongoing code block.\n3. **Concatenation**:\n   - After all code blocks are extracted, they are joined with newlines.\n4. **Return**: The final aggregated string is returned.\n\nThis function effectively handles multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown, removing the code fences and joining them appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[338,432],"elapsed":4.7827465,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1606375126,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
