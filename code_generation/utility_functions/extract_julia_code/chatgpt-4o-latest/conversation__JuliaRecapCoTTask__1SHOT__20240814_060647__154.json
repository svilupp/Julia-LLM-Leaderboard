[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Alright, let's break down the task and devise a solution in Julia.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. **Identify all Code Blocks**: \n   - Julia code blocks in markdown are typically enclosed with triple backticks ` ```julia ` at the beginning and end (` ``` `). These are often referred to as code fences.\n   \n2. **Extract Code**:\n   - Identify the lines between the opening ` ```julia ` and closing ` ``` ` to extract the code.\n   \n3. **Remove the Fences**:\n   - Once a code block is identified, the lines with ` ``` ` should be excluded.\n   \n4. **Join Code Blocks**:\n   - If there are multiple code blocks in the document, they should be concatenated with a newline between them.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the final extracted code as a single string.\n\n### Solution Implementation in Julia:\n\nLet's implement a function `extract_julia_code` that adheres to these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    in_code_block = false\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block && occursin(\"```\", line)\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_code_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`in_code_block`**: A boolean flag to track whether we're inside a Julia code block.\n- **`julia_code_blocks`**: An array to store lines of extracted Julia code.\n- **`split(md, \"\\n\")`**: Split the markdown content by lines for easy processing.\n- **Loop through each line**:\n  - **Start of the block**: When encountering a \"```julia\", set the flag `in_code_block` to `true`.\n  - **End of the block**: When encountering \"```\", set `in_code_block` to `false`.\n  - **Collect lines**: If `in_code_block` is `true`, capture the lines inside the block.\n- **Finally, `join` the collected code lines**: Joined with a newline separator.\n\n### Double-Checking:\n- The implementation carefully identifies and processes only Julia code blocks, ignoring non-Julia code.\n- It correctly removes both opening and closing code fences.\n- If found, multiple Julia code blocks will be joined with newline characters.\n\nThe function should now be ready to perform its task on any given markdown string, conforming to the described requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[338,569],"elapsed":6.020372333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":22540661,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
