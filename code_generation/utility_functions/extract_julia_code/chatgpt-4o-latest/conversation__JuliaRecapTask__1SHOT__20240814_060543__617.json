[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's solve the task step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Julia Code Blocks\nIn markdown documents, code blocks are typically denoted with triple backticks (\"```\"). To identify Julia-specific code blocks, the language designation inside the backticks, such as `julia`, can be checked.\n\n### Step 2: Extract the Code Inside the Blocks\nOnce a Julia block is identified, the lines between the triple backticks should be extracted.\n\n### Step 3: Handle Multiple Blocks\nIf there are multiple Julia code blocks, join them together with a newline.\n\n### Step 4: String Manipulation\nRemove the backticks and the language designation and just keep the code. Also, append a single newline between consecutive code blocks.\n\n### Step 5: Implement the Solution\n\nLet's implement this in the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    in_code_block = false\n    extracted_code = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_code_block\n                in_code_block = false\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(extracted_code, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(extracted_code, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **in_code_block:** A boolean flag that indicates if the parser is inside a Julia code block.\n- **extracted_code:** An array to store the lines of code that belong to Julia code blocks.\n- **for loop:** Iterates over each line in the markdown document.\n  - If it finds a line starting with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to true.\n  - If it hits a line with \"```\", it checks if we are in a Julia code block and sets `in_code_block` to false.\n  - If inside a Julia code block, the lines are pushed into the `extracted_code` array.\n- **join:** Joins all lines in `extracted_code` with newline characters to form the full extracted code.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Function\n- It's crucial to make sure that the function correctly handles both single and multiple code blocks.\n- Edge cases should also be considered, such as an empty document, no Julia code blocks, and mixed language code blocks.\n\nThe function is now completed and ready for use.","status":200,"tokens":[337,514],"elapsed":5.848069208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":719451630,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
