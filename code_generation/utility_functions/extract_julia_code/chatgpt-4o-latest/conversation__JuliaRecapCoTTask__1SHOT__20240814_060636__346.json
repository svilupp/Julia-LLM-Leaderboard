[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, here are the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Julia Code Blocks\n- Markdown code fences start and end with triple backticks `` ``` ``.\n- Julia code blocks are specifically identified by the language tag `julia` following the opening backticks.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Julia Code Blocks\n- We'll loop through the lines in the markdown document to find the start and end of Julia code blocks.\n- Once a Julia code block is identified, we'll extract the lines within it (excluding the fences).\n\n### Step 3: Join the Extracted Code Blocks\n- If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we'll join them with a newline.\n\n### Step 4: Return the Result as a String\n\n### Implementation\nLet's implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Splitting lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    inside_code_block = false\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") && !inside_code_block\n            inside_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && inside_code_block\n            inside_code_block = false\n        elseif inside_code_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Combine the extracted code blocks into a single string with newlines between blocks\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Line Splitting:**\n   - The document is split into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n\n2. **Identifying and Extracting Julia Code Blocks:**\n   - We initialize `inside_code_block` as `false` to track when we are within a Julia code block.\n   - The loop iterates over each line; if a line starts with `` ```julia ``, we know we've entered a Julia code block, so we set `inside_code_block` to `true`.\n   - Conversely, if a line starts with `` ``` `` and weâ€™re inside a code block, we know the block has ended, so we set `inside_code_block` to `false`.\n   - Lines inside a Julia code block are appended to `julia_code_blocks`.\n\n3. **Joining and Returning the Result:**\n   - We join all the captured Julia code blocks using `join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function should handle any markdown document `md` and correctly extract, clean, and concatenate all Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[338,541],"elapsed":5.89843325,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":158123460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
