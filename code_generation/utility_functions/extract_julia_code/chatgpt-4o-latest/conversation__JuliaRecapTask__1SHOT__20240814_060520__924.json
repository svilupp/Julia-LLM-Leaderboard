[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets That Will Be Useful\n- We will use Julia's standard string manipulation functions to process the markdown and extract the code blocks.\n- Functions like `occursin`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `split`, and `join` will be helpful.\n- Regular expressions will help in matching the start and end of code fences.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe can systematically break down the task as follows:\n1. Split the document by lines.\n2. Detect the starting and ending of Julia code blocks by looking for triple backticks with the `julia` identifier.\n3. Extract the code inside the detected blocks.\n4. Join all the extracted code blocks together using a newline.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the document by lines\n    is_inside_block = false  # Flag to detect if we're inside a code block\n\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]  # To store individual julia code blocks\n    current_block = String[]      # To store a single code block\n\n    for line in lines\n        if is_inside_block\n            if startswith(line, \"```\")\n                is_inside_block = false  # End of a code block\n                push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, '\\n'))\n                empty!(current_block)  # Reset for the next block\n            else\n                push!(current_block, line)\n            end\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            is_inside_block = true  # Beginning of a julia code block\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n\n1. **Boundary Cases**:\n    - Markdown with no code blocks: The function should return an empty string.\n    - Markdown with only one code block: The function should return the content of that block unaltered.\n    - Markdown with multiple blocks: The function should correctly concatenate them with newline characters.\n    - Non-Julia code blocks should be ignored.\n\n2. **Correctness**:\n    - Ensure `is_inside_block` correctly manages transitions between code blocks.\n    - Be certain that the start and end of blocks are processed correctly with `startswith(line, \"```julia\")` and `startswith(line, \"```\")`.\n\nThe solution should meet the requirements.\n\nThis function will correctly extract all Julia code blocks from a Markdown string and join them together into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[337,533],"elapsed":5.607277542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2091695256,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
