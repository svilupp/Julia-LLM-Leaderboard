X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we'll systematically go through the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify and Extract Code Blocks\nWe need to identify the Julia code blocks in the Markdown document. In Markdown, code blocks are denoted by triple backticks ```` ``` ```` and the language name directly follows the opening backticks (e.g., ```` ```julia ````).\n\n### Step 2: Remove Code Fences\nOnce we have identified the code blocks, we will extract only the code part and ignore the ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ```` backticks.\n\n### Step 3: Join Multiple Code Blocks\nIf there are multiple Julia code blocks, we will concatenate them into a single string with newlines separating individual blocks.\n\n### Step 4: Return the Result\nFinally, we will return the concatenated string as the output.\n\nHere's how that process can be implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    in_code_block = false\n    extracted_code = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(extracted_code, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(extracted_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We first initialize `in_code_block` as `false`. This boolean variable will allow us to detect when we are inside a Julia code block.\n- We split the input markdown string `md` by newline characters to process it line by line.\n- If a line starts with ```` ```julia ```` we know a Julia code block is starting, so we set `in_code_block = true`.\n- If we encounter a line that starts with ```` ``` ```` and `in_code_block` is `true`, it signals the end of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block = false`.\n- If we are `in_code_block`, we add the current line to our `extracted_code` array.\n- After processing all lines, we join everything in `extracted_code` with newlines and return a single concatenated string.\n\n### Step 5: Double-check the Solution\nThe function should correctly handle edge cases, such as:\n- Nested code blocks (which are invalid in Markdown but may occur).\n- Markdown documents without any Julia code blocks should return an empty string.\n- Multiple and disjoint Julia code blocks are correctly joined.\n\nThis solution follows the systematic approach outlined and should meet the requirements of the task.","status":200,"tokens":[337,553],"elapsed":5.680956167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1883648896,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
