[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\nTo solve this problem, the key steps are:\n- Parse the text and identify code blocks related to Julia.\n- Remove the code fences (triple backticks and language identifier).\n- Collect the content inside the Julia blocks.\n- Join all the blocks with newlines and return as a single string.\n\nUseful functions:\n- `split` to break the document into segments based on triple backticks.\n- Loop through the segments to check for Julia language code blocks.\n- `strip` to remove any unwanted whitespace or backticks.\n- `join` to concatenate multiple strings with a specified delimiter (in this case, a newline `\\n`).\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nNow, I'll implement the `extract_julia_code` function step-by-step.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split the document by triple backticks\n    sections = split(md, \"```\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty array to collect Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over the sections. We skip every second section (text sections).\n    for i in 2:2:length(sections)\n        # Check if the first line specifies that it's a julia code block\n        if startswith(strip(sections[i]), \"julia\")\n            # Remove the initial julia specification line\n            code = join(split(sections[i], \"\\n\")[2:end], \"\\n\")\n            # Strip the code and add to our list\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, code)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all collected Julia blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\n- **Input:** The function expects a markdown string `md`.\n- **Output:** The function returns a string containing all Julia code blocks concatenated with newlines in between.\n- **Check Edge Cases:**\n  - If there are no Julia code blocks, the function should return an empty string.\n  - If there is one Julia block, it should return that block without any enclosing backticks or additional content.\n  - Multiple Julia blocks should be concatenated correctly with precisely one newline in between.\n\nThis implementation seems correct based on the logic described, but testing it in different scenarios would be advisable in a real case.\n\nThe function efficiently handles extracting and concatenating valid Julia code from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[337,509],"elapsed":5.650074208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":536466004,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
