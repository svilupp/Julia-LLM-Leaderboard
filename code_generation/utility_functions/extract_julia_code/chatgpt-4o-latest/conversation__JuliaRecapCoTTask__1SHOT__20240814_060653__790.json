[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To handle the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can approach it systematically by following these steps:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task:\n1. Identify the Julia code blocks within the markdown content. These are typically enclosed by triple backticks (```) with `julia` specified immediately after the opening backticks.\n2. Extract the code between these backticks.\n3. Remove the fences (the backticks and `julia` keyword).\n4. Join all the extracted code blocks together with a newline.\n5. Return the combined string.\n\n### Julia Snippets Useful for the Task:\n- **Regular expressions**:\n  - `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s` to match Julia code blocks with non-greedy matching (using `s` flag to allow `.` to match newline).\n- **String functions**:\n  - `replace` to remove the fences.\n  - `split` and `join` to manage and concatenate multiple blocks of Julia code.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Use a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks\n    julia_blocks = collect(m.match for m in eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s, md))\n    \n    # Remove the markdown fences and join the blocks\n    joined_code = join([replace(block, r\"^```julia\\s*|\\s*```$\"m => \"\") for block in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check:\n1. **Regular Expression Check**: The regex `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s` effectively locates Julia code blocks enclosed within triple backticks.\n2. **Fence Removal**: The `replace` function removes both the opening ` ```julia ` and the closing ` ``` `.\n3. **Joining**: The code blocks are joined together with a newline.\n4. **Output**: The function returns the final combined string, as required.\n\nThis function should efficiently extract and combine the Julia code blocks from a markdown document as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[338,435],"elapsed":5.141501667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1617313885,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
