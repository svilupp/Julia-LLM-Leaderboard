[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, I'll take the following approach:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Typically, in markdown, code blocks are enclosed within triple backticks (```` ``` ````). To identify Julia code blocks specifically, these would be wrapped in triple backticks followed by `julia`, i.e., ```` ```julia ````.\n   \n2. **Extract Code Content**: Once we identify the start and end of a Julia code block, the next step is to remove the triple backticks and any language tags so that only the pure code remains.\n\n3. **Concatenate Extracted Blocks**: If there are multiple code blocks, they should be concatenated together with newlines separating them.\n\n### Julia Code Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    inside_code_block = false\n    \n    # Split the markdown input by lines to process it line by line\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # Start of a Julia code block\n            inside_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif inside_code_block && startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # End of a Julia code block\n            inside_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if inside_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all collected code lines separated by a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flags and Control Flow**:\n  - `inside_code_block`: A boolean flag that keeps track of whether we are inside a Julia-specific code block.\n  - If a line starts with ```` ```julia ````, we turn `inside_code_block` on and skip that line.\n  - If a line starts with ```` ``` ```` and `inside_code_block` is on, we turn it off and skip that line.\n  - If `inside_code_block` is true and the line doesn't start with the ending code fence, the line is considered code and added to `code_blocks`.\n\n- **Joining the Blocks**:\n  - Once all Julia code blocks are identified and extracted, they are then joined using a newline separator.\n\n### Double-check:\n\n- The function handles:\n  - Single and multiple code blocks.\n  - Properly handles markdown syntax.\n  - Return the entire concatenated code from all Julia blocks in the order they appear.\n\nThis should efficiently extract all Julia code from the markdown content while ensuring correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[337,534],"elapsed":6.250580916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1459925436,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
