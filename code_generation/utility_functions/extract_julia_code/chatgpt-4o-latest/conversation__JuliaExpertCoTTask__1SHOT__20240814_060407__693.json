[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            julia_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Initialize an empty string `julia_code` to store the extracted code.\n2. Keep a flag `in_code_block` which tracks whether the parser is inside a Julia code block.\n3. Loop through each line of the markdown text.\n4. If the line starts with \"```julia\", set `in_code_block` to true.\n5. If the line starts with \"```\" (and it's not \"```julia\"), it marks the end of the code block, so set `in_code_block` to false.\n6. If the parser is inside a Julia code block, append the current line to `julia_code`, followed by a newline.\n7. Finally, return the extracted code string.\n\nThis function will extract all Julia code blocks from the markdown document, remove the code fences, and concatenate the code together, separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[190,285],"elapsed":3.266159291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-223847853,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
