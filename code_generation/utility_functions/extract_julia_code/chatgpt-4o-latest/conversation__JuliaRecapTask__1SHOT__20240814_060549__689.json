[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Problem Breakdown:\n1. **Parsing the Markdown Document:** We need to iterate through the markdown text to identify code blocks designated for Julia. Code blocks in markdown typically start with triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces.\n  \n2. **Extract Julia Code Blocks:** Only keep code in blocks labeled as Julia. These will usually be of the form:\n   ```\n   ```julia\n   code...\n   ```\n   \n3. **Remove Code Fences:** The triple backticks (```) need to be removed to extract clean Julia code.\n\n4. **Join Multiple Code Blocks:** If there are multiple Julia code blocks, join them together with a newline.\n\n5. **Return the Final Cleaned Code:** Finally, return the cleaned-up code in a single string.\n\n### Julia Implementation:\n\nLet's write the function `extract_julia_code` that implements the above logic.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    in_julia_code_block = false\n    julia_code = String[]\n    code_block = \"\"\n    \n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_code_block = true\n            continue  # Skip this line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_julia_code_block\n                push!(julia_code, code_block)\n                code_block = \"\"  # Reset code block\n            end\n            in_julia_code_block = false\n            continue  # Skip this line\n        end\n        \n        if in_julia_code_block\n            code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join the collected code blocks with a newline, trim any excessive leading/trailing whitespace\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\") |> strip\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`eachline(md)`** helps us parse the markdown document line by line.\n- **`in_julia_code_block` flag** is used to track whether we are inside a Julia code block.\n- **Start and end of a code block** are determined by checking the line against \"```julia\" to start and \"```\" to end.\n- **Collected code** is stored in an array `julia_code`, which at the end is joined together with newlines.\n  \n### Final Thoughts:\nThis function is systematic and adheres to the typical structure of a markdown parser focusing only on blocks marked as Julia code. The function assumes that markdown syntax is respected (e.g., no missing closing ticks), and it concisely extracts and combines multiple code segments if present.","status":200,"tokens":[337,530],"elapsed":6.132561416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1525025766,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
