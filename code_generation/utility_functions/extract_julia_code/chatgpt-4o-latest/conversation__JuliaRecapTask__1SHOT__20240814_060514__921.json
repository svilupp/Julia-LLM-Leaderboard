[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: In markdown, code blocks are typically surrounded by triple backticks (```). Julia code blocks specifically are indicated by ```julia at the beginning of the block.\n  \n2. **Extract Code**: Find all the Julia code blocks, strip the backticks, and collect the actual Julia code.\n\n3. **Concatenate Code Blocks**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, join them with a newline in between.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The result should be a single string containing all the extracted code.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    is_julia = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_code_block\n                in_code_block = false\n                is_julia = false\n            else\n                in_code_block = true\n                is_julia = line == \"```julia\"\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block && is_julia\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**:\n  - `code_blocks` is an array that collects lines of Julia code.\n  - `in_code_block` tracks whether we are inside a code block.\n  - `is_julia` confirms that the code block is specifically Julia.\n\n- **Loop Through Lines**:\n  - `eachline(md)` iterates over each line in the markdown document.\n  - When the line starts with triple backticks (`\"```\"`):\n    - If we are in a code block (`in_code_block == true`), we close it (`in_code_block = false`) and reset the `is_julia` flag.\n    - Otherwise, we start a new code block. We check if it is a Julia code block by comparing the line to `\"```julia\"` and set `in_code_block` and `is_julia` accordingly.\n  \n  - If inside a Julia code block, lines of Julia code are pushed into the `code_blocks` array.\n\n- **Return Statement**:\n  - Finally, we join the collected lines with newline characters `\\n` using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the result as a single concatenated string.\n\nThis function will effectively extract all Julia code blocks from the given markdown and prepare them as one consolidated string, handling multidocuments seamlessly.","status":200,"tokens":[337,555],"elapsed":5.669004042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1755685720,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
