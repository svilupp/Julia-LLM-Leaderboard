[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we need to extract all Julia language code blocks from the given markdown document `md`, remove the code fences (```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ````) and join the extracted code blocks together into a single string, with each block separated by a newline.\n\n## Steps:\n1. **Identify Julia code blocks:** Julia code blocks in markdown start with ```` ```julia ```` and end with ```` ``` ````.\n2. **Extract Blocks:** For each such block, extract the inner lines that contain the code.\n3. **Remove Code Fences:** The beginning and ending lines (i.e., the code fences) should be removed.\n4. **Join the Blocks:** If there are multiple code blocks, they should be concatenated into one single string, separated by newlines.\n\n### Coding Approach:\n- Loop through the content, identify Julia code blocks, capture the contents, and then concatenate them.\n\nNow let's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    julia_blocks = String[]\n    in_julia_block = false\n    current_block = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            push!(julia_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            empty!(current_block)\n        elseif in_julia_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### What the Code Does:\n- **Line Splitting:** The markdown document is split into lines.\n- **Block Identification:** We use flags to identify when we're inside or outside a Julia code block.\n- **Block Collection:** We collect lines inside the blocks, and when a block is closed, we join the lines and store them in a list.\n- **Block Joining:** Finally, all the blocks are joined with newlines, and the combined string is returned.\n\n### Checking the Solution:\n- The function should correctly handle cases where there are multiple Julia code blocks as well as edge cases where there might be no Julia code blocks at all.\n\nThis code should work as expected for the described task.","status":200,"tokens":[338,491],"elapsed":5.000501958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2007317766,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
