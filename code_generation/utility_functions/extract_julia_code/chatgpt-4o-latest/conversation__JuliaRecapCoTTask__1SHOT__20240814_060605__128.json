[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document and returning them as a single string, we need to systematically approach it in the following way:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Julia Code Blocks\nMarkdown syntax typically identifies code blocks using triple backticks ``` to start and end a block. Julia code blocks are specifically identified by ```julia at the start of the block.\n\n### Step 2: Extract the Code Blocks\nWe'll search for these ` ```julia ` blocks within the markdown content. Once we find a start and end of a block, extract all lines in between them.\n\n### Step 3: Remove Fences and Join Code Blocks\nWe'll then strip out the fences and concatenate all the extracted code blocks into a single string, joining them with newline characters.\n\n### Step 4: Return the Result\nFinally, return the concatenated string as the output.\n\nNow, letâ€™s implement the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Variables to track if we are inside a julia code block and to accumulate the code\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the collected lines with newlines\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Step 5: Double-check\n- The function checks each line to determine if it's inside a Julia code block.\n- Each relevant line is added to an array, which is finally joined with newlines to form the final output.\n- Regular expression or sophisticated parsing isn't needed for this task, which makes this approach both straightforward and efficient.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the principles of clarity and correctness while using built-in Julia functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[338,427],"elapsed":4.659079958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1936897100,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
