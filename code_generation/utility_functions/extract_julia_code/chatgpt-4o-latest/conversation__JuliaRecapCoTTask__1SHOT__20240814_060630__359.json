[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia code from a markdown document, we will systematically follow these steps:\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: We can leverage regular expressions to identify and extract Julia code blocks enclosed within triple backticks ``` (``` ```).\n2. **Remove the Code Fences**: Once we extract the code blocks, we remove the initial and final lines containing the backticks.\n3. **Concatenate All Code Blocks**: Join all the extracted code blocks into a single string with newline separators.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the resulting string.\n\n### Julia Concepts to Use:\n- **Regular Expressions (`r\"...\"`)**: To identify the Julia code blocks in the markdown.\n- **String Manipulation**: To remove code fences and concatenate multiple blocks.\n- **Iterating Through Matches**: Using a loop (e.g., `for` or broadcasting).\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe function will look something like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    # Regex to identify code fences with language specified as \"julia\"\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Extract the matched content (code inside the code fences)\n        code_block = match.captures[1]\n        \n        # Append the cleaned code block to the list\n        push!(julia_code_blocks, code_block)\n    end\n\n    # Join all collected code blocks with newline separation\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **eachmatch**: Iterates over all matches for the given pattern in the `md` string.\n- `captures[1]`: Extracts the content between the triple backticks.\n- **join**: Combines all extracted blocks into a single string with newlines to separate them.\n\n### Double-Check:\n- Ensure the handling of multiple code blocks and the correct identification of blocks specific to the Julia language.\n- Validate no extra newlines or code fences remain in the final output.\n  \nThis function satisfies the requirement and follows a systematic approach, focusing on clarity and using Julia's powerful string manipulation functions.\n\nThis implementation assumes the markdown string follows correct formatting and Julia code blocks are properly delimited. Ensure this is confirmed in unit tests.","status":200,"tokens":[338,485],"elapsed":5.655255375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1339973657,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
