[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Initialize an empty string `code` to store the extracted Julia code.\n2. Use regular expressions to find all the code blocks in the markdown document `md`.\n3. Iterate over each code block found.\n4. Check if the code block starts with a Julia code fence (```julia) and ends with a code fence (```).\n5. If the code block is a Julia code block, remove the code fences and append the code to the `code` string.\n6. If there are multiple Julia code blocks, append a newline character after each code block (except the last one).\n7.

The function takes a markdown document `md` as input and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks extracted from the document, with code fences removed and joined together with newlines.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`, which represents the markdown document.\n2. An empty string `code` is initialized to store the extracted Julia code.\n3. The regular expression `r\"```(.*?)```\"s` is used to find all the code blocks in the markdown document `md`. The `overlap=false` option is specified to ensure that overlapping code blocks are not matched.\n4. The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over each code block found.\n5. For each code block, the content is extracted using `block.captures[1]`.\n6. The function `startswith` is used to check if the code block starts with a Julia code fence (```julia).\n7. If the code block is a Julia code block, the Julia code fence is removed using `strip(content, ['`', 'j'])`. The resulting Julia code is appended to the `code` string.\n8. If there are multiple Julia code blocks, a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) is appended after each code block (except the last one) to separate them.\n9. Finally, the `strip` function is used to remove any trailing newline characters from the `code` string, and the final string is returned.\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` should be able to extract all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document and return them as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[391,794],"elapsed":5.611639,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":783330590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
