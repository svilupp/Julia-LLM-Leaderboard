[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible solution in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the regex pattern for Julia code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown text\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join with a newline\n    code = join(match.captures[1] for match in matches, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks in the markdown text. It then uses this pattern to find all matches in the text, extracts the code from each match, and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The function finally returns the extracted code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[219,206],"elapsed":1.492650791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":200532746,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
