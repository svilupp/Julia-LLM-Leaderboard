[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in a markdown document\n    # This pattern assumes that the code blocks start with ```julia and end with ```\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the Julia code from each match and join it into a single string\n    # We use the join function with a newline character as the separator\n    julia_code = join(map(match -> match.captures[1], matches), \"\\n\")\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the Julia code from each match and joins it into a single string, with a newline character as the separator.","status":200,"tokens":[391,251],"elapsed":1.855364791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-271297780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
