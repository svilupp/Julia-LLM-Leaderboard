Here's a simple function that should do the job in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s, md)\n    code = join(map(m -> m.match[5:end-3], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to find all code blocks that start and end with \"```julia\". It then extracts the code from each match, removes the \"```julia\" and \"```\" lines, and joins all the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[84,172],"elapsed":1.226047459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-357959913,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
