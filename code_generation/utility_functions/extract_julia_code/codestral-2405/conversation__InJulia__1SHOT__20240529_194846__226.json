This function assumes that the code blocks are properly fenced with ````julia and ````. If they are not, or if they are fenced with different strings, you will need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[84,240],"elapsed":1.687052125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":344478473,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
