Here is the Julia function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    parsed = parse(md)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n\n    for element in parsed.content\n        if isa(element, Markdown.Code) && element.lang == \"julia\"\n            push!(code_blocks, element.code)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown document using the `Markdown` package. Then, it iterates over each element in the parsed document and checks if it is a code block with the language specified as \"julia\". If it is, it adds the code from that block to an array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,224],"elapsed":1.592821958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1030292207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
