Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function can be implemented using regular expressions to match the code blocks and extract the Julia code.

It then extracts the Julia code from each block and joins them together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[125,169],"elapsed":1.2311275,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1568094637,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
