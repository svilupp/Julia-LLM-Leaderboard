[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's a function that should do what you're asking for. This function uses regular expressions to find code blocks in the markdown document and then joins them together with a newline.\n\n```julia\nusing Match\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.|\\n)*?```\", md))\n\n    # Extract the code from each block and join with a newline\n    code = join([match.match[6:end-3] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that your julia code blocks are surrounded by ```julia at the start and ``` at the end. If your code blocks use a different syntax, you'll need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[393,211],"elapsed":1.521441041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-408207399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
