Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = filter(m -> m.match == \"```julia\", eachmatch(r\"```(.*)\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, overlap=false))\n    return join(map(m -> m.captures[2], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown document that are marked as Julia code. It then extracts the Julia code from each code block and joins them together with a newline character. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[125,151],"elapsed":1.084879792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1366807553,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
