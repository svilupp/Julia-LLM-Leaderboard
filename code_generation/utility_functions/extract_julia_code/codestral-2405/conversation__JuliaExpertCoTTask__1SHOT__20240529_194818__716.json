[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution that uses regular expressions to find and extract the code blocks. The function `extract_julia_code` searches for lines starting with \"```julia\" and ending with \"```\" and joins the lines between these lines into a single string.\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Crayons\")\nusing Crayons\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # regex pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # join the code blocks with a newline\n    return join(map(m -> m.captures[1], matches), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work for the given example, but it's important to note that this is a very basic parser and may not work correctly for all possible markdown documents. In particular, it assumes that the code blocks are well-formed and that there are no nested code blocks or other complex structures.","status":200,"tokens":[219,252],"elapsed":1.798147333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1506569786,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
