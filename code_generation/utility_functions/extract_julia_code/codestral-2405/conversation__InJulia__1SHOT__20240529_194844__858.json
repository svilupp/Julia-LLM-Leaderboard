Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia language code blocks from a markdown document and returns a string with the extracted code:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    doc = parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter(node -> node isa Markdown.Code && node.lang == \"julia\", doc.content)\n\n    # Extract the code from each code block and remove code fences\n    code = [replace(code_block.text, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\") for code_block in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract all the code blocks that have the language specified as \"julia\". It then removes the code fences (```julia` and ```) from each code block and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[84,281],"elapsed":1.971883334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1544178188,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
