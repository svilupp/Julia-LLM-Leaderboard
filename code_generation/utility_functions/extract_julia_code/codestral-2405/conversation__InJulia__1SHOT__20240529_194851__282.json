[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in a markdown document\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Extract all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = match(regex, md)\n\n    # If there are no Julia code blocks, return an empty string\n    if code_blocks === nothing\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    extracted_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match any text that is surrounded by ```julia and ```. The `s` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it so that the `.` character matches newline characters as well. The `match` function returns a vector of all matches, so we join them together with newlines using the `join` function. If there are no matches, `match` returns `nothing`, so we return an empty string in that case.","status":200,"tokens":[84,282],"elapsed":2.072771833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1510916730,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
