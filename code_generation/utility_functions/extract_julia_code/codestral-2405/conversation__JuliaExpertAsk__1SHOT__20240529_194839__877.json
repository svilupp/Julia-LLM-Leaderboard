It then iterates through each block of the document. If the block is a code block and the language is Julia, it appends the code to the `julia_code` string. If the next block is also a Julia code block, it appends a newline character to separate the code. Finally, it returns the `julia_code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[125,269],"elapsed":1.887032916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-884362282,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
