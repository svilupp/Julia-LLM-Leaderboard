Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Extract all Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    extracted_code = join(match.captures[1] for match in matches, \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression that matches Julia code blocks in a markdown document. It then uses this regular expression to find all matches in the input string. The captured groups (which are the Julia code blocks) are then joined together with a newline character and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[84,209],"elapsed":1.472721375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2126374497,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
