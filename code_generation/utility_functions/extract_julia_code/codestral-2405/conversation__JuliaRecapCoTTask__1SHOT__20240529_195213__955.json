[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe `extract_julia_code` function first defines a regular expression that matches code blocks with julia language. It then uses this regex to find all matches in the provided markdown document. The captured code blocks are collected in a list, and finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks with a newline character in between. This function returns the extracted julia code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[393,176],"elapsed":1.366003,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":970604977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
