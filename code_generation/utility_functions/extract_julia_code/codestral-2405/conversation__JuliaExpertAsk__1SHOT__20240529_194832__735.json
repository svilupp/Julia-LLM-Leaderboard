It then iterates through the blocks of the document, checking if they are code blocks that contain Julia code. If they are, it removes the code fences and appends the code to the `code` string, adding a newline character in between blocks if necessary. The function then returns the `code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[125,228],"elapsed":1.600412292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2100901454,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
