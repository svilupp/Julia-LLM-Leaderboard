It then filters out the code blocks and only keeps the ones that are Julia code (by checking if \"julia\" is in the language attribute of the code block). Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,227],"elapsed":1.598050459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1095646499,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
