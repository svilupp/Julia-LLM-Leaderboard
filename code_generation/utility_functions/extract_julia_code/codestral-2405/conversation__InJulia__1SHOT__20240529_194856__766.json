Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"CommonMark\")\n\nusing CommonMark\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse(md)\n    code_blocks = filter(n -> isa(n, CommonMark.CodeBlock) && n.data.info == \"julia\", doc.children)\n    code = join(map(cb -> cb.data.code, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `CommonMark.jl` package to parse the markdown document and extract the Julia code blocks. It then joins the code from each block together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,198],"elapsed":1.44738825,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-579760818,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
