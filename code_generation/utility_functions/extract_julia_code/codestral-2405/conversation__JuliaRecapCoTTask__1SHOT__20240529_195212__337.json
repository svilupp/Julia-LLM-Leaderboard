[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I will write a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that will take a markdown document as input and extract all the code blocks that contain Julia language code. The function will then remove the code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline character. The resulting string will be returned as the output.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]  # to store the extracted code blocks\n    in_code_block = false  # to track whether we are inside a code block\n    code_block = \"\"  # to store the current code block\n\n    # iterate through each line in the markdown document\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        # check if the line starts with \"```\"\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_code_block\n                # we are at the end of a code block\n                push!(code_blocks, code_block)  # add the code block to the list\n                code_block = \"\"  # reset the current code block\n            else\n                # we are at the start of a code block\n                in_code_block = true\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block\n            # we are inside a code block, so append the line to the current code block\n            code_block = code_block * line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # join the code blocks together with a newline character and return the result\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md`, which is the markdown document as a string. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, a boolean variable `in_code_block` to track whether we are inside a code block, and an empty string `code_block` to store the current code block.\n\nThe function then iterates through each line in the markdown document. If a line starts with \"```\", it checks whether we are inside a code block. If we are, it means we have reached the end of a code block, so it adds the current code block to the `code_blocks` array and resets the `code_block` string. If we are not inside a code block, it means we have reached the start of a code block, so it sets the `in_code_block` variable to `true`. If the line does not start with \"```\" and we are inside a code block, it appends the line to the current code block.\n\nFinally, the function joins the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[393,634],"elapsed":4.477445292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2141254744,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
