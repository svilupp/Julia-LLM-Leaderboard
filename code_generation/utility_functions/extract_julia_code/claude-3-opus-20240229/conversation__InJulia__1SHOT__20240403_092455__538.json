We define an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n\n2. We initialize two variables: `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block, and `current_block` to store the current code block being extracted.\n\n3. We split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and iterate over each line.\n\n4. For each line, we check the following conditions:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `false`, append the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array, and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (i.e., `in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to `current_block` along with a newline character.\n\n5. After processing all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks stored in `code_blocks` using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`, which concatenates the code blocks with newline separators.\n\n6. Finally, we return the joined code blocks as a single string.\n\nThis function takes a markdown document as input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code blocks, with code fences removed and multiple code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,552],"elapsed":21.670724708,"cost":0.0426,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1722,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
