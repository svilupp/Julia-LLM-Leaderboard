[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n2. Initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block.\n3. Split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n4. Iterate over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate that we are entering a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), set `in_code_block` to `false` to indicate that we are exiting a code block.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), append the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n5. After iterating over all the lines, join the code blocks together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, '\\n')`.\n6. Return the resulting string containing the extracted Julia code.\n\nThis function correctly handles markdown documents with multiple Julia code blocks and removes the code fences while preserving the code itself.","status":200,"tokens":[198,414],"elapsed":15.678243292,"cost":0.034019999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23570,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
