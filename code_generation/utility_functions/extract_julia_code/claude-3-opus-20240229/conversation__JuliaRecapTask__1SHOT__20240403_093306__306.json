[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_lines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nKey aspects:\n\n1. The function takes a markdown string `md` and returns a `String`.\n\n2. It splits the markdown into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`. \n\n3. It maintains a flag `in_code_block` to track whether the current line is inside a code block.\n\n4. It iterates through each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate entering a Julia code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" and `in_code_block` is `true`, it sets `in_code_block` to `false` to indicate exiting a code block.\n   - If `in_code_block` is `true`, it appends the current line (without the code fence) to the `code_lines` array.\n\n5. Finally, it joins the `code_lines` array with newline characters (`'\\n'`) and returns the result as a string.\n\nThis extracts all the Julia code blocks, removes the code fences, and concatenates the code together with newlines in between if there are multiple blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[367,418],"elapsed":16.914211917,"cost":0.036855,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31946,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
