Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThe function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a markdown document `md` as an `AbstractString` input.\n2. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. It uses a flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether the current line is inside a code block.\n4. It splits the markdown document into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n5. It iterates over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true`, indicating the start of a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, indicating the end of a code block.\n   - If `in_code_block` is `true` and the line is not a code fence, it appends the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n6. Finally, it joins the extracted code blocks together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, '\\n')` and returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function handles multiple code blocks by appending them to the `code_blocks` array and joining them together at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[117,434],"elapsed":15.136816125,"cost":0.034304999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32027,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
