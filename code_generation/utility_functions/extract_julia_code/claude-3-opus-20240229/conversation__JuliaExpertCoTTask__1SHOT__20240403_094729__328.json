[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    in_block = false\n    code_lines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_block = false\n        elseif in_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n\"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. Split the markdown string into lines \n2. Initialize a boolean `in_block` to track if we are currently inside a code block\n3. Initialize an empty array `code_lines` to store the code lines\n4. Iterate through each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\" set `in_block` to `true` \n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (ending a block), set `in_block` to `false`\n   - If `in_block` is `true`, push the current line to `code_lines`\n5. Join the `code_lines` array with newline characters\n\nThis extracts all the Julia code blocks, removes the fences, and joins multiple blocks together with newlines as required.","status":200,"tokens":[198,373],"elapsed":15.169734125,"cost":0.030944999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14513,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
