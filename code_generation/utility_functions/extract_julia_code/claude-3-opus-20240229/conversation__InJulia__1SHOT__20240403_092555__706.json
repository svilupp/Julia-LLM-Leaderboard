We define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as a string input.\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. We also initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not.\n4. We split the markdown document into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n5. We iterate over each line of the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `false`.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to the `code_blocks` array.\n6. After iterating over all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks together using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`, which separates each code block with a newline character.\n7. Finally, we return the resulting string containing the extracted and joined code blocks.\n\nThis function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are properly fenced with \"```julia\" and \"```\". It extracts the code blocks, removes the code fences, and returns the code blocks as a single string, with each code block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[80,517],"elapsed":19.348453833,"cost":0.039975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13387,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
