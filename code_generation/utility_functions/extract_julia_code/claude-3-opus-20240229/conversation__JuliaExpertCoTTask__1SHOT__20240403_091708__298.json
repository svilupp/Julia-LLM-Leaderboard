[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIt works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code lines\n2. Set a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track if we are currently inside a code block\n3. Split the input markdown string `md` by newline to get individual lines\n4. Iterate through each line:\n    - If the line starts with \"```julia\", set `in_code_block` to true indicating we entered a code block\n    - If the line starts with just \"```\", set `in_code_block` to false indicating we exited a code block \n    - If `in_code_block` is true (we are inside a code block), append the line to `code_blocks`\n5. After processing all lines, join the extracted code lines in `code_blocks` with newlines and return the result as a String\n\nThis extracts all julia code blocks, removes the surrounding fences, and concatenates the code together.\n\nLet's test it on the provided input:\n\n```julia\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\n\nThe code block was correctly extracted and code fences removed.","status":200,"tokens":[198,425],"elapsed":15.156113375,"cost":0.034845,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
