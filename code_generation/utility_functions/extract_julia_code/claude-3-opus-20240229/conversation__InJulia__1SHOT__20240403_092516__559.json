We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block, and a string `current_block` to store the current code block being processed.\n\n2. We split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and iterate over each line.\n\n3. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n\n4. If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block. We set `in_code_block` to `false`. If `current_block` is not empty, we append it to the `code_blocks` array and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n\n5. If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to `current_block` along with a newline character.\n\n6. After iterating over all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks stored in `code_blocks` using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`, which concatenates the code blocks with newline separators.\n\n7. Finally, we return the joined code blocks as a single string.\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, removes the code fences (```julia and ```), and joins the code blocks together with newlines, returning the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,566],"elapsed":20.8333585,"cost":0.043649999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2995,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
