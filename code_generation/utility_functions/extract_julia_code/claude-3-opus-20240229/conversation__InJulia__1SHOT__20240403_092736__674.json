We define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document as a string `md` and returns the extracted Julia code as a string.\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. We initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block.\n4. We initialize an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being extracted.\n5. We iterate over each line of the markdown document by splitting it on newline characters.\n6. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the start of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n7. If the line starts with \"```\", it indicates the end of a code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `false`. If `current_block` is not empty, we append it to the `code_blocks` array and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n8. If we are currently inside a code block (i.e., `in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to `current_block` along with a newline character.\n9. After iterating through all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks in `code_blocks` with newline characters using `join()` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document, remove the code fences, and return the code blocks joined together with newlines as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,571],"elapsed":21.25516525,"cost":0.044024999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
