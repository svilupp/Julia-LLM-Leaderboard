[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if occursin(r\"^```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif occursin(r\"^```$\", line)\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the lines of code from the code blocks.\n\n2. We initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block.\n\n3. We split the markdown string `md` into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n\n4. We iterate over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", we set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate we are entering a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (closing code fence), we set `in_code_block` to `false` to indicate we are exiting a code block.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to the `code_blocks` array.\n\n5. After processing all the lines, we join the lines in `code_blocks` with newline characters (`'\\n'`) using `join(code_blocks, '\\n')` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input, extracts the code blocks marked with \"```julia\" fences, removes the fences, and joins the code blocks together with newline characters. It returns the extracted Julia code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,459],"elapsed":21.009686125,"cost":0.03993,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10243,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
