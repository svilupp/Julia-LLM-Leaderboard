It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n\n2. It initializes a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether the current line is within a code block.\n\n3. It splits the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n4. It iterates over each line of the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true`, indicating the start of a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, indicating the end of a code block.\n   - If `in_code_block` is `true`, it means the current line is within a code block, so it appends the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n\n5. Finally, it joins the extracted code blocks together using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`, separating each code block with a newline, and returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function takes a markdown document as input and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks extracted from the document, with code fences removed and code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,465],"elapsed":16.6138835,"cost":0.036074999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23469,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
