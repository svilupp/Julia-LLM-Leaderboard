[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code from markdown code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_lines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Split the markdown string into lines \n2. Keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block with `in_code_block`\n3. When a line starts with \"```julia\", set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate we are entering a code block\n4. When a line starts with just \"```\", set `in_code_block` to `false` as we are exiting the code block\n5. If `in_code_block` is `true` and it's not a fence line, add the line to the `code_lines` array\n6. Finally, join all the `code_lines` with newline characters\n\nThis will extract the Julia code, remove the fences, and return the code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,329],"elapsed":15.31043375,"cost":0.03018,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
