We define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a single argument `md` of type `String`, which represents the markdown document.\n\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n\n3. We initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not.\n\n4. We initialize an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being extracted.\n\n5. We split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, '\\n')` and iterate over each line.\n\n6. For each line, we check the following conditions:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the start of a Julia code block. We set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate that we are now inside a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block. We set `in_code_block` to `false`, push the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array, and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (i.e., `in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to the `current_block` string, followed by a newline character (\"\\n\").\n\n7. After processing all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document, remove the code fences (i.e., the \"```julia\" and \"```\" lines), and join the code blocks together with newline characters. The resulting string will contain only the Julia code without any markdown formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[80,607],"elapsed":22.269875708,"cost":0.046724999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28026,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
