We define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a single argument `md` of type `String`, representing the markdown document.\n\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n\n3. We initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether the current line is within a code block or not.\n\n4. We split the markdown document `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n5. We iterate over each line in the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a Julia code block. We set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block. We set `in_code_block` to `false`.\n   - If `in_code_block` is `true`, it means the current line is within a code block. We append the line to the `code_blocks` array using `push!()`.\n\n6. After iterating over all the lines, we join the code blocks together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, removes the code fences (i.e., the lines starting with \"```julia\" and \"```\"), and concatenates the code blocks together with newline characters. The resulting string contains the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[80,518],"elapsed":19.742686417,"cost":0.040049999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31102,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
