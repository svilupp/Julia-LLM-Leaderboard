[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together with newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_lines = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. It splits the markdown document `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. It initializes a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether the current line is inside a Julia code block or not.\n\n3. It initializes an empty array `code_lines` to store the lines of code.\n\n4. It iterates over each line in the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true`, indicating the start of a Julia code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, indicating the end of a code block.\n   - If `in_code_block` is `true` and the line is not a code fence, it appends the line to `code_lines`.\n\n5. Finally, it joins the lines of code in `code_lines` using `join(code_lines, \"\\n\")` with a newline separator and returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function uses the `AbstractString` type to allow flexibility in the input type, and it returns a `String` as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[367,459],"elapsed":20.646984875,"cost":0.03993,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30491,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
