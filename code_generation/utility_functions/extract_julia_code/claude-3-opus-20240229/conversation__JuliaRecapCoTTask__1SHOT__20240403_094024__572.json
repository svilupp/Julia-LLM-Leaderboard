[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nKey aspects:\n\n- It takes a markdown string `md` as input \n- Initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the code lines\n- Uses a flag `in_code_block` to track if currently inside a julia code block\n- Splits the markdown string by newline to process line by line\n- If a line starts with \"```julia\" it indicates start of a code block, so set flag to true\n- If a line starts with \"```\" and already in a code block, it indicates end of block, so set flag to false \n- If inside a code block and line doesn't mark end of block, it is a code line so append it to `code_blocks`\n- Finally, join all the collected `code_blocks` with newline and return the result string\n\nThe function handles multiple code blocks by joining them together with newlines. It skips the code fences while extracting.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[368,369],"elapsed":21.085801667,"cost":0.033194999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30033,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
