[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are the steps to solve this task in Julia:\n\n1. Use `split(md, \"```\")` to split the markdown string on code fences. This will alternate between non-code and code blocks.\n\n2. Filter the split blocks to only those that start with \"julia\\n\", indicating a Julia code block. \n\n3. For each code block, remove the leading \"julia\\n\" with `replace(block, r\"^julia\\n\" => \"\")`.\n\n4. Join the processed code blocks together with newlines using `join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")`.\n\nHere is the function that implements this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    codeblocks = filter(block -> startswith(block, \"julia\\n\"), blocks)\n    codeblocks = map(block -> replace(block, r\"^julia\\n\" => \"\"), codeblocks)\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nTo double check:\n\n- The function takes a markdown string as input and returns a String\n- It correctly splits on code fences, filters to Julia blocks, strips the \"julia\\n\" marker\n- The code blocks are joined together with newline if there are multiple\n- It uses abstract String type for the argument and return\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[368,321],"elapsed":15.717158125,"cost":0.029595,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
