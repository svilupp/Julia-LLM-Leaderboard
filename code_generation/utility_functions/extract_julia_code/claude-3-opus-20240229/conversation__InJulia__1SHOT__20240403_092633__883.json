We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block, and a string `code_block` to store the current code block being extracted.\n\n2. We split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and iterate over each line.\n\n3. For each line, we check the following conditions:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a Julia code block. We set `in_code_block` to `true` to mark that we are now inside a code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block. If `in_code_block` is `true`, we append the current `code_block` to the `code_blocks` array, reset `code_block` to an empty string, and set `in_code_block` to `false` to mark that we are no longer inside a code block.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to the `code_block` string followed by a newline character.\n\n4. After iterating over all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks in the `code_blocks` array together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document, remove the code fences (```julia and ```), and return a string containing the concatenated code blocks separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,614],"elapsed":21.803753291,"cost":0.04724999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
