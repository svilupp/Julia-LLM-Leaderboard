[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Function takes an `AbstractString` to be general for any string type\n- Returns a `String`\n- Initializes an empty `String` array to store the code block lines\n- Uses a flag `in_code_block` to track if currently inside a Julia code block \n- Splits the markdown string by newline to process line by line\n- If line starts with \"```julia\" sets flag to indicate start of code block\n- If line starts with just \"```\" resets flag to indicate end of code block\n- If flag is set and not a fence, appends the code line \n- Finally joins all the code lines with a newline delimiter\n\nThis extracts just the Julia code without any markdown formatting. It handles single or multiple code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[367,322],"elapsed":17.949077709,"cost":0.029654999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17206,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
