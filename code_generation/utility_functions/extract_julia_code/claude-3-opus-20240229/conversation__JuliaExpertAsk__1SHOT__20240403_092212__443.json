Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise function that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)```\"m, md)\n    isempty(code_blocks) && return \"\"\n    join((m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks), '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThe function uses `eachmatch` with a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned. Otherwise, the captured code blocks are joined with newlines using `join`.","status":200,"tokens":[117,152],"elapsed":7.195135166,"cost":0.013154999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5585,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
