[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis systematically does:\n\n1. Split the markdown string `md` into lines\n2. Loop through each line:\n    - If the line starts with \"```julia\", we are entering a Julia code block, so set `in_code_block` flag to true\n    - If the line starts with just \"```\", we are exiting a code block, so set flag to false \n    - If we are currently in a code block (`in_code_block` is true), then add the current line to the `code_blocks` array\n3. After processing all lines, join the accumulated `code_blocks` with newline characters\n4. Return the joined code string\n\nSome key things:\n- Uses `AbstractString` type for `md` to accept any string type\n- Explicitly annotates return type as `String`\n- Uses array of `String` to accumulate code blocks\n- Checks for both opening \"```julia\" and closing \"```\" code fences\n- Joins code blocks together with newlines if there are multiple\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[368,390],"elapsed":18.188534875,"cost":0.034769999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29808,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
