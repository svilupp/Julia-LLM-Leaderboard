We define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as a string input.\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. We initialize a boolean variable `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block.\n4. We initialize an empty string `code_block` to store the current code block being extracted.\n5. We split the markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n6. We iterate over each line of the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the start of a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\", it indicates the end of a code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `false`, append the current `code_block` to the `code_blocks` array, and reset `code_block` to an empty string.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to the `code_block` string, along with a newline character.\n7. Finally, we join all the extracted code blocks together using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document, removes the code fences (triple backticks), and joins the code blocks together with a newline separator.","status":200,"tokens":[80,553],"elapsed":20.787495541,"cost":0.042675,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
