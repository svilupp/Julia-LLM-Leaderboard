[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = [(m.offset, m.offset + length(m.match)) \n                    for m in eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s, md, overlap=false)]\n    \n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        return join(map(code_blocks) do (start, stop)\n                   strip(md[start+9:stop-3])\n               end, \n               \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Use `eachmatch` with a regex to find all the code blocks delimited by ```julia and ``` fences. The `s` modifier treats the `.` as matching newlines too. `overlap=false` prevents overlapping matches.\n\n2. Extract the start and stop indexes of each code block match into `code_blocks`. \n\n3. If no code blocks found, return an empty string.\n\n4. Otherwise, for each code block:\n   - Slice the markdown string from start+9 to stop-3 to exclude the fences\n   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace \n   \n5. Join the extracted code blocks together separated by a newline.\n\n6. Return the result as a String.\n\nThe main types used are `AbstractString` and `String` to be flexible on string inputs but concrete on the return type. Mapping and joining is preferred over a for loop for readability.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[368,372],"elapsed":18.687176,"cost":0.03342,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4536,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
