[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_lines = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Split the markdown document into lines \n2. Initialize an array `code_lines` to store the code lines\n3. Use a flag `in_code_block` to track whether we are currently inside a code block\n4. Iterate through each line:\n    - If the line starts with \"```julia\" it means we are entering a code block, so set `in_code_block` to `true`\n    - If the line starts with \"```\" and we are already in a code block, it means the code block is ending, so set `in_code_block` to `false` \n    - If we are inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), then add the current line to `code_lines`\n5. Finally, join all the `code_lines` with newline characters and return the result as a String\n\nThis extracts all the Julia code blocks, removes the fences, and concatenates multiple code blocks together if present.","status":200,"tokens":[368,384],"elapsed":16.763574,"cost":0.034319999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15744,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
