We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track whether we are currently inside a code block, and a string `code_block` to accumulate the lines of code within a code block.\n\n2. We split the markdown document `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n3. We iterate over each line of the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a code block. We set `in_code_block` to `true` and continue to the next line.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it indicates the end of a code block. We set `in_code_block` to `false`, strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the `code_block`, and push it to the `code_blocks` array. We then reset `code_block` to an empty string and continue to the next line.\n   - If we are currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to `code_block` along with a newline character.\n\n4. After iterating over all the lines, we join the extracted code blocks from `code_blocks` using a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function takes a markdown document as input and returns a string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks, with code fences removed and multiple code blocks joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[80,550],"elapsed":20.403216166,"cost":0.042449999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19605,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
