[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, m -> m[1], s=true)\n    \n    # Join code blocks with newline\n    code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `matchall` function returns a vector of all matches, and the `m -> m[1]` function is used to extract the captured group (i.e., the code block itself) from each match. The `s=true` argument makes the dot (`.`) special character match any character, including a newline. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[194,200],"elapsed":1.238468125,"cost":0.00027246,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1692025379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
