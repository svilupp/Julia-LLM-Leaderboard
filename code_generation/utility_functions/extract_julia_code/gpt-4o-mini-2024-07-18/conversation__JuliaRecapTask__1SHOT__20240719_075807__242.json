[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code from a markdown document, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the code blocks in the markdown using the code fences (```) that surround the Julia code.\n2. Extract the content between these fences.\n3. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each block.\n4. Join all extracted code blocks with a newline character.\n5. Return the accumulated string.\n\nNow, here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the document into lines to look for code fences\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = String[]  # Array to hold extracted code blocks\n    collecting = false\n    current_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a code fence\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # If we were already collecting, we have reached the end of a block\n            if collecting\n                push!(code_blocks, strip(current_block))  # Save the current block\n                current_block = \"\"  # Reset the current block\n            end\n            collecting = !collecting  # Toggle collecting state\n        elseif collecting\n            # If we are in a code block, add the line to the current block\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the collected code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check the solution:\n\n- The function works with an `AbstractString` input, allowing flexible string handling.\n- It correctly identifies and collects Julia code blocks surrounded by code fences.\n- It strips unnecessary whitespace from each block and rejoins them with newlines.\n- The toggling mechanism properly handles the opening and closing of code blocks.\n\nThe implementation appears to be correct and follows the designated requirements effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[337,392],"elapsed":7.13961,"cost":0.00028575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2069849530,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
