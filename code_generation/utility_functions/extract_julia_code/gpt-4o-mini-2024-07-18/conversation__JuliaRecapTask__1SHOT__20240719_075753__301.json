[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, I will create a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document as input. This function will identify and extract code blocks that are formatted for Julia, remove the code fences, and then join them together into a single string with newlines separating the blocks.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize an array to hold extracted code lines\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    # Boolean to track if we are currently inside a code block\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_code = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check for code fences that start/stop julia code blocks\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_code_block\n                # End of a code block\n                push!(code_blocks, current_code)\n                current_code = \"\"\n                in_code_block = false\n            else\n                # Start of a code block\n                in_code_block = true\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block\n            # Collect lines that are part of the code block\n            current_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all collected Julia code blocks with newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNext, I will double-check that the implementation correctly identifies code blocks, removes the code fences, and concatenates the code blocks with newlines if more than one exists. \n\n1. The function checks each line for the presence of the fences. \n2. It keeps track of whether it is within a code block and collects the lines accordingly.\n3. Finally, it returns a single string of the collected code blocks, joining them with newlines.\n\nThis solution adheres to the requirements outlined in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[337,395],"elapsed":5.790071667,"cost":0.00028754999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-226931344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
