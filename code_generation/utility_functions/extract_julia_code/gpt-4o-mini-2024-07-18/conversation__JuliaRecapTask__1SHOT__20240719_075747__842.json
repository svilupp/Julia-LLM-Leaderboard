[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Recall useful Julia snippets**: We'll need to use string manipulation functions to identify and extract the code blocks, and to join them together.\n\n2. **Write the function**: We'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown input string, uses regex to find and extract the code blocks, and finally joins them into a single output string.\n\n3. **Double-check the solution**: We'll ensure that the function appropriately handles various markdown formatting scenarios.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Define a regex pattern to match code blocks for Julia\n    pattern = r\"```julia([\\s\\S]*?)```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown text\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from the matches, removing leading/trailing whitespace\n    code_blocks = [strip(m.match) for m in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newlines and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function accomplishes the following:\n- It uses a regex pattern to match Julia code blocks delimited by triple backticks.\n- It extracts the content from each block, stripping any unnecessary whitespace.\n- It concatenates all the extracted code blocks with newline characters between them and returns the final string.\n\nNow let's proceed to double-check the solution:\n- The regex pattern is designed to capture anything between the triple backticks specifically for Julia.\n- The use of `matchall` ensures that all occurrences are found, even if there are multiple code blocks.\n- The joining of the code blocks with `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` is correctly implemented to provide a single string output.\n\nThis implementation should work correctly for the defined task.","status":200,"tokens":[337,392],"elapsed":7.721282208,"cost":0.00028575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1677680553,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
