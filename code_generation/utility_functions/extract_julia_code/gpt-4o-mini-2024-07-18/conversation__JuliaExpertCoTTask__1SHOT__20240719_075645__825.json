Identify the structure of the code blocks in the markdown, which are surrounded by triple backticks (```) and followed by the language identifier `julia`.\n2. Use a regular expression to find and capture the content of these code blocks.\n3. Remove the code fences from the captured content.\n4. Join all the extracted code blocks together with a newline.\n\nNow, let's implement the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Use a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract and clean code from each matched block\n    cleaned_code = [strip(m.match[1]) for m in code_blocks]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newline\n    return join(cleaned_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's solve the task using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")\n```\n\nFinally, we will check that the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nprintln(result)  # Output should be: println(\"hello world\")\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[190,284],"elapsed":2.85676525,"cost":0.00019889999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1931687304,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
