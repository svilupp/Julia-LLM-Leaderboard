X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Hereâ€™s a systematic approach to the task.\n\n### Problem Solving Steps\n1. **Recall Julia snippets**: For string manipulation and regular expressions, we can use `contains`, `match`, and string functions such as `split` and `join`.\n2. **Solve the Task**: We will create a function that processes the input markdown to extract code blocks. We will handle the code fences and join multiple blocks with newlines.\n3. **Double-check**: Ensure the solution correctly extracts the blocks and treats edge cases (like no code blocks) properly.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split the input markdown on lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an array to hold the code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif line == \"```\" && in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_code_block\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks with a newline and trim\n    return join(map(strip, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown string as input.\n- It splits the string into lines and initializes necessary variables for tracking if we're inside a code block.\n- It checks for the starting and ending fences of Julia code, collecting lines of code in between.\n- Once collected, it joins all code blocks together with newlines and trims whitespace.\n\n### Double-check:\nThe function adheres to the requirements and correctly handles:\n- Multiple code blocks.\n- This implementation will correctly extract and join without extra newlines or whitespace issues. \n\nThis solution looks efficient and follows the specifications given.","status":200,"tokens":[338,419],"elapsed":4.390238125,"cost":0.00030209999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1402994398,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
