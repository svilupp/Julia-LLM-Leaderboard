[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Use regular expressions to identify and capture the Julia code blocks, which are typically enclosed within triple backticks (```) with \"julia\" or similar keywords.\n2. Remove the code fences from the captured groups.\n3. Join the extracted code blocks into a single string with newlines separating them.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks using the regex\n    matches = eachmatch(regex, md)\n    \n    # Remove the fences and join code blocks\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the extracted blocks with newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check the solution:\n\n- We are correctly using a regex to match code fences specific to Julia.\n- The code uses array comprehension to collect the captured groups into an array.\n- Finally, we join the code blocks with `join` using a newline separator.\n\nThis implementation should correctly extract and return the Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[337,292],"elapsed":2.831813667,"cost":0.00022574999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1418936881,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
