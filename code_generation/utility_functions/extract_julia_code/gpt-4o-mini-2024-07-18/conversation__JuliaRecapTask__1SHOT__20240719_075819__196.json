[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's how I will approach it:\n\n1. **Recall Useful Julia Snippets:**\n   - To manipulate strings, I can use functions like `split`, `join`, and `replace`.\n   - Regular expressions will be useful for identifying code fences (```).\n   \n2. **Define the Function:**\n   - I'll define a function named `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown string as input.\n   - The function will use a regular expression to find Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and then join the extracted code blocks together with a newline.\n\n3. **Verify Solution:**\n   - Ensure the function accurately identifies, extracts, and formats the Julia code snippets.\n\nNow I will implement the function following these guidelines.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use a regex to match code fences for code blocks in Julia\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the code content and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    extracted_code = [strip(m.match[1]) for m in code_blocks]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newline\n    return join(extracted_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, I will double-check the solution's correctness:\n- It uses a regular expression to match segments enclosed within triple backticks for Julia code.\n- The `matchall` function returns all occurrences, which are then processed in a comprehension to strip excess whitespace. \n- Finally, it joins the pieces with a newline which meets the requirements.\n\nThe function should correctly extract and combine Julia code blocks from the input markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[337,356],"elapsed":4.857322,"cost":0.00026415,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1229060138,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
