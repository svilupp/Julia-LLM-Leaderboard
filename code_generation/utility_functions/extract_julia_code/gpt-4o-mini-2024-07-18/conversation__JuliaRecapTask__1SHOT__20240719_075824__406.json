[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Use regular expressions to find code blocks enclosed by triple backticks (```) that indicate the start and end of code sections.\n2. Remove the code fences (` ``` `) from the found code blocks.\n3. Join the extracted code blocks together with newline characters.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\s*(.*?)```\"\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks using the regex pattern\n    code_blocks = match.(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Filter and join the found code blocks\n    extracted_code = join(filter(x -> x !== nothing, map(x -> x.match, code_blocks)), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check the solution:\n\n- We properly define the function to take an `AbstractString` as input and return an `AbstractString`.\n- We utilize a regular expression to handle the specific format of the markdown code blocks.\n- The extraction is done with careful handling of matched groups.\n- Filtering ensures that we only consider valid matches, avoiding any `nothing` entries.\n- Code blocks are concatenated with newline characters.\n\nThis ensures clarity and performance while adhering to the requirements specified.","status":200,"tokens":[337,300],"elapsed":5.110561333,"cost":0.00023055,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1067938609,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
