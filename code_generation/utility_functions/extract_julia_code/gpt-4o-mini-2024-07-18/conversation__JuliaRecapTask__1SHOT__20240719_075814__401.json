[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use regular expressions to find the code blocks enclosed within specific code fence markers (```` ``` ````).\n2. Remove the code fence markers from the matched strings.\n3. Join the extracted code blocks together, using a newline as a separator.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use a regex to find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md) do m\n        return m.match\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the code, remove any surrounding whitespace, and join with newlines\n    return join(strip.(map(x -> replace(x, r\"```julia|\\s*```\" => \"\"), code_blocks)), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Steps Explained:\n- `matchall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md)` finds all instances of Julia code blocks in the markdown string.\n- `replace(x, r\"```julia|\\s*```\" => \"\")` removes the code fences from each block.\n- `strip.` ensures that any leading or trailing whitespace is removed from the extracted code.\n- `join(..., \"\\n\")` combines all the cleaned code snippets into a single string with newlines in between.\n\nNow, we should double-check that the solution follows the specified requirements correctly and handles various scenarios, such as multiple code blocks or code blocks without the specific language tag. This function is built to handle standard markdown code fences appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[337,333],"elapsed":3.156210625,"cost":0.00025035,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2040923923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
