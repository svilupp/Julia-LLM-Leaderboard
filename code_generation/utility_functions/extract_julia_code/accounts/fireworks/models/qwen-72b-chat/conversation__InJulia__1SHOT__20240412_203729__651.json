It then removes the code fences from each code block and joins the resulting blocks together with a newline. The resulting code is returned as a string.<|im_end|>\n<|endoftext|>","status":200,"tokens":[83,194],"elapsed":3.751546209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":936032236,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
