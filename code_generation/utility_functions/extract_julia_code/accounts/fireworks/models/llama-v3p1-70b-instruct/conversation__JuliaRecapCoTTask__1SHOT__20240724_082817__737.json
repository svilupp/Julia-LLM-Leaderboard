[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If there are any special instructions, I would need to know them to adjust my solution accordingly.\n\nHere is an updated version of the solution using the `eachmatch` function in Julia to iterate over the matches of the pattern in the markdown document. This version of the solution does not use the `matchall` function which returns an array of the entire match, but instead uses the `eachmatch` function which allows us to iterate over the matches and access the capture groups directly.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the code\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Append the code block to the julia_code string with a newline\n        julia_code *= match.captures[1] * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    # Return the string of all the code blocks joined together with a newline\n    return julia_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[342,396],"elapsed":3.550239458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-645648451,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
