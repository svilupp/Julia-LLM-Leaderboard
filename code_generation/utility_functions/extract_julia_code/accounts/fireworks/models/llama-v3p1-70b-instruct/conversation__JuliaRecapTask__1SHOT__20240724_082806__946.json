[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The pattern ````julia[\\s\\S]*?```` matches the code fences and everything in between, including newlines (due to the `[\\s\\S]*?` part, which matches any character, including newlines, in a non-greedy manner). The `findall` function returns a vector of matches.\n\nThe function then removes the code fences from each code block by slicing the string, and finally joins the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[341,282],"elapsed":2.773896708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":194753329,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
