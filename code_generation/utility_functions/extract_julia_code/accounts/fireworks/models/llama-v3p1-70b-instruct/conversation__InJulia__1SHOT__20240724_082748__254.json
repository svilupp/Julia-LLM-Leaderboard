The `matchall` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the document. The code blocks are then extracted from the matches and joined together with a newline character if there are multiple. Finally, the extracted code is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[84,198],"elapsed":2.017752209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":339701920,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
