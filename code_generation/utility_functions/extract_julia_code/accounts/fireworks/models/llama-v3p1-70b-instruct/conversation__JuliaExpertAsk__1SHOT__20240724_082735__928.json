Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for block in Markdown.parse(md)\n        if isa(block, Markdown.Code)\n            if startswith(block.code, \"julia\")\n                push!(code_blocks, strip(block.code, ['\\n', 'j', 'u', 'l', 'i', 'a']))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the Markdown.jl package to parse the markdown document. It iterates over each block in the markdown document and checks if it's a code block. If it's a Julia code block, it removes the 'julia' language specifier and any leading or trailing whitespace, then adds it to the list of code blocks. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newlines and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[119,182],"elapsed":1.815730583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1541961086,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
