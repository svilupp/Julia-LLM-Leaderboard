The regular expression pattern looks for a code block that starts with '```julia' and ends with '```'. The findall function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the join function.","status":200,"tokens":[84,324],"elapsed":2.770975583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1159150237,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
