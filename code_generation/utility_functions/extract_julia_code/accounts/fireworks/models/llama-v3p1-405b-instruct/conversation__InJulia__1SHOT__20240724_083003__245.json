When it encounters a \"```julia\" line, it starts building a code block. When it encounters a \"```\" line after a \"```julia\" line, it ends the code block and adds it to a list of code blocks. If there's still a code block when the end of the document is reached, it adds that block to the list as well. Finally, it joins all the code blocks with newlines in between.","status":200,"tokens":[84,254],"elapsed":10.951215,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2076425544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
