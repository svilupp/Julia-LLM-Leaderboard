[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Specifically, I'll use the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of julia code blocks in the markdown document, and then process these matches to remove code fences and join them together.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match julia code blocks\n    re = r\"```julia(?:\\n|)(.*?)(?:\\n|)```\"s\n\n    # Find all julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = matchall(re, md)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, let's consider what the function is doing:\n\n- The regular expression `re` is designed to match julia code blocks in the markdown document, including the code fences.\n- The `matchall` function finds all occurrences of these code blocks in the document.\n- The code blocks are then processed to remove the code fences by extracting the first capture group from each match (which corresponds to the code inside the fences).\n- Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline to form a single string.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    re = r\"```julia(?:\\n|)(.*?)(?:\\n|)```\"s\n    matches = matchall(re, md)\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[341,401],"elapsed":12.90537775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1205477816,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
