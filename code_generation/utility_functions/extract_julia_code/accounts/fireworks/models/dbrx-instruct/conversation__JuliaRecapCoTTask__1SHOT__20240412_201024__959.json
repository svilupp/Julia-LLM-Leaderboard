[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the special instructions provided, I would suggest the following solution for the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"\\n```\")[2:end]\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"julia\")\n            block = strip(block, ['`', 'julia'])\n            julia_code *= block * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an `AbstractString` as input and returns a String as output. It first splits the markdown document by the code fence delimiter `\"` to get an array of code blocks. Then, it filters out the non-Julia code blocks by checking if the block starts with the string \"julia\". If it does, the function removes the code fence and appends the code block","status":200,"tokens":[341,200],"elapsed":5.105872625,"cost":0.0008655999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-443416130,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
