It iterates through each element in the markdown content, checking if it is a `Markdown.Code` object with the language set to \"julia\". If it is, the code block is added to a `code_blocks` array. After checking all elements, the function returns a single string by joining all the code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[83,174],"elapsed":3.02766375,"cost":0.0004112,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1774871058,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
