[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

First, we need to read the markdown document and extract the code blocks. In Julia, we can use the `readlines` function to read the document into an array of strings, where each string is a line in the document.\n2. Next, we can use the `filter` function to extract the lines that start with \"```julia\". These lines contain the code blocks.\n3. After that, we can use the `join` function to join the code blocks together with a newline.\n4. Finally, we can remove the code fences (the \"```julia\" lines) from the resulting string.\n\nHere is the function that implements these steps:\n\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = filter(line -> startswith(line, \"```julia\"), readlines(md))\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove the code","status":200,"tokens":[340,200],"elapsed":4.089222542,"cost":0.000864,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-2012171994,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
