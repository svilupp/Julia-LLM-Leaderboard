The `findcodeblockswithlanguage` function from the `Markdown` package is used to find code blocks that have a language attribute of \"julia\". These code blocks are then iterated over, code fences are removed, leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, and the code blocks are joined together with newline characters. The resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[84,194],"elapsed":0.824117,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1368145219,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
