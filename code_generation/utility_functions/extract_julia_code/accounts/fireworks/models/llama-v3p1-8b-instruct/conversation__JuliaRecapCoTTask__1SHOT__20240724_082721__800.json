[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The function first extracts all code blocks from the markdown document using the `extract_code_blocks` function. It then filters these blocks to only include the ones that are Julia code. It removes the code fences from these blocks and joins them together with newlines. The resulting Julia code is then returned as a string.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the markdown document is represented as a string, and that it uses the `readmd` function from the Julia Markdown package to parse the markdown document into an array of blocks. The `extract_code_blocks` function uses regular expressions to extract code blocks from each block in this array.","status":200,"tokens":[342,331],"elapsed":1.217486333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":573997434,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
