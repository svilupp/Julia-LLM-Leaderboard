The pattern `r\"\\`{3}(.*?)\\`{3}|```(.*?)```\"` matches both julia code blocks with three double backticks and code blocks with three double backticks with interpolation.\n\nThe `extractall` function is used to extract all matches of the pattern in the markdown document. The extracted matches are stored in the `code_blocks` array.\n\nSince we only want the code blocks without the code fences, we use indexing to extract the second element of each match (index 1) from the array `code_blocks`. The second element is the code block without the code fences.\n\nFinally, we use the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks with a newline. The result is a string containing all the julia code blocks joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[84,301],"elapsed":1.3523115,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-927249127,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
