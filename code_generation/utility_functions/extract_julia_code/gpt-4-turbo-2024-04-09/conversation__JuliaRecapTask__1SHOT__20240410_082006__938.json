[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

In this context, a regex pattern will be helpful to identify Julia code blocks within markdown, usually marked within triple backticks followed by `julia` (e.g., ```` ```julia ````).\n\n3. **Text Parsing Strategy:** \n   - Identify the starting and ending of the Julia code blocks. \n   - Extract content within these blocks.\n   - Join multiple blocks of code, separating them with a newline character if needed.\n\n4. **Returning the Result:** Prepare and string output of the joined code blocks for the return value.\n\nImplementing the above steps involves defining a function `extract_julia_code` that takes the markdown content, uses regex for text extraction, and processes & concatenates the results neatly.
