Each block of code will be separated by a newline.\n5. **Return Result:** Produce and return the final consolidated string or an empty string if no code blocks are found.\n\nThe function should be precise in detecting the specific blocks (not confuse with other languages or malformed blocks) and handle cases where fences might slightly diverge (by spaces or text). \n\nWe will leverage regular expressions for this task for precise extraction and manipulation.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Pattern to match fenced Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)(?:\\n\\s*)*```\"\n    \n    # Extract all Julia code blocks using a capturing group in the regex\n    blocks = matchall(pattern, md, RegexOptions.Singleline)\n    \n    # Each matched block will have leading and trailing backticks and language identifier to remove\n    # The regex capturing group already cater for inner content only\n    if isempty(blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    else\n        # Join all snippets with newlines and return the result\n        return join(blocks, \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[190,349],"elapsed":8.04694525,"cost":0.01237,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1280656919,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
