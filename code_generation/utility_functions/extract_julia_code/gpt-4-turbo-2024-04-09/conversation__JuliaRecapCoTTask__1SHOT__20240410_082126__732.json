[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem of extracting Julia language code blocks from a markdown document, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: In markdown, code blocks are enclosed in \"fences\" which are typically three backticks (```). A specific language can be identified immediately after the initial backticks, for instance, for Julia it might appear as ```julia`.\n\n2. **Parse the Document**: Traverse through the markdown document to find sequences that start with ```julia and end with ```. Extract the enclosed text.\n\n3. **Cleanup and Combination**: Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted code blocks. If there are multiple Julia code blocks, concatenate them with a newline character separating each.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Convert the final cleaned and combined string for further processing or displaying as required.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regex to match julia code blocks including ```julia fences\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the code section\n    matches = [match[1] for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n\n    # Combine individual code blocks with newline, strip to clean any unintended whitespace\n    combined_code = join(matches, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows the required sequence of identifying Julia code blocks, extracting, cleaning, and combining them as needed to output a single unified string containing all the code. The final result is suitable for execution or display as needed in applications that might need to process or run Julia code extracted from markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[340,335],"elapsed":8.499262666,"cost":0.01345,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-135144819,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
