[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, the approach involves processing the markdown content to identify Julia code blocks and then extracting the code inside those blocks. Julia code blocks in markdown are typically denoted by triple backticks followed by `julia`, like this:\n\n```markdown\n```julia\ncode here\n```\n```\n\nHere's a systematic breakdown of how to perform the task:\n\n1. Recognize the blocks that start with \"```julia\" and end with \"```\".\n2. Extract the content inside these blocks, which contains the Julia code.\n3. Concatenate all extracted blocks of code with a newline character `\\n` separating them.\n4. Ensure that the output is a single string with all the code together.\n\nFor this, regular expressions can be helpful in matching the specific patterns. In Julia, we'll use the `match` and `eachmatch` functions from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of the specified pattern, capturing the Julia code blocks. Then, the `join` function can concatenate all the extracted blocks into one string with the necessary formatting.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Pattern to find the julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```$\"\n    \n    # Extract all matches with the pattern and group number 1 (the code block)\n    matches = eachmatch(Regex(pattern, \"ms\"), md)\n    \n    # Extract code from matches and join them with newline\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis basic function covers the requirements by:\n- Using regex to find and extract only the blocks of code labeled as Julia.\n- Appropriately joining all such blocks with newline characters for proper formatting.\n- Handling the string inputs as specified and enforcing the return type as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[339,389],"elapsed":9.392802041,"cost":0.01506,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1096668655,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
