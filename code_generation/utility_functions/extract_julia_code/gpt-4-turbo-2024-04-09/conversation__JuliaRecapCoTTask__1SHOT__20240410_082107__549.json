[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The task requires extracting these blocks.\n\n2. **Extract Content**: Once identified, we must capture the content between these fences, ignoring the fence lines themselves.\n\n3. **Join Multiple Blocks**: If there are multiple code blocks, they should be joined together separated by a newline.\n\n4. **Return Result**: A single string constructed by joining these blocks should be returned.\n\nNext, we proceed to implement the function based on these outlined steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Pattern to capture Julia fenced code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Extract all matches and the actual Julia code between fences\n    matches = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n    \n    # Join extracted code blocks with new line\n    joined_code = join(matches, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[340,237],"elapsed":5.647095291,"cost":0.01051,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1708870883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
