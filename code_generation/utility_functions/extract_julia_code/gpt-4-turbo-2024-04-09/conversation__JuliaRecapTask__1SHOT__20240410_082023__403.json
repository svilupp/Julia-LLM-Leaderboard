[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n1. **Identify Code Blocks**: In markdown, code blocks are marked with triple backticks (```). Julia code blocks will typically be identifiable when they are followed by the language identifier \"julia\", like this: ```julia.\n\n2. **Extract Content**: Once found, the content inside these fences (between ```julia and ```) will be extracted.\n\n3. **Join Multiple Blocks**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, their contents need to be concatenated, separated by a newline.\n\nThe regex method can effectively manage the identification and extraction of these blocks.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Using regular expression to find all occurrences of julia fenced code blocks\n    # The pattern looks for triple backticks, the word julia, and then captures everything\n    # until it finds the closing triple backticks.\n    julia_code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    \n    # Join all captured code blocks separated by a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that each code block starts with ```julia and ends with ``` both on their own lines, with the code in between. The `r\" ... \"` constructs a regex pattern, the `s` after the pattern allows the `.` to match newlines (dotall mode), ensuring that multiline code is captured. Each block's content is captured in a non-greedy manner (`.*?`) ensuring only the content inside a single set of fences is matched. The `join` function then combines these matches into a single string, delimited by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[339,359],"elapsed":7.477513958,"cost":0.01416,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":552855573,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
