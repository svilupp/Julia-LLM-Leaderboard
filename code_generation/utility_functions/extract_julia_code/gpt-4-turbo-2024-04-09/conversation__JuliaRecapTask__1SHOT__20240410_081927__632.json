[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Specifically, Julia code blocks start with `` ```julia ``. \n   \n2. **Processing Code Blocks:**\n    - Strip out the markdown code fences specifically for Julia, i.e., remove the starting `` ```julia `` and the ending ` ``` `.\n    - Separate multiple Julia code snippets using a newline (`\\n`).\n\n3. **Concatenate the Processed Blocks:** All cleaned blocks should be concatenated together, again separated by newlines if there are multiple blocks.\n\nThe function needs to ensure the manipulation and extraction are done efficiently and accurately for any given markdown input.
