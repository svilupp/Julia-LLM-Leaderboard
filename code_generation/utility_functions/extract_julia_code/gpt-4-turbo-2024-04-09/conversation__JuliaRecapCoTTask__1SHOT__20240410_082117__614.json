[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Optionally, they can be annotated with the language (e.g., ```julia for Julia code blocks).\n\n2. **Extract Julia Code Blocks**: Use a regex pattern to specifically extract blocks annotated as Julia code blocks.\n\n3. **Clean and Compile Code**: Remove the code fences and any leading/trailing whitespace around the code itself.\n\n4. **Join Extracted Code Blocks**: If multiple Julia code blocks exist, join them together with a newline character to separate them.\n\n5. **Return the Combined Code String**: The final output should be a string containing the unified code snippets without the fences but preserving the internal code structure and ordering.\n\nWe can accomplish this by using Julia's regex capabilities (`match`, `eachmatch` from the standard library) to find all Julia code blocks and then process them as described above. This approach ensures that only code specifically denoted to be in Julia is extracted, keeping the function focused and accurate according to markdown standards for code blocks.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regex to capture julia code blocks\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Extracting all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_code_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code segments from the matches, stripping any extraneous whitespace\n    code_blocks = [strip(match.captures[1]) for match in matches]\n\n    # Joining all code blocks with a newline in between\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[340,368],"elapsed":10.055711,"cost":0.01444,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2128199488,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
