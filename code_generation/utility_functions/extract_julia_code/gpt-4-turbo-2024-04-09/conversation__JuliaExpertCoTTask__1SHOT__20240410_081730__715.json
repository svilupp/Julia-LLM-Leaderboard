Gather these segments into a single string separated by newlines.\n\n3. **Implementing the Solution**: Using Julia's string manipulation and regex capabilities to capture code within the blocks and join them into a resultant string.\n\n4. **Test the Code**: Internally verify the edge cases like single block, multiple blocks, and no blocks present.\n\nHere is the function implementation based on these steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to find Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_regex = r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Extract all matches\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_regex, md)\n    \n    # If matches are found, concatenate them with a newline between each.\n    if length(matches) > 0\n        code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n        return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[190,273],"elapsed":6.950018792,"cost":0.01009,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-687956951,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
