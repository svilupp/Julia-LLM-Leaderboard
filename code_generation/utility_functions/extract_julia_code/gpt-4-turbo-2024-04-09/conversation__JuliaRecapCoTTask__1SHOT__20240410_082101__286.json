X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

They typically appear in markdown fenced by triple backticks, with an optional language identifier.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - I will use a regex to find blocks that are fenced by triple backticks followed by 'julia'.\n   - Once Julia code blocks are identified, I need to remove the code fences (` ```julia ` and ` ``` `).\n   - If there are multiple Julia code blocks, they will be concatenated together with a newline separating each block.\n   - Return the resultant string.\n  \n3. **Double-check the Solution**:\n   - Iâ€™ll ensure regex captures the exact blocks without omitting or leaking into non-fenced content.\n   - Ensure all fences are removed properly, and multiple blocks are joined correctly.\n\nHere is a solution fulfilling all these steps and guidelines:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to capture Julia fenced code blocks\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(julia_code_pattern, md)]\n    \n    # Join matches with a newline to form the final code\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[340,300],"elapsed":12.035939709,"cost":0.012400000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1286161856,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
