This pattern recognizes blocks of code that are enclosed by triple backticks (\\`\\`\\`) followed by an identifier for julia (`julia`).\n\n2. **Extraction**: Use Juliaâ€™s regex capabilities (`match` and `Regex`) to find and extract the contents of all these identified code blocks.\n\n3. **Processing**: Remove the leading and trailing code fences from the matched content and collect the code into a list.\n\n4. **Concatenation**: Concatenate the code snippets from all extracted blocks, separating them using a newline character, to ensure proper spacing and organization of the code.\n\n5. **Return**: Return the final concatenated string that stitches together all the Julia code blocks.\n\nHere's the proposed function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base: eachmatch\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define the regex pattern to capture julia code blocks\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(julia_code_pattern, md)]\n    # Concatenate all captured code blocks separated by newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[190,273],"elapsed":6.012287583,"cost":0.01009,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-882587326,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
