[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This looks like:\n   `\\```julia`\n   `code here`\n   `\\````\n   \n2. **Extract Code**: Search through the markdown document to locate these blocks and extract the code between the starting `\\```julia` and ending `\\````.\n\n3. **Remove Code Fences**: Strip the code fences from the extracted segments.\n\n4. **Combine Code**: If multiple Julia code blocks are present, join them together using a newline character as a separator, ensuring a clear and clean result for multiple blocks.\n\n5. **Return Result**: Format and return all concatenated code as a single string.\n\nLet's implement this in the solution using Julia's string manipulation and the regex features to identify and extract the requisite code segments effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[339,192],"elapsed":4.198177542,"cost":0.00915,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-327926928,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
