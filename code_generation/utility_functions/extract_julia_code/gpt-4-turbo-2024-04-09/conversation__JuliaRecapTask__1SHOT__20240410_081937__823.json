[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we will follow these outlined steps:\n\n1. **Extract Code Blocks**: We will identify Julia code blocks from the markdown text. These blocks are typically surrounded by triple backticks (```) followed by an optional language identifier. For our purpose, we are interested in those which are identified with `julia`.\n\n2. **Remove Code Fences**: Once the blocks are extracted, we need to remove the three backticks and any immediate identifier or attributes.\n\n3. **Join Code Blocks**: If there is more than one Julia block, we will need to concatenate these blocks into a single string, each separated by a newline.\n\nSince there are no specific special instructions regarding language constraints or performance optimizations, I will leverage basic string operations and Juliaâ€™s in-built functions to perform the mentioned steps succinctly. By using regular expressions, we can efficiently capture and manipulate the required portions of the markdown.\n\nLet's now proceed to create the `extract_julia_code` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # This regular expression matches the julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia[\\s\\S]*?```\"\n    \n    # Extract all julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = eachmatch(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Initialize a list to hold processed code blocks\n    processed_blocks = []\n    \n    # Process each code block\n    for block in julia_code_blocks\n        # Extract the content of the code block (remove the fences)\n        content = block.match[4:end-4]  # slicing to remove the surrounding ```julia``` and ```\n        \n        # Trim additional spaces or newlines\n        content = strip(content)\n        \n        # Append to the list\n        push!(processed_blocks, content)\n    end\n    \n    # Join the processed blocks with a newline\n    result_code = join(processed_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return result_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function leverages regular expressions to identify Julia code blocks, extracts their contents after removing the identifying backticks and language identifier, and then joins them with newlines if required. This solution handles basic cases while keeping the original format of the code written within the blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[339,461],"elapsed":10.155331458,"cost":0.01722,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1986310264,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
