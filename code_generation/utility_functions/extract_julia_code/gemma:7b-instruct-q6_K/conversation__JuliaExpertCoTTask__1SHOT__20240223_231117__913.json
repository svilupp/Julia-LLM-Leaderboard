[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nextract_julia_code(md) = replaceall(md, \"```julia\\n\", \"\")  # Remove code fences\nextract_julia_code(md) = join(split(extract_julia_code(md), \"\\n\"), \"\\n\")  # Join code blocks with a newline\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document `md` as input.\n- It removes all code fences (````julia\\n`) using `replaceall`.\n- It splits the remaining text into code blocks based on newlines and joins them together with a newline using `join` and `split`.\n- Finally, it returns a string containing the extracted code blocks.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown document `md` contains Julia code blocks. It does not handle other types of code blocks or markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[179,187],"elapsed":13.247373,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-32524,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
