Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nextract_julia_code(md) = join(split(md, \"```julia\")'[1:end-1], \"\\n\")\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document `md` as input.\n- It uses the `split` function to split the document into code blocks enclosed by \"```julia\".\n- It removes the first and last elements of the resulting list, which are the code fences.\n- It joins the remaining code blocks together with a newline.\n- Finally, it returns a string.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- This function assumes that the markdown document has code blocks enclosed by \"```julia\".\n- It does not handle any other types of code blocks or markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":10.589641458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":18903,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
