It is concise and precise, as it avoids unnecessary steps and uses the appropriate Julia syntax for extracting and manipulating the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":13.358340834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":17654,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
