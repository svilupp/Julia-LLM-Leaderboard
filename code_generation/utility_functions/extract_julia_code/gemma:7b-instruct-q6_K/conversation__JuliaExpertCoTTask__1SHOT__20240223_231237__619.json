It uses the `split` function to divide the markdown document into code blocks, removes the code fences and joins the remaining code blocks together with a newline. The `strip` function is used to remove unnecessary whitespace and the `\\n` character is added at the end of each code block to ensure proper formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":10.880997917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":30925,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
