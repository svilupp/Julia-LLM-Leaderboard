[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your instructions, here is the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif occursin(\"```\", line)\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, chomp(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts a Julia code block (```julia), it sets a flag `in_code_block` to `true`. If it encounters a line that ends a code block (```), it sets the flag to `false`. While the flag is `true`, it adds the line (with the trailing newline character removed) to the `code_blocks` array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[402,309],"elapsed":8.865727375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":298740400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
