[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If it does, the function sets a flag to indicate that we are inside a code block and removes the code fence from the line. If the line does not start with a code fence but we are inside a code block, the function removes any leading whitespace from the line and appends it to the code string. If we reach a line with three backticks and we are inside a code block, this means we have reached the end of the block, so the function sets the flag to false and removes the code fence from the line.\n\nThe function returns the extracted code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[400,671],"elapsed":15.2015375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-398422510,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
