It then filters out the code blocks that are written in Julia and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is returned.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are written in the standard markdown format, with three backticks (```) and the language name (`julia`) on the first line. If the code blocks are written in a different format, this function may not work correctly.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle code blocks that span multiple lines. If you have code blocks that span multiple lines, you may need to modify this function to handle them correctly.\n\nFinally, this function does not handle code blocks that contain special characters, such as backticks or asterisks.
