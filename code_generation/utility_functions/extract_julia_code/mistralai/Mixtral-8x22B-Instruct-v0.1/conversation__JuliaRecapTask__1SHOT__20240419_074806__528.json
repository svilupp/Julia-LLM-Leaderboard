[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

If it does, the function sets a boolean flag to indicate whether we are inside a code block or not. If we are inside a code block, the function appends the line to the extracted code, after removing the code fence. If we are not inside a code block, the function ignores the line.\n\nThe function also checks if a line starts with just three backticks, which indicates the end of a code block. If we are inside a code block and we encounter such a line, the function appends a newline to the extracted code and sets the flag to false to indicate that we are no longer inside a code block.\n\nFinally, the function removes any leading or trailing newlines from the extracted code and returns it as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[400,683],"elapsed":31.167947083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1844963942,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
