It then filters out the code blocks that are written in Julia and joins them together with a newline. The resulting string is returned.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `Markdown` package installed in your Julia environment to use this function. You can install it by running `]add Markdown` in the Julia REPL.\n\nAlso, this function assumes that the code blocks are written in the standard markdown format, i.e., they are enclosed in triple backticks (```) and the language is specified after the first set of backticks. If the code blocks are written in a different format, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[93,278],"elapsed":9.410683292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1932474441,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
