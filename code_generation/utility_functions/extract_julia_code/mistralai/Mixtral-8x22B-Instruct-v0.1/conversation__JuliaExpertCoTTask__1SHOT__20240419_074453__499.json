If it does, the function toggles a boolean flag to indicate whether we are inside a code block. If we are inside a code block, the function removes the code fence and adds the line to the extracted code. Finally, the function returns the extracted code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[228,415],"elapsed":6.888462209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-74736091,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
