Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif occursin(\"```\", line)\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, chomp(line))\n        end\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown document and checking if it starts a Julia code block (````julia`) or ends a code block (````). If it's inside a code block, it removes the code fences and appends the line to a list of code blocks. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[134,244],"elapsed":22.178746666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-596600304,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
