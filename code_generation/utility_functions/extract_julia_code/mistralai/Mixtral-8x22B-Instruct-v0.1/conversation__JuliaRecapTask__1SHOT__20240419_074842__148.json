[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It uses a boolean flag to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not, and it uses the `startswith` function to check if a line starts with a code fence. If a line starts with a code fence, the function removes the code fence and either sets the flag to true (if the code fence indicates the start of a code block) or false (if the code fence indicates the end of a code block). If we are inside a code block and the line does not start with a code fence, the function removes any leading whitespace from the line and adds it to the extracted code. Finally, the function returns the extracted code.","status":200,"tokens":[400,632],"elapsed":26.9976985,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1507537572,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
