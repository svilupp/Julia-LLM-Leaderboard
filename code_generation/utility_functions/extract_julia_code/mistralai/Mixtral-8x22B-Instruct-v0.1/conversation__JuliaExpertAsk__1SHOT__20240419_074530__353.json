Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"```julia\", line)\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif occursin(\"```\", line)\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, chomp(line))\n        end\n    end\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown document and checking if it starts a Julia code block (i.e., if it contains the string \"```julia\"). If it does, the function sets a flag `in_code_block` to `true` and starts collecting the lines of the code block into a list. If a line ends a code block (i.e., if it contains the string \"```\"), the function sets `in_code_block` to `false` and stops collecting lines. Finally, the function joins all the collected lines together with a newline character and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[134,288],"elapsed":6.994790458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1185527339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
