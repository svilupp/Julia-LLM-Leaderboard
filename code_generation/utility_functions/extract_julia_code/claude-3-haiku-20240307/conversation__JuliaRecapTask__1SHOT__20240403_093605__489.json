[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    current_block = \"\"\n    reading_code = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            reading_code = true\n        elseif line == \"```\"\n            reading_code = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"\n        elseif reading_code\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks and an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being built.\n2. Iterate through each line of the input Markdown document `md`.\n3. If the current line starts with `\"```julia\"`, it indicates the start of a code block, so we set `reading_code` to `true`.\n4. If the current line is `\"```\"`, it indicates the end of the code block, so we push the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array and reset `current_block` to an empty string. We also set `reading_code` to `false`.\n5. If `reading_code` is `true`, we append the current line to the `current_block` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. Finally, we join all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character and return the result.\n\nThis function should correctly extract and join all the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[367,416],"elapsed":4.333432459,"cost":0.0006117500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
