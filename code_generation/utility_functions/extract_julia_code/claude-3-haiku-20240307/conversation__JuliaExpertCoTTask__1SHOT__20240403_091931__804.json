It then iterates through the lines, and whenever it encounters the start of a code block (indicated by the line starting with \"```julia\"), it collects all the lines until the end of the code block (indicated by a line starting with \"```\"). The collected code block is then added to the `julia_code` array. Finally, the function joins all the Julia code blocks with a newline and returns the result as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[198,407],"elapsed":3.901517333,"cost":0.00055825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27702,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
