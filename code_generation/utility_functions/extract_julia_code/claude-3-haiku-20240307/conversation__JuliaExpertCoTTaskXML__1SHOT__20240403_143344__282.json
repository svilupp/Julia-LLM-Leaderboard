It then reads the lines until the end of the code block (marked by \"```\"), and appends them to the `julia_code` string. Finally, it returns the extracted Julia code.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")\n```\n\nThis should return the string `\"println(\"hello world\")\\n\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[232,406],"elapsed":3.85458825,"cost":0.0005655,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21969,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
