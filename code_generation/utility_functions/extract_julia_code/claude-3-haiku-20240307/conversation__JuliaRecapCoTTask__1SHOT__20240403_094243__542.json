[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It initializes two variables: `julia_code_blocks` to store the extracted Julia code blocks, and `current_block` to store the current code block being built.\n2. It iterates through each line of the input markdown document (`md`).\n3. If the current line starts with \"```julia\", it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `true`, indicating that the following lines are part of a Julia code block.\n4. If the current line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `false`, meaning the current code block has ended. If there is a non-empty `current_block`, it is added to the `julia_code_blocks` array.\n5. If `in_code_block` is `true`, the current line is appended to the `current_block` string, with a newline character.\n6. After the loop, if there is a non-empty `current_block`, it is added to the `julia_code_blocks` array.\n7. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks in the `julia_code_blocks` array with a newline and returns the resulting String.","status":200,"tokens":[368,552],"elapsed":4.862411833,"cost":0.000782,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20532,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
