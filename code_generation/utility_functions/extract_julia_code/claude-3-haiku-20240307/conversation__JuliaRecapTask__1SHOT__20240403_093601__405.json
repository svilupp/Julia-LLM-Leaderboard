[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that extracts all the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the Markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the Julia code blocks\n    julia_code = String[]\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    is_julia_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            is_julia_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            is_julia_block = false\n        elseif is_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join the Julia code blocks into a single string\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The Markdown document is split into lines using the `split` function.\n2. An empty array `julia_code` is initialized to store the Julia code blocks.\n3. The function iterates through the lines of the Markdown document.\n4. If a line starts with `\"```julia\"`, it means the start of a Julia code block, so the `is_julia_block` flag is set to `true`.\n5. If a line starts with `\"```\"` (without \"julia\"), it means the end of a Julia code block, so the `is_julia_block` flag is set to `false`.\n6. If the `is_julia_block` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `julia_code` array.\n7. After the loop, the Julia code blocks in the `julia_code` array are joined into a single string using the `join` function.\n\nThe function assumes that the Markdown document contains at least one Julia code block. If the Markdown document does not contain any Julia code blocks, the function will return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,447],"elapsed":4.029545209,"cost":0.0006505,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29695,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
