[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Initialize an empty array `julia_blocks` to store the extracted Julia code blocks, and an empty string `current_block` to accumulate the current code block.\n2. Iterate through the lines of the input Markdown document.\n3. If the line starts with `\"```julia\"`, set `in_julia_block` to `true` to indicate that a Julia code block has started.\n4. If the line starts with `\"```\"` (but not `\"```julia\"`), it means the current Julia code block has ended, so push the `current_block` to the `julia_blocks` array and reset `current_block` and `in_julia_block`.\n5. If `in_julia_block` is `true`, append the current line (with a newline character) to the `current_block`.\n6. After the loop, if `current_block` is not empty, push it to the `julia_blocks` array.\n7. Finally, join all the Julia code blocks in the `julia_blocks` array with a newline character and return the result.\n\nThis function should work for any Markdown document that contains Julia code blocks, without the need for any specific examples.","status":200,"tokens":[368,492],"elapsed":4.632370542,"cost":0.0007070000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7422,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
