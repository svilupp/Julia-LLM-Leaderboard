It splits the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the code blocks.\n3. It iterates through the lines, checking if each line starts or ends a code block using the `startswith` function.\n4. If a line starts a code block, it sets a flag `in_code_block` to `true`. If a line ends a code block, it sets the flag to `false`.\n5. If the `in_code_block` flag is `true`, it adds the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n6. Finally, it joins the code blocks in `code_blocks` with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[198,455],"elapsed":4.45762375,"cost":0.00061825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23482,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
