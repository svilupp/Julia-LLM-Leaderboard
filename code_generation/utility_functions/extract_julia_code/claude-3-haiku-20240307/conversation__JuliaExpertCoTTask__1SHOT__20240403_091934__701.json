It then iterates through the lines, looking for code fences that start with \"```julia\". When it finds one, it extracts the code block and adds it to an array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks into a single string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[198,320],"elapsed":3.2006975,"cost":0.00044950000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10105,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
