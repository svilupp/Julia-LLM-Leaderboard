[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    current_block = \"\"\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            current_block = \"\"\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the lines of the Markdown document, looking for the start and end of Julia code blocks. It appends the lines within each code block to the `current_block` variable, and then adds that block to the `code_blocks` array when the end of the block is encountered. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newlines and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the Markdown document only contains Julia code blocks, and not any other types of code blocks. If the document may contain other types of code blocks, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases as well.","status":200,"tokens":[368,324],"elapsed":3.417632125,"cost":0.000497,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24796,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
