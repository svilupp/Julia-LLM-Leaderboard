[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Split the input markdown document `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Initialize an empty array `julia_code` to store the Julia code blocks.\n3. Iterate through the lines:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", set the `in_julia_block` flag to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), set the `in_julia_block` flag to `false`.\n   - If `in_julia_block` is `true`, append the line to the `julia_code` array.\n4. Join the elements of the `julia_code` array with a newline `\"\\n\"` and return the result.\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from the input markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[198,399],"elapsed":3.421615542,"cost":0.00054825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30174,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
