[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty StringBuilder to collect the Julia code\n    julia_code = StringBuilder()\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts a code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Check if the line ends a code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we're in a code block, append the line to the StringBuilder\n        if in_code_block\n            println(julia_code, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Convert the StringBuilder to a String and return it\n    return String(take!(julia_code))\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. It splits the input markdown document `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. It initializes an empty `StringBuilder` object to collect the Julia code.\n3. It iterates through the lines of the markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `true` to indicate that we've entered a Julia code block.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (but doesn't contain \"julia\"), it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `false` to indicate that we've exited a code block.\n   - If we're in a code block (i.e., `in_code_block` is `true`), it appends the line to the `StringBuilder` using `println(julia_code, line)`.\n4. Finally, it converts the `StringBuilder` to a `String` using `String(take!(julia_code))` and returns the result.\n\nThis function should extract all the Julia code blocks from the input markdown document and return them as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,499],"elapsed":4.370873541,"cost":0.0007155000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10549,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
