Whenever it encounters the start of a code block (````julia`), it sets a flag to indicate that it is inside a Julia code block. It then collects the lines of the code block into a temporary string variable `current_block`. When it encounters the end of the code block (`````), it adds the `current_block` to a list of code blocks and resets the `current_block` and `in_julia_block` variables.\n\nFinally, if there is any remaining code in the `current_block`, it is added to the list of code blocks, and the function returns the joined list of code blocks as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,415],"elapsed":4.01150875,"cost":0.00053875,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17607,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
