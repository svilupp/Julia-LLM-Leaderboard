[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the Markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted Julia code\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    # Flag to track if we are inside a Julia code block\n    in_julia_block = false\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n        # Check if the line ends a Julia code block\n        elseif line == \"```\"\n            in_julia_block = false\n        # If we are inside a Julia code block, append the line to the julia_code string\n        elseif in_julia_block\n            julia_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. The Markdown document is split into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. An empty string `julia_code` is initialized to store the extracted Julia code.\n3. A flag `in_julia_block` is used to track whether the current line is inside a Julia code block.\n4. The function iterates through the lines of the Markdown document:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets the `in_julia_block` flag to `true`, indicating the start of a Julia code block.\n   - If the line is \"```\", it sets the `in_julia_block` flag to `false`, indicating the end of a Julia code block.\n   - If the `in_julia_block` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `julia_code` string with a newline character.\n5. Finally, the function returns the `julia_code` string, which contains all the Julia code blocks combined.","status":200,"tokens":[368,467],"elapsed":4.48681575,"cost":0.00067575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19866,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
