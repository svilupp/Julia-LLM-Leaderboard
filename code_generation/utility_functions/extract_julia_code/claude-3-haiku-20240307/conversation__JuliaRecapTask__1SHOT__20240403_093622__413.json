[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` regular expression is used to find all the code blocks in the Markdown document. The `DOTALL` flag is used to make the `.` match newlines as well.\n2. The `eachmatch` function is used to find all the matches, and the `collect` function is used to gather them into an array.\n3. The `map` function is used to extract the code from each block (the first capture group in the regex), and the `join` function is used to join them with newlines.\n\nThe function returns the extracted Julia code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,284],"elapsed":3.288079875,"cost":0.00044675,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
