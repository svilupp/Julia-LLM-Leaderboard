[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We first split the markdown document into individual lines using the `split()` function.\n2. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. We iterate through the lines, keeping track of whether we're currently inside a code block or not (`in_code_block` variable).\n4. If we encounter the start of a code block (i.e., a line starting with \"```julia\"), we set `in_code_block` to `true` and continue to the next line.\n5. If we encounter the end of a code block (i.e., a line starting with \"```\"), we set `in_code_block` to `false`, add the current block to the `code_blocks` array, and reset the `current_block` variable.\n6. If we're inside a code block, we append the current line to the `current_block` variable.\n7. After iterating through all the lines, we join all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array into a single string and return it.\n\nThe function assumes that the markdown document contains valid code blocks delimited by the \"```julia\" and \"```\" fences. It does not perform any additional validation or error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[367,549],"elapsed":5.13966425,"cost":0.000778,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23169,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
