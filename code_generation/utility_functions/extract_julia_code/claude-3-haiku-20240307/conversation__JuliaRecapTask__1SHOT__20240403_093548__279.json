[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks and an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being processed.\n2. Initialize a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track whether we are currently in a code block or not.\n3. Iterate through each line of the input markdown document `md`.\n4. If the current line starts with `\"```julia\"`, set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate that we have entered a Julia code block.\n5. If the current line starts with `\"```\"` (but not `\"```julia\"`), set `in_code_block` to `false` to indicate that we have exited the code block. In this case, append the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n6. If we are currently in a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), append the current line to the `current_block` string, followed by a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n7. After iterating through all the lines, join the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document and return them as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,497],"elapsed":4.814520208,"cost":0.0007130000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
