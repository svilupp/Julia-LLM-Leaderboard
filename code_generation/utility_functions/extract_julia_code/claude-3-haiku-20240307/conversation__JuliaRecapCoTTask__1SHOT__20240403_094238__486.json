[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts the Julia code blocks from the given markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the code blocks\n    code_blocks = String[]\n\n    # Iterate through the lines and extract the Julia code blocks\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_code_block = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif line == \"```\"\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_code_block)\n            current_code_block = \"\"\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks into a single string\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. The markdown document is split into lines using the `split` function.\n2. An empty array `code_blocks` is initialized to store the extracted code blocks.\n3. The function iterates through the lines, keeping track of whether it's currently inside a code block (`in_code_block` flag).\n4. Whenever a \"```julia\" line is encountered, the `in_code_block` flag is set to `true`, and a new code block is started.\n5. Whenever a \"```\" line is encountered, the `in_code_block` flag is set to `false`, and the current code block is added to the `code_blocks` array.\n6. If the function is inside a code block, the current line is appended to the `current_code_block` string.\n7. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks into a single string and returns it.\n\nThe function does not provide any examples, as per the Special Instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[368,460],"elapsed":4.602324125,"cost":0.0006670000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13684,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
