[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It splits the Markdown document into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. It iterates through the lines, keeping track of whether we're currently in a Julia code block (`in_julia_block`) and the current code block being built (`current_block`).\n3. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_julia_block` to `true` and continues to the next line.\n4. When it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" (but not \"```julia\"), it sets `in_julia_block` to `false`, appends the current block to the `julia_code_blocks` array, and resets `current_block` to an empty string.\n5. If we're in a Julia code block, it appends the current line to `current_block`.\n6. Finally, it joins the Julia code blocks in the `julia_code_blocks` array and returns the result as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,513],"elapsed":6.155681167,"cost":0.000733,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
