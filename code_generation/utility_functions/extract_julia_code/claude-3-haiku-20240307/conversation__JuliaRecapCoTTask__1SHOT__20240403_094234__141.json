[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It splits the input markdown document into individual lines.\n2. It iterates through the lines, checking for the start and end of code blocks.\n3. It collects the lines that are part of the Julia code blocks into an array.\n4. Finally, it joins the collected lines into a single string and returns it.\n\nThe function does not make any assumptions about the input markdown document and should work for any valid document with Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[368,361],"elapsed":3.642837791,"cost":0.00054325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
