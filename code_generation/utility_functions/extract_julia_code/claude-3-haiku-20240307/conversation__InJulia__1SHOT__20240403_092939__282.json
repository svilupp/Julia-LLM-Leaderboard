When a Julia code block is encountered, the lines are collected and added to the `code_blocks` array. Once the end of the block is reached, the collected code is added to the array. Finally, the function joins all the code blocks into a single `String` and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[80,370],"elapsed":3.644610041,"cost":0.0004825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19951,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
