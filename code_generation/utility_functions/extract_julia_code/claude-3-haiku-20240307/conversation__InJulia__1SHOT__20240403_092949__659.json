The `eachmatch` function is used to find all the matches, and the `map` function is used to extract the code block from each match. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,218],"elapsed":2.264015709,"cost":0.0002925,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28319,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
