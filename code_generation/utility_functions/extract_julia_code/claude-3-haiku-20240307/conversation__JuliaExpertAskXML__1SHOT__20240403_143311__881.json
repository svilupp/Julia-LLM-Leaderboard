It then iterates through the lines, tracking whether it's currently inside a Julia code block or not. If it encounters the start of a Julia code block, it sets the `in_julia_block` flag to `true`. If it encounters the end of a code block, it appends the current block to the `julia_blocks` array and resets the `current_block` variable. If it's inside a Julia code block, it appends the current line to the `current_block` variable.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the collected Julia code blocks into a single string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[122,322],"elapsed":3.140739041,"cost":0.000433,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23707,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
