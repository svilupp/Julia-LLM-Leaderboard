[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty array to store the Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate through the lines\n    i = 1\n    while i <= length(lines)\n        # Check if the current line starts a Julia code block\n        if startswith(lines[i], \"```julia\")\n            # Extract the code block\n            code_block = []\n            i += 1\n            while i <= length(lines) && !startswith(lines[i], \"```\")\n                push!(code_block, lines[i])\n                i += 1\n            end\n            \n            # Add the code block to the array\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, join(code_block, '\\n'))\n        else\n            # Move to the next line\n            i += 1\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks into a single string\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. It splits the input Markdown document into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n2. It iterates through the lines, checking if the current line starts a Julia code block (i.e., starts with \"```julia\").\n3. If a code block is found, it extracts the lines of the code block and stores them in the `code_block` array.\n4. The extracted code block is then added to the `julia_code_blocks` array.\n5. Finally, the function joins the code blocks in the `julia_code_blocks` array into a single string and returns it.\n\nNote that the function does not provide any examples, as per the Special Instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[368,446],"elapsed":4.454022042,"cost":0.0006495,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25111,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
