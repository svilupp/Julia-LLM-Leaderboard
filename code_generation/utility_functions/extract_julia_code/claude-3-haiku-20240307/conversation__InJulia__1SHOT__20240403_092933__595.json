Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nThis function assumes that the Markdown document contains valid Julia code blocks with the \"```julia\" fences. It will return a single string containing all the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[80,218],"elapsed":2.566303583,"cost":0.0002925,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25084,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
