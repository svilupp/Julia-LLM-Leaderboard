[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a given markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    current_block = \"\"\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif line == \"```\"\n            in_code_block = false\n            if !isempty(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n                current_block = \"\"\n            end\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, and an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being built.\n2. We use a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we're currently inside a code block.\n3. We iterate through each line of the input markdown document (`md`):\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", we set `in_code_block` to `true` to indicate the start of a code block.\n   - If the line is \"```\" (the end of a code block), we set `in_code_block` to `false` and add the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array, then reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n   - If we're inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the current line to `current_block` along with a newline.\n4. Finally, we return the joined `code_blocks` with newlines in between.\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code blocks from the input markdown document and return them as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,463],"elapsed":4.444204958,"cost":0.0006705000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14445,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
