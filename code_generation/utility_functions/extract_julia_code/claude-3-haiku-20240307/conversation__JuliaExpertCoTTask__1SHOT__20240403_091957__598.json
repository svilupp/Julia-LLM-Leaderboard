Once a code block is found, the function extracts the code lines and appends them to the `julia_code` string. Finally, the function returns the `julia_code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[198,397],"elapsed":3.9311805,"cost":0.00054575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28869,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
