It then iterates over the content, checks if each block is a Markdown code block with the \"julia\" language, and if so, adds the code to the `julia_code` array. Finally, it joins the code blocks with a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,216],"elapsed":2.497546583,"cost":0.00029,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25464,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
