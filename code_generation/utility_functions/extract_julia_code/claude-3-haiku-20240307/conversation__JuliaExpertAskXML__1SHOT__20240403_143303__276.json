It collects the code lines in the `current_block` variable and adds them to the `julia_blocks` array whenever a closing code fence is encountered. Finally, it joins all the code blocks into a single string and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[122,264],"elapsed":2.890455875,"cost":0.00036050000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12278,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
