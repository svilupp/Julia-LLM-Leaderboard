Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a given Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")[2:end-1]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `split` function to split the input Markdown document by the code fence ````julia`, and then it removes the first and last elements of the resulting array (which will be the text before and after the code blocks). Finally, it joins the remaining elements (the code blocks) with a newline character to return a single string containing all the Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[117,151],"elapsed":1.928407708,"cost":0.000218,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20424,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
