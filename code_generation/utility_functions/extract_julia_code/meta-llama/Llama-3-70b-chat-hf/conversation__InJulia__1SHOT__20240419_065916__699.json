When it encounters a code block starting with ````julia`, it sets a flag `in_code_block` to `true` and starts accumulating the code block lines in `current_block`. When it encounters a line with only `````, it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, adds the current block to the `code_blocks` array, and resets `current_block`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[85,284],"elapsed":3.761946583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1436726798,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
