The regular expression ````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```` matches code blocks with the `julia` language, and captures the code inside the block. The `join` function is then used to join the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[85,202],"elapsed":1.706776708,"cost":4.486e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1025362165,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
