The regular expression ````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```` matches code blocks with the `julia` language, and the `.*?` part matches any characters (including newlines) in a non-greedy way. The `match[1]` part extracts the code block without the code fences.\n\nThe `join` function is then used to join the code blocks together with a newline. The resulting string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[85,243],"elapsed":2.001619875,"cost":5.224e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1358526786,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
