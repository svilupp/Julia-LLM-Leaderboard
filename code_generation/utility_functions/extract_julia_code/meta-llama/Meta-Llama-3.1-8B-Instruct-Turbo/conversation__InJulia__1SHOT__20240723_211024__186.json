The pattern matches code blocks with the `julia` language, and captures the code inside the block. The `join` function is then used to concatenate the code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[85,207],"elapsed":1.381083417,"cost":4.5759999999999996e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1768066865,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
