Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

The pattern matches code blocks with the `julia` language, and captures the code inside the block using a non-greedy match (`.*?`).\n\nThe function then removes the code fences by indexing into the `code_blocks` array to get the captured code, and joins the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown document is a string, and that the code blocks are in the format ````julia\\n...code...\\n````. If your markdown document has a different format, you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[85,289],"elapsed":1.878630125,"cost":6.0519999999999997e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1237419829,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
