[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    julia_code = join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `RE` module to find all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document. The regular expression ````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```` matches code blocks with the julia language. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters, which ensures that the code block is matched correctly even if it contains multiple lines.\n\nThe `join` function is then used to remove the code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline. The resulting string is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[343,216],"elapsed":1.83601475,"cost":7.318e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":2029047180,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
