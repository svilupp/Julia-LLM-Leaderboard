[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            code_blocks.push(line[7:end-3])  # remove code fences\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line in the markdown document. When it encounters a code block, it sets a flag to indicate that it's inside a code block. When it encounters the end of a code block, it sets the flag back to false. If it's inside a code block, it removes the code fences and adds the line to the list of code blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[194,206],"elapsed":1.522330334,"cost":5.648e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-878215854,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
