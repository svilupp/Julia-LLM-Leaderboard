[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\nTo solve this task, we will need to use Julia's string manipulation functions, specifically for splitting the markdown document into parts, identifying code blocks, and then joining them together. We'll also use regular expressions to identify Julia code blocks, which are typically fenced with triple backticks followed by the language name \"julia\".\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nWe'll define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document as a string, splits it into parts based on the code fences, filters out the parts that are not Julia code, removes the code fences, and finally joins the code blocks together with newline characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into parts based on the code fences\n    parts = split(md, r\"^```julia\\n\"m)\n    \n    # Filter out the parts that are not Julia code and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    julia_code_parts = [strip(part, ['\\n', '`']) for part in parts[2:end]]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with newline characters\n    joined_code = join(julia_code_parts, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nThe function `extract_julia_code` correctly identifies Julia code blocks in a markdown document by splitting the document at the code fences, filtering out non-code parts, cleaning the code parts, and joining them together. This approach ensures that the extracted code is clean and ready for further processing or execution.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    parts = split(md, r\"^```julia\\n\"m)\n    julia_code_parts = [strip(part, ['\\n', '`']) for part in parts[2:end]]\n    joined_code = join(julia_code_parts, \"\\n\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[343,421],"elapsed":7.777126375,"cost":0.00803,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1075501600,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
