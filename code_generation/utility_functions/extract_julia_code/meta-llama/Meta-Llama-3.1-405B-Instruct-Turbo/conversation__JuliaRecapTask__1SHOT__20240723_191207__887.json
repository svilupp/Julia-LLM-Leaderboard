[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Specifically, we'll use the `matchall` function from the `Base` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nWe'll define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all occurrences of Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks with newlines\n    code = join(map(block -> block[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nWe've defined a function that uses regular expressions to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks together with newlines. This solution should correctly extract the Julia code from the markdown document.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n    code = join(map(block -> block[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[342,341],"elapsed":5.846381083,"cost":0.0068249999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1029850475,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
