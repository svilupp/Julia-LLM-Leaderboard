When it encounters a Julia code fence, it sets a flag to true, and when it encounters a closing code fence, it sets the flag to false. When the flag is true, it appends each line to an array of code blocks. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with newlines and returns the result as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[85,422],"elapsed":7.19787675,"cost":0.006755000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":434811250,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
