[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We'll also use string manipulation functions like `replace` and `join`.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nWe'll define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as input and returns a string containing the extracted and joined Julia code.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks from the matches\n    code_blocks = [replace(match, pattern => s\"\\1\") for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nWe've used a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` matches the code fences ```julia and ``` , and captures the code block in between using a lazy match `(.*?)`. We've also used the `s` flag to make the dot `.` match newlines.\n\nWe've then used the `findall` function to find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document, and extracted the code blocks from the matches using a list comprehension.\n\nFinally, we've joined the code blocks with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    matches = findall(pattern, md)\n    code_blocks = [replace(match, pattern => s\"\\1\") for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[343,457],"elapsed":8.201749542,"cost":0.00857,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-553023840,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
