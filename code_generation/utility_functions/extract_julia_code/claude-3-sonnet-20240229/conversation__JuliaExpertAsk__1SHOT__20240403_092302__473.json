It iterates over each line of the document and extracts the code blocks enclosed between triple backticks (```). If the code block is preceded by `julia`, it is considered a Julia code block. The code blocks are collected in a tuple of (code_block, language), where `language` is \"julia\" for Julia code blocks and an empty string for others. Finally, all the Julia code blocks are joined with a newline separator and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[117,387],"elapsed":9.770119875,"cost":0.006156,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11486,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
