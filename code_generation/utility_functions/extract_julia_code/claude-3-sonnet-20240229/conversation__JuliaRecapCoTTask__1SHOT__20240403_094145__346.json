[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input and returns a string containing all Julia code blocks joined by newlines. It works by iterating through each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with \"```julia\", it marks the beginning of a code block. If a line starts with just \"```\", it marks the end of a code block. Any lines between these markers are considered code and are added to the `code_blocks` array. Finally, the function joins all code lines in `code_blocks` with newlines and returns the resulting string.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `extract_julia_code(md)` where `md` is the markdown string containing the code blocks you want to extract.","status":200,"tokens":[368,306],"elapsed":6.590478292,"cost":0.005694,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
