If not, you can install it using `] add Markdown` in the Julia REPL.\n\nHere's how the `extract_julia_code` function works:\n\n1. `Markdown.filter(md.content, Markdown.Code)` filters the markdown document `md` and returns a vector of all code blocks.\n2. `filter(cb -> cb.language == \"julia\", code_blocks)` filters the code blocks further and keeps only those with the language \"julia\".\n3. `map(cb -> join(cb.code, '\\n'), julia_code_blocks)` converts each Julia code block to a string by joining its lines with a newline character.\n4. `join(code_strings, '\\n')` joins all the code block strings with a newline character, effectively concatenating all the Julia code blocks into a single string separated by newlines.\n\nThe function returns this concatenated string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[80,375],"elapsed":7.240456333,"cost":0.0058649999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4591,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
