[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It iterates over the `codeblocks` iterator, filtering for blocks that are either explicitly marked as `julia` or `jl`, or have no language specified (assumed to be Julia).\n\nThe code within each block is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace and appended to the `code_blocks` vector. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks into a single string, separated by two newlines.\n\nThe function returns the resulting string `code_str` containing all the Julia code extracted from the markdown document.\n\nNote that this solution assumes the input `md` is a valid markdown string. Error handling for invalid input or edge cases is not included for brevity.","status":200,"tokens":[367,360],"elapsed":8.803957792,"cost":0.006501,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22470,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
