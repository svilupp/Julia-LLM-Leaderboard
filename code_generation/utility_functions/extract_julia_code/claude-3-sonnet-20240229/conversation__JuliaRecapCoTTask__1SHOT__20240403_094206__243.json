[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The `(.+?)` captures the code content in between.\n- `collect` is used to convert the regex iterator to a vector.\n- We extract the captured code from each match using `m.captures[1]`.\n- Finally, we join all the code snippets with newlines using `join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")`.\n\nThe function takes an `AbstractString` input `md` representing the markdown document, and returns a `String` containing the extracted Julia code blocks joined with newlines.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[368,279],"elapsed":6.309566,"cost":0.005289,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13431,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
