[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regex pattern to match code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join with newline\n    code = join(strip(match.captures[1]) for match in code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We define a regex pattern `pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` to match code blocks. The `ms` flags enable multi-line mode and dot-all mode, respectively.\n2. The `eachmatch` function is used to find all occurrences of the regex pattern in the input markdown string `md`.\n3. We collect all the matches into a vector `code_blocks`.\n4. For each match, we extract the captured group (the code block content) using `match.captures[1]` and remove any leading/trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n5. We join all the code block contents with a newline using `join(...)`.\n6. The final joined code is returned as a string.\n\nThis function assumes that the code blocks are fenced with triple backticks (```````) and have the language specified as `julia`. If the code block format is different, the regex pattern needs to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[367,379],"elapsed":8.924223958,"cost":0.006786,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31966,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
