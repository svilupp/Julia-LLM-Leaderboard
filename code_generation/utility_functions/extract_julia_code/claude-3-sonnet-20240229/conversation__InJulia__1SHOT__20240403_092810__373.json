It initializes an empty vector `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks and a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track whether the current line is part of a code block or not. It also initializes an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being processed.\n\nThe function then iterates over each line of the Markdown document using `eachline`. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it marks the beginning of a Julia code block, and the `in_code_block` flag is set to `true`. If the line starts with \"```\" (triple backticks), it checks if the current line is part of a code block or not using the `in_code_block` flag. If it is part of a code block, the `current_block` is appended to the `code_blocks` vector, and `current_block` is reset to an empty string. The `in_code_block` flag is also set to `false`.\n\nIf the current line is part of a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), the line is appended to the `current_block` string with a newline character.\n\nAfter iterating through all lines, the function returns a single string by joining all the extracted code blocks in the `code_blocks` vector with a double newline (`\"\\n\\n\"`).\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document follows the standard code block syntax with triple backticks (```), and it specifically looks for code blocks marked with \"```julia\" for Julia code. If the code blocks are marked differently or use a different syntax, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[80,588],"elapsed":12.383567333,"cost":0.00906,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32716,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
