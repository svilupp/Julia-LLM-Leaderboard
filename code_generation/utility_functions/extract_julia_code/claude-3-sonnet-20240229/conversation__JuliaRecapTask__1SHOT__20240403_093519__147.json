[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md))\n\n    # Extract code from blocks, removing code fences\n    code_parts = map(blocks) do block\n        match = match(r\"\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, block.match)\n        code = match === nothing ? \"\" : match.captures[1]\n        return code\n    end\n\n    # Join code parts with newline\n    return join(code_parts, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks of type `julia` in the given markdown string `md`. It collects these matches using `eachmatch` and the regex pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm`. The `s` flag allows `.` to match newlines and `m` allows `^` and `$` to match at newlines.\n\nFor each code block match, it extracts the code content by removing the code fences using another regex `r\"\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm`, matching the code content between the opening `\\n```julia` and closing `\\n````.\n\nFinally, it joins all the extracted code parts with a newline `\\n` and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this assumes the code blocks are correctly formatted with opening and closing code fences. It also assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other complexities in the markdown structure.","status":200,"tokens":[367,350],"elapsed":8.880495416,"cost":0.006351000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10374,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
