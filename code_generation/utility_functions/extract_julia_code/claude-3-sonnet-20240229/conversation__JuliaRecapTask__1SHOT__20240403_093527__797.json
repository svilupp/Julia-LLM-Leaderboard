[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_lines = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a string `md` as input, which represents the Markdown document.\n2. It splits the string into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes an empty vector `code_lines` to store the code lines.\n4. It initializes a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we're currently inside a code block or not.\n5. It loops over each line in the Markdown document.\n6. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true` and moves to the next line.\n7. If the line starts with \"```\" (signifying the end of a code block), it sets `in_code_block` to `false` and moves to the next line.\n8. If `in_code_block` is `true`, it appends the line to the `code_lines` vector.\n9. After the loop finishes, it joins all the code lines in `code_lines` with a newline character using `join(code_lines, \"\\n\")`.\n10. It returns the resulting string containing all the Julia code from the Markdown document.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document follows the standard convention of using triple backticks (```````) to delimit code blocks, and that the code blocks are explicitly labeled with \"julia\" after the opening triple backticks.","status":200,"tokens":[367,485],"elapsed":8.398977333,"cost":0.008376,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22803,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
