It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n2. It uses a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track whether it is currently inside a code block or not.\n3. It iterates over each line of the markdown document using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n4. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true` and skips to the next line.\n5. If the line starts with \"```\" (code fence without language specification), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`. If there is a non-empty `current_block`, it appends it to `code_blocks` and resets `current_block`.\n6. If `in_code_block` is `true`, it appends the current line to `current_block`, followed by a newline character.\n7. After iterating through all lines, it joins the code blocks in `code_blocks` with a double newline `\"\\n\\n\"` and returns the resulting string.\n\nThis function assumes that code blocks are properly fenced with \"```julia\" and \"```\" markers. It ignores any code blocks that are not specifically marked as Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[80,507],"elapsed":9.984997833,"cost":0.007845,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21368,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
