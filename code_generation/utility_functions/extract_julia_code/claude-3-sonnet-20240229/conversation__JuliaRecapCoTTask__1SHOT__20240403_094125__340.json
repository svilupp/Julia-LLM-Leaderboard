[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks between ``` and ```\n    code_blocks = match.(r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each block, removing code fences\n    codes = map(m -> strip(m.captures[1], '\\n'), code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Use a regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\"sm` to find all code blocks starting with ````julia` and ending with `````. The `(.+?)` captures the code content. `s` and `m` modifiers allow matching across multiple lines and treat newlines appropriately.\n\n2. `match` is used to find all matches, and we extract the captured code from each match using `m.captures[1]` and strip leading/trailing newlines.\n\n3. `map` is used to extract the code from each matched block.\n\n4. Finally, we `join` all the code blocks with `\"\\n\\n\"` to separate them with blank lines.\n\nThe function takes an `AbstractString` argument to allow strings or other string-like types. It uses standard functions from Base Julia and doesn't require any external packages.\n\nThe approach is efficient as it avoids unnecessary loops or string operations, making it suitable for large markdown documents with many code blocks. The regex pattern ensures we only extract Julia code blocks, ignoring other code fences or content.","status":200,"tokens":[368,367],"elapsed":10.249002541,"cost":0.006609,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28444,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
