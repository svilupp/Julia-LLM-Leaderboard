It uses a loop to iterate over each line of the document.\n\nFor each line, it checks if the line starts with \"```julia\". If so, it sets the `in_code_block` flag to `true` and initializes an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block.\n\nIf the line starts with \"```\", it means the end of the current code block. In this case, it appends the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array and sets the `in_code_block` flag to `false`.\n\nIf the line is part of a code block, it concatenates the line with a newline character to the `current_block` string.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with two newline characters (`\"\\n\\n\"`) and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[80,379],"elapsed":6.154393333,"cost":0.005925,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24477,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
