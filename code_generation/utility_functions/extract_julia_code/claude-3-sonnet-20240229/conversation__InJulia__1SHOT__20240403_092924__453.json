Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks, a boolean `in_code_block` to track whether we're currently inside a code block, and an empty string `current_block` to store the current code block being processed.\n2. The function iterates over each line of the markdown document using `eachline(md)`.\n3. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it means we're entering a Julia code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `true` and skip to the next line.\n4. If the line starts with \"```\" (and doesn't contain \"julia\"), it means we're exiting a code block, so we set `in_code_block` to `false`. If there's any code in `current_block`, we push it to the `code_blocks` array and reset `current_block` to an empty string.\n5. If `in_code_block` is `true`, it means we're inside a code block, so we append the current line to `current_block` with a newline character `\"\\n\"`.\n6. After iterating over all lines, the function joins all the code blocks in `code_blocks` with a double newline `\"\\n\\n\"` and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown document is well-formed and that code blocks are properly delimited with code fences (````julia` and ````).","status":200,"tokens":[80,551],"elapsed":9.628000333,"cost":0.008505,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5129,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
