[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    julia_code = String[]\n    block_started = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"```julia\")\n            block_started = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"```\")\n            block_started = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if block_started\n            push!(julia_code, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input and returns a `String` containing all the Julia code blocks, with code fences removed and the blocks joined with a newline.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. `julia_code` is an empty `String` array to store the lines of Julia code.\n2. `block_started` is a boolean flag to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not.\n3. We iterate over each line of the markdown string using `eachline`.\n4. If the line starts with `\"```julia\"`, we set `block_started` to `true` and skip to the next line.\n5. If the line starts with `\"```\"` (indicating the end of a code block), we set `block_started` to `false` and skip to the next line.\n6. If `block_started` is `true`, we `strip` the line and add it to the `julia_code` array.\n7. After iterating over all lines, we `join` the lines in the `julia_code` array with a newline `\\n` and return the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the `julia` language specifier. It also assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other Markdown syntax within the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[367,453],"elapsed":9.539417875,"cost":0.007896,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29205,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
