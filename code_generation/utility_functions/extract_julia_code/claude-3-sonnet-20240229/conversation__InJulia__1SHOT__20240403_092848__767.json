Define a regular expression pattern `pattern` to match code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"m` matches code blocks that start with ````julia`, followed by any characters (including newlines) until the closing code fence `````.\n\n2. Use the `eachmatch` function from the `Base.Regex` module to find all occurrences of the code block pattern in the markdown document `md`.\n\n3. Collect the matches into an iterator `code_blocks`.\n\n4. For each match, extract the captured code block (i.e., `match.captures[1]`) and remove any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip`.\n\n5. Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline character `\"\\n\"` using the `join` function.\n\n6. Return the joined code as a string.\n\nThis function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are fenced with ````julia` and `````. If the code blocks use a different fencing syntax, you'll need to modify the regular expression pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[80,415],"elapsed":7.657872041,"cost":0.006465,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9507,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
