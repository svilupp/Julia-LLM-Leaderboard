[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks from a markdown document `md`, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks with a newline, returning a `String`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_code_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_code_block)\n            current_code_block = \"\"\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n2. It initializes a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not.\n3. It initializes an empty string `current_code_block` to store the lines of the current code block being processed.\n4. It loops through each line of the input markdown document `md`.\n5. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true` and skips to the next line.\n6. If the line starts with \"```\" (indicating the end of a code block), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, appends the `current_code_block` to the `code_blocks` array, and resets `current_code_block` to an empty string.\n7. If `in_code_block` is `true`, it appends the current line to `current_code_block` followed by a newline character.\n8. After processing all lines, it joins the `code_blocks` array with a double newline separator and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are delimited by \"```julia\" and \"```\" markers. It also assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[80,528],"elapsed":9.284940125,"cost":0.00816,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24278,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
