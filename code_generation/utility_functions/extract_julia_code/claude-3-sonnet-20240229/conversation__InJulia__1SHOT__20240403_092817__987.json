It then filters out all the `Markdown.Code` objects that have the language set to \"julia\". The `code` field of these objects is converted to a `String` and joined together with newline separators (`\"\\n\\n\"`). Finally, the joined code string is returned.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted with proper code fences (triple backticks) and the language identifier \"julia\". It does not handle any other types of code blocks or inline code snippets.","status":200,"tokens":[80,280],"elapsed":6.22375425,"cost":0.0044399999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4228,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
