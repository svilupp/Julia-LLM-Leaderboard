[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = Pair{String,String}[]\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_code = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            current_code = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, current_code => \"julia\")\n        elseif in_code_block\n            current_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return join(getindex.(code_blocks, 1), \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string `md` as input and returns a string containing all Julia code blocks joined together with newlines.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. It initializes an empty vector `code_blocks` to store code blocks as pairs of (code, language).\n2. It splits the markdown string `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It uses a flag `in_code_block` to track whether it's currently inside a code block or not.\n4. It iterates over each line in the markdown:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to true and resets `current_code` to an empty string.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" (signaling the end of a code block), it sets `in_code_block` to false and appends the `current_code` to the `code_blocks` vector as a pair (code, \"julia\").\n   - If it's inside a code block (`in_code_block` is true), it appends the line to `current_code` with a newline character.\n5. After iterating through all lines, it extracts the first element (the code) from each pair in `code_blocks` using `getindex.(code_blocks, 1)`.\n6. Finally, it joins all the extracted codes with a double newline `\"\\n\\n\"` and returns the resulting string.\n\nThis implementation handles multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown document and returns a single string containing all the code, with each code block separated by a double newline.","status":200,"tokens":[368,553],"elapsed":10.731281833,"cost":0.009399000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27301,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
