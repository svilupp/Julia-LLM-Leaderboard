[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function to extract Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        startswith(line, \"```julia\") && continue\n        endswith(line, \"```\") && continue\n        startswith(line, \"```\") && continue\n        push!(code_blocks, line)\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the code lines.\n2. Iterate over each line in the markdown document.\n3. If the line starts with \"```julia\" or ends with \"```\", skip it (these are the code fences).\n4. If the line starts with \"```\", skip it (this could be a code fence for a different language).\n5. Otherwise, push the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n6. After iterating through all lines, join the `code_blocks` array with newline characters and return the result as a string.\n\nThe function uses string operations and the `split` and `join` functions to process the markdown document and extract the Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[198,279],"elapsed":6.348441334,"cost":0.004779,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23839,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
