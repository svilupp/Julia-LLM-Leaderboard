Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted Julia code lines. The `in_code_block` flag keeps track of whether the current line is inside a code block or not.\n\nThe function then iterates over each line of the markdown document using `eachline` and an `IOBuffer` to handle the string input. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to `true` and moves to the next line. If the line starts with \"```\" (indicating the end of a code block), it sets `in_code_block` to `false` and moves to the next line.\n\nIf `in_code_block` is `true`, it means the current line is part of a Julia code block, so the line is appended to the `code_blocks` array using `push!`.\n\nAfter iterating through all lines, the function joins the `code_blocks` array into a single string using `join` with a newline `\"\\n\"` as the separator, effectively concatenating all code blocks with newlines in between. The resulting string is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[80,408],"elapsed":7.156700708,"cost":0.00636,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
