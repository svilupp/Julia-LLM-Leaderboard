[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use a regular expression to find all code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n\n    # Extract the code inside each code block\n    extracted_code = map(code_blocks) do block\n        match = block.match\n        code = match.captures[1]\n        strip(code, '\\n')\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    join(extracted_code, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Use a regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` to find all code blocks starting with ````julia` and ending with `````. The `(.*?)` captures the code inside the fences.\n2. Use `eachmatch` to find all matches and `collect` to convert it to a vector of `RegexMatch` objects.\n3. Map over the vector of `RegexMatch` objects, extracting the captured code with `match.captures[1]` and stripping any leading/trailing newlines with `strip(code, '\\n')`.\n4. Join the vector of extracted code with `join(extracted_code, \"\\n\\n\")` to add a newline between code blocks.\n\nThis function takes an `AbstractString` input `md` representing the markdown document and returns a `String` containing the extracted and joined Julia code blocks.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the code fences are exactly ````julia` and does not handle other types of code blocks. It also assumes that there are no nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[368,388],"elapsed":8.552543875,"cost":0.0069240000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21358,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
