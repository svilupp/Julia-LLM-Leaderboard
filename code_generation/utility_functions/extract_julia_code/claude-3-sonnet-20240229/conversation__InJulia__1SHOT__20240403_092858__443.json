It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks and a boolean flag `in_code_block` to track if the current line is inside a code block or not.\n\nThe function then iterates through each line of the Markdown document using the `eachline` function. If the line starts with \"```julia\", it marks the beginning of a Julia code block, and the `in_code_block` flag is set to `true`. If the line starts with \"```\" (without \"julia\"), it marks the end of a code block, and the current code block is added to the `code_blocks` array if it's not empty. The `in_code_block` flag is then set to `false`.\n\nIf the `in_code_block` flag is `true`, the current line is appended to the `current_block` string, separated by a newline character.\n\nAfter iterating through all lines, if the `current_block` is not empty, it is added to the `code_blocks` array.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array with a newline character and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the Markdown document follows the correct syntax for code blocks, with triple backticks (```) used to delimit the code blocks and \"julia\" specified after the opening triple backticks to indicate a Julia code block.","status":200,"tokens":[80,560],"elapsed":9.809992,"cost":0.00864,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29505,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
