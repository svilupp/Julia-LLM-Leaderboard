[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use a regex to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]+?)\\n```\"m\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n\n    # Remove code fences and join blocks with newline\n    code = join(map(m -> m.captures[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n1. The `extract_julia_code` function takes a markdown document `md` as an `AbstractString`.\n2. It uses a regular expression (`r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]+?)\\n```\"m`) to match Julia code blocks delimited by ````julia` code fences. The `m` flag enables multiline mode.\n3. `eachmatch` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in `md`, and `collect` converts the iterator to a collection.\n4. `map` is used to extract the captured code (group 1) from each match.\n5. The extracted code blocks are joined with `\"\\n\\n\"` to separate them with blank lines.\n6. The joined code string is returned.\n\nThis approach uses Julia's built-in regex and string manipulation capabilities to extract and process the code blocks efficiently. The function is generic and should work with any valid markdown document containing Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[368,335],"elapsed":7.614991875,"cost":0.006129,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24996,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
