[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function to extract Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = Tuple{String, String}[]  # (language, code) pairs\n    current_block = Tuple{String, String}(\"\", \"\")\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            current_block = (\"julia\", \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            current_block = (\"\", \"\")\n        elseif !isempty(current_block[1])\n            current_block = (current_block[1], current_block[2] * \"\\n\" * line)\n            if !isempty(current_block[2])\n                push!(code_blocks, current_block)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(map(x -> x[2], filter(x -> x[1] == \"julia\", code_blocks)), \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It iterates through each line of the markdown document.\n2. If the line starts with `\"```julia\"`, it marks the start of a new code block for Julia.\n3. If the line starts with `\"```\"` alone, it marks the end of any current code block.\n4. For all other lines, if the current code block language is \"julia\", it appends the line to the current code block string.\n5. After each code block is complete, it adds the `(language, code)` pair to the `code_blocks` tuple.\n6. Finally, it filters out all non-Julia code blocks, joins the remaining Julia code blocks with double newlines, and returns the result as a string.\n\nThe function uses tuple unpacking to access the language and code strings, and handles edge cases like empty or malformed code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[367,437],"elapsed":9.356201833,"cost":0.007656,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
