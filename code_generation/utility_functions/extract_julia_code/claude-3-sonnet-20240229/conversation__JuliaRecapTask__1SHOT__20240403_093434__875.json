[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function to extract code blocks from a Markdown document:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the Markdown content\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = Markdown.filter(parsed) do block\n        Markdown.iscode(block) && Markdown.code(block).language == \"julia\"\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks with newline\n    code = join(map(Markdown.code, code_blocks) do code\n        strip(string(code), head=3, tail=3)\n    end, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `Markdown` module from the Julia standard library is imported.\n2. The `extract_julia_code` function takes a string `md` containing the Markdown content.\n3. The `Markdown.parse` function is used to parse the Markdown content into a data structure.\n4. The `Markdown.filter` function is used to extract all code blocks from the parsed data structure. The filter condition checks if the block is a code block (`Markdown.iscode(block)`) and if the language is \"julia\" (`Markdown.code(block).language == \"julia\"`).\n5. The `map` function is used to remove the code fences (three backticks at the beginning and end) from each code block using `strip(string(code), head=3, tail=3)`.\n6. The `join` function is used to concatenate all the code blocks with a newline character `\"\\n\"` in between.\n7. The final string containing the concatenated Julia code is returned.\n\nThis function assumes that the code blocks in the Markdown document are correctly formatted with triple backticks (```) and the language specified as \"julia\". It will extract all such code blocks, remove the code fences, and join them together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[367,454],"elapsed":9.128273166,"cost":0.007911,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3915,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
