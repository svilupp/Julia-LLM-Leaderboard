[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    julia_code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")\n    julia_code = join(julia_code_blocks[2:end], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(julia_code, \"\\n```\" => \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a string `md` representing the markdown document as input. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. `split(md, \"```julia\")` splits the input string `md` around the code fence ````julia`, creating an array of substrings. The first element of this array is the text before the first code block, and the remaining elements are the code blocks themselves, with the code fences included.\n\n2. `julia_code_blocks[2:end]` creates a new array containing only the substrings that correspond to the code blocks, excluding the first element (which is the text before the first code block).\n\n3. `join(julia_code_blocks[2:end], \"\\n\")` joins all the code block substrings back together, separating them with a newline character `\\n`.\n\n4. `replace(julia_code, \"\\n```\" => \"\")` removes the remaining code fences (`\\n````) from the joined code string.\n\n5. Finally, the cleaned-up Julia code string is returned.\n\nThe key steps are:\n- Split the input string on the code fence marker ````julia`\n- Extract the substrings that represent code blocks\n- Join those substrings with newlines\n- Remove any remaining code fences\n\nThis approach assumes that the code blocks are correctly fenced with ````julia` and that there are no nested code blocks. It also assumes that the input `md` is an `AbstractString`.","status":200,"tokens":[367,406],"elapsed":8.4100795,"cost":0.0071909999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24206,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
