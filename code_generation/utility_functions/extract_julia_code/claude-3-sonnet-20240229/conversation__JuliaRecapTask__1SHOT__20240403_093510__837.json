[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks with newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n\n    # Extract the code blocks from the matches\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n\n    # Join the code blocks with newlines\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the `extract_julia_code` function works:\n\n1. The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` is used to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern matches the code fence ````julia`, followed by newline `\\n`, then captures all characters `(.*?)` until the next code fence `\\n````, and the `s` modifier enables the `.` to match newlines.\n\n2. The `eachmatch` function is used to find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document, and the matches are collected into a vector using `collect`.\n\n3. The code blocks are extracted from the matches using a list comprehension `[m.captures[1] for m in matches]`. The `captures` array of each match contains the captured groups, and we take the first capture group (`captures[1]`), which corresponds to the code block content.\n\n4. The code blocks are joined together with newlines using the `join` function: `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")`.\n\n5. The joined code is returned as a string.\n\nThis function assumes that the input `md` is a string containing the markdown document with Julia code blocks. It will extract all the code blocks, remove the code fences, and join them together with newlines, returning a single string containing the combined Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[367,480],"elapsed":10.368139166,"cost":0.008301,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15427,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
