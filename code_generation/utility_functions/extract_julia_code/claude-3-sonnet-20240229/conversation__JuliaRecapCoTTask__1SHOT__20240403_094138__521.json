[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We initialize an empty string `code` to store the extracted code.\n2. We split the input string into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. We define a flag `in_code_block` to track whether we are currently inside a code block or not.\n4. We iterate over each line in the input string.\n5. If the line starts with a code fence for Julia (`\"```julia\"`), we toggle the `in_code_block` flag to `true` and continue to the next line.\n6. If the line starts with a code fence for any other language (`\"```\"`), we toggle the `in_code_block` flag to `false` and continue to the next line.\n7. If we are inside a code block (`in_code_block` is `true`), we append the line to the `code` string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace and adding a newline character.\n8. After iterating over all lines, we remove the trailing newline from the `code` string using `strip(code)`.\n9. Finally, we return the `code` string containing all the extracted Julia code.\n\nThis function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are properly formatted with code fences and that there are no nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[368,604],"elapsed":12.585478625,"cost":0.010164,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20555,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
