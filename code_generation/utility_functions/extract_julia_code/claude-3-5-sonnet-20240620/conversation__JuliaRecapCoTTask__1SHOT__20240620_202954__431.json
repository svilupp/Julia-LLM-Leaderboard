[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that processes a markdown document and extracts Julia code blocks. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace\n    return strip(extracted_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We define a regular expression `pattern` that matches Julia code blocks. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s` looks for:\n   - The opening fence ```julia followed by a newline\n   - Any characters (non-greedy) captured in a group\n   - The closing fence ```\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. We extract the captured code from each match using a list comprehension `[m.captures[1] for m in matches]`. This gives us an array of code blocks.\n\n4. We join these code blocks with newlines using the `join` function.\n\n5. Finally, we use `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting string.\n\nThis function will return a single string containing all the Julia code extracted from the markdown document, with code blocks separated by newlines and code fences removed.","status":200,"tokens":[368,378],"elapsed":5.358613625,"cost":0.0067740000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12017,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
