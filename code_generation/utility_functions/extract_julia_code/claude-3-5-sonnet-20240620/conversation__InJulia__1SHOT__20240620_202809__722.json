It defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in markdown. The pattern looks for \"```julia\" at the start, captures all content until the closing \"```\", and excludes the closing fence from the capture.\n\n2. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. It extracts the captured code from each match, effectively removing the code fences.\n\n4. Finally, it joins all extracted code blocks with newlines and returns the result as a single string.\n\nThis function will return a string containing all Julia code from the markdown document, with code fences removed and multiple blocks joined by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,325],"elapsed":4.745114125,"cost":0.005115,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6358,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
