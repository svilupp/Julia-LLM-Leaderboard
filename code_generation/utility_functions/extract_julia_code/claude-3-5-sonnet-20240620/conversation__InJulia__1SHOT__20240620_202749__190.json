It defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in the markdown.\n2. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string.\n3. It extracts the code from each match, excluding the code fences.\n4. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks with newlines and returns the result as a single string.\n\nThis function will work with markdown documents containing single or multiple Julia code blocks, and it will remove the code fences (``` julia) while preserving the actual code content.","status":200,"tokens":[80,280],"elapsed":4.214186458,"cost":0.0044399999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22561,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
