[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes code fences, and joins multiple code blocks together. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match, removing the code fences\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newlines\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We define a regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` to match Julia code blocks. The `s` flag allows the dot (`.`) to match newlines.\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. We extract the code from each match using list comprehension, accessing the captured group (the code inside the fences) with `match.captures[1]`.\n\n4. Finally, we join all the extracted code blocks with newlines using the `join` function.\n\nThe function takes an `AbstractString` as input, which allows for various string types, and returns a `String` containing the extracted and joined Julia code.\n\nThis implementation efficiently extracts all Julia code blocks from the markdown document, removes the code fences, and combines multiple blocks if present, satisfying all the requirements of the task.","status":200,"tokens":[368,389],"elapsed":6.498897625,"cost":0.006939,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18141,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
