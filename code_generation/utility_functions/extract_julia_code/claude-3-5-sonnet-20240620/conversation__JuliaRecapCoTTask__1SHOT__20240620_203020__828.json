[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that processes a markdown document and extracts Julia code blocks. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove any trailing newlines\n    return rstrip(extracted_code)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`, which allows for various string types.\n\n2. We create a regular expression `code_block_pattern` to match Julia code blocks. The pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s` does the following:\n   - Matches the opening fence ```julia followed by a newline\n   - Captures everything (.*?) non-greedily until the closing fence ```\n   - The `s` flag allows the dot to match newlines\n\n3. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document.\n\n4. We extract the code from each match using list comprehension: `[m.captures[1] for m in matches]`. This gives us an array of code blocks.\n\n5. We join the extracted code blocks with newlines using `join(..., \"\\n\")`.\n\n6. Finally, we use `rstrip` to remove any trailing newlines from the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently extracts all Julia code blocks from the markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins multiple code blocks (if present) with newlines. The function returns a single string containing all the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[368,454],"elapsed":6.845841916,"cost":0.007914000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16986,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
