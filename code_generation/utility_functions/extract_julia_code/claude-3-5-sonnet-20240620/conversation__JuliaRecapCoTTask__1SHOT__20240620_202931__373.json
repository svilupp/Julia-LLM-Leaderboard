[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes code fences, and joins multiple code blocks together. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:(?!```)[\\s\\S])*)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code content from each match\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with newlines\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We define a regular expression `code_block_regex` that matches Julia code blocks in markdown. It looks for the pattern ```julia followed by any content until the closing ```.\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. We extract the code content from each match using list comprehension. The actual code is in the first capture group of each match.\n\n4. We join all the extracted code blocks with newlines using the `join` function.\n\n5. Finally, we return the joined code as a single string.\n\nThis function will work for markdown documents containing one or multiple Julia code blocks, and it will ignore any other content outside of these blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[368,368],"elapsed":5.721448625,"cost":0.006624,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26137,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
