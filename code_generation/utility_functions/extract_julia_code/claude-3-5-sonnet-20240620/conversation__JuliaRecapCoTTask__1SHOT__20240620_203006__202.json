[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description and without any special instructions provided, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code lines.\n2. Use a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we're currently inside a Julia code block.\n3. Iterate through each line of the input markdown string:\n   - If a line starts with \"```julia\", set `in_code_block` to true.\n   - If a line starts with \"```\" and we're in a code block, set `in_code_block` to false.\n   - If we're in a code block, add the line to `code_blocks`.\n4. Join all the extracted code lines with newline characters and return the result as a string.\n\nThis implementation handles multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks together with newlines as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[368,375],"elapsed":5.796344167,"cost":0.006729,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
