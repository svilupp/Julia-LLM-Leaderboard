[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description and without any specific special instructions provided, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join((m.captures[1] for m in matches), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a markdown document as an input string (`md::AbstractString`).\n2. It defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks. The pattern looks for:\n   - \"```julia\" at the start of a code block\n   - Any content (including newlines) inside the block (non-greedy match)\n   - \"```\" at the end of the code block\n3. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the markdown document.\n4. It extracts the code content from each match (excluding the code fences) using captures.\n5. It joins all extracted code blocks with newlines.\n6. Finally, it returns the resulting string containing all the extracted Julia code.\n\nThis implementation satisfies the requirements:\n- It extracts all Julia code blocks from the markdown.\n- It removes the code fences (```julia and ```) from the extracted code.\n- It joins multiple code blocks (if present) with newlines.\n- It returns a String containing the extracted code.\n\nThe function is designed to be efficient and clear, using Julia's string processing capabilities and regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[368,425],"elapsed":6.30994075,"cost":0.007479,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2756,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
