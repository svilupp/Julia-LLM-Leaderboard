[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that processes a markdown document and extracts Julia code blocks. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:(?!```)[\\s\\S])*)\\n```\"\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join((m.captures[1] for m in matches), \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We define a regular expression `code_block_regex` that matches Julia code blocks. It looks for:\n   - The opening fence ```julia\n   - Followed by a newline\n   - Any content that's not a closing fence (```), captured in a group\n   - A newline and the closing fence ```\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. We extract the captured code (without the fences) from each match using a generator expression `(m.captures[1] for m in matches)`.\n\n4. We join these extracted code blocks with newlines using the `join` function.\n\n5. Finally, we return the resulting string containing all the extracted and joined Julia code.\n\nThis implementation handles multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown, removes the code fences, and joins the blocks with newlines as required. The function takes an `AbstractString` as input to be more flexible with different string types and returns a `String`.","status":200,"tokens":[367,397],"elapsed":6.033377167,"cost":0.007056,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":355,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
