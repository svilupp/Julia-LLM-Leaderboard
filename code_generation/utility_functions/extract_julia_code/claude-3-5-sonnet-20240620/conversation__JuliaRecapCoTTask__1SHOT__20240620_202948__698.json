[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown string as input and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks concatenated together. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:(?!```)[\\s\\S])*)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown string\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline character\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We define a regular expression `code_block_regex` that matches Julia code blocks. It looks for \"```julia\" at the start, captures all content until the closing \"```\", and excludes the opening and closing fence lines.\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the regex pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. We extract the captured code (without the fences) from each match using a list comprehension.\n\n4. Finally, we join all the extracted code blocks with a newline character and return the result as a single string.\n\nThis implementation handles multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown, removes the code fences, and concatenates the blocks with newlines between them. The function returns a String as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[368,368],"elapsed":5.696264333,"cost":0.006624,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27893,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
