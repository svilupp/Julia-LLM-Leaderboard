[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document as per your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It defines a regular expression `code_block_regex` that matches Julia code blocks in markdown. The pattern looks for \"```julia\" followed by any content (including newlines) until it finds the closing \"```\".\n\n2. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. It extracts the code content from each match using list comprehension. The `captures[1]` gets the content inside the code block (excluding the code fences).\n\n4. It joins all extracted code blocks with a newline character.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the resulting string containing all the extracted and joined Julia code.\n\nThis function will work with markdown documents containing single or multiple Julia code blocks, and it will remove the code fences as required. The returned string will be the concatenation of all Julia code blocks, separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[367,351],"elapsed":5.531026708,"cost":0.006366,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1295,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
