[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the lines of Julia code.\n2. It uses a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we're currently inside a Julia code block.\n3. It iterates through each line of the input markdown string using `eachline` and an `IOBuffer`.\n4. For each line, it checks:\n   - If the line starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to true.\n   - If the line starts with \"```\" and we're currently in a code block, it sets `in_code_block` to false.\n   - If we're inside a code block, it adds the line to `code_blocks`.\n5. Finally, it joins all the collected code lines with newline characters and returns the result as a string.\n\nThis function will extract all Julia code blocks from the markdown, remove the code fences, and join multiple code blocks (if present) with newlines. The result is returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[367,390],"elapsed":5.337033292,"cost":0.006951000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23917,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
