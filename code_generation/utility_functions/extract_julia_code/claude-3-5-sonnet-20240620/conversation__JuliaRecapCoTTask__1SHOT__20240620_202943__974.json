[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Thank you for providing the task. I'll create the `extract_julia_code` function as requested, following the given instructions. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    in_code_block = false\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a markdown string `md` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code lines.\n3. It uses a boolean flag `in_code_block` to keep track of whether we're currently inside a Julia code block.\n4. It iterates through each line of the input markdown string.\n5. When it encounters a line starting with \"```julia\", it sets `in_code_block` to true.\n6. When it encounters a line starting with \"```\" while `in_code_block` is true, it sets `in_code_block` to false.\n7. If `in_code_block` is true and the line doesn't start with \"```\", it adds the line to `code_blocks`.\n8. Finally, it joins all the extracted code lines with newline characters and returns the result as a string.\n\nThis implementation meets the requirements of extracting Julia code blocks from the markdown, removing code fences, and joining multiple code blocks with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[368,412],"elapsed":5.504590333,"cost":0.007284,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
