It defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern looks for \"```julia\" at the start of a code block and \"```\" at the end.\n\n2. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. It extracts the code from each match using list comprehension, accessing the captured group (the code inside the fences) and removing any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n\n4. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks with newlines and returns the result as a single string.\n\nThis function will return a string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document, with code fences removed and multiple blocks joined by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,340],"elapsed":4.767230459,"cost":0.00534,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27386,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
