[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Extract all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract code content from each match and join with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove any trailing newlines\n    return rstrip(joined_code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1.
