It defines a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The pattern looks for \"````julia`\" at the start of a block, captures all content until it finds the closing \"```\", and uses non-greedy matching to handle multiple code blocks.\n\n2. It uses `eachmatch` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input markdown string.\n\n3. It extracts the captured code from each match using a list comprehension, removing any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip()`.\n\n4. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks with newlines and returns the result as a single string.\n\nThis function will return a string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document, with code fences removed and multiple blocks joined by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[80,346],"elapsed":5.025919125,"cost":0.00543,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9228,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
