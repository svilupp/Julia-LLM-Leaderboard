[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**:\n   - String manipulation functions: `split`, `join`, `startswith`, `endswith`.\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching.\n   - Looping constructs: `for`, `while`.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - We need to identify code blocks that start with ```julia` and end with ```.\n   - Extract the content between these fences.\n   - Join the extracted content with newlines if there are multiple code blocks.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**:\n   - Ensure that all code blocks are correctly identified and extracted.\n   - Verify that the output is a single string with code blocks joined by newlines.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    current_block = []\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            current_block = []\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the Document**:\n   - The document is split into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. **Identifying Code Blocks**:\n   - We iterate through each line and check if it starts with ```julia` to identify the start of a Julia code block.\n   - If it starts with ```julia`, we set `in_code_block` to `true`.\n   - If it starts with ``` and `in_code_block` is `true`, we set `in_code_block` to `false` and add the collected lines to `code_blocks`.\n\n3. **Collecting Code Lines**:\n   - While `in_code_block` is `true`, we collect lines into `current_block`.\n\n4. **Joining Code Blocks**:\n   - After collecting all code blocks, we join them with double newlines using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")`.\n\nThis function should correctly extract and join all Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[393,643],"elapsed":14.660092125,"cost":0.006966,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1207100861,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
