X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here are the steps we'll take:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task.\n2. Solve the task by writing the `extract_julia_code` function.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\n- **String manipulation**: `split`, `join`, `replace`\n- **Regular expressions**: `r\"pattern\"`, `match`, `eachmatch`\n- **Control structures**: `for`, `if`\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to:\n1. Identify the Julia code blocks in the markdown document.\n2. Extract the content of these code blocks.\n3. Remove the code fences.\n4. Join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the content of each code block and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\n- **Pattern Matching**: Ensure the regular expression correctly matches Julia code blocks.\n- **Content Extraction**: Verify that the content of each code block is correctly extracted.\n- **Joining**: Confirm that the code blocks are joined with a newline.\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` should now correctly extract and join all Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[393,483],"elapsed":9.974914667,"cost":0.005526,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2088997140,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
