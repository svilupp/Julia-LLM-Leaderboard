Uses `Markdown.codeblocks` to extract all code blocks from the markdown document.\n2. Filters the code blocks to keep only those that are in the Julia language.\n3. Maps each Julia code block to its content, joined by a newline.\n4. Joins all the Julia code blocks together, separated by newlines.\n5. Returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[81,193],"elapsed":1.996418334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":686866145,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
