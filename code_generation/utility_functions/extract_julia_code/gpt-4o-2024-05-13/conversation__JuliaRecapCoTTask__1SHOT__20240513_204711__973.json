[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, let's break it down into systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify and Extract Code Blocks**: We need to find all the code blocks in the provided markdown document. Code blocks are enclosed within triple backticks ``` (```) and specifically marked with `julia` right after the initial set of backticks.\n2. **Remove Code Fences**: Once identified, the code blocks need to have their fences (```) removed.\n3. **Concatenate Code Blocks**: Join all extracted code blocks into a single string separated by newlines.\n4. **Return the Result**: Provide the final concatenated string as the output.\n\nWe can utilize regular expressions for identifying code blocks and string manipulations to handle the extraction and formatting.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to capture julia code blocks\n    r = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s  # (?s) flag enables dot to match newlines\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    # Collect all matches\n    for match in eachmatch(r, md)\n        push!(code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    # Join all collected code blocks with newlines\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Breakdown:\n1. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` captures any content between triple backticks, with `julia` specified right after the opening backticks. The `(?s)` flag (or `s` at the end of the regex in Julia) ensures that the dot `.` matches newline characters as well.\n2. The `eachmatch` function generates all matches in the markdown string.\n3. Each captured code block is added to the `code_blocks` array.\n4. Finally, `join` concatenates the extracted code blocks with a newline separator.\n\nThis approach ensures that all Julia code blocks are extracted, concatenated, and returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[338,429],"elapsed":3.958732833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-625669514,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
