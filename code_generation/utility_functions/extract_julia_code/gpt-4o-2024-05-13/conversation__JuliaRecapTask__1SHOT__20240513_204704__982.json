[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task of extracting and joining Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Read through the Markdown Content:**\n    - Utilize regular expressions to detect Julia code blocks.\n2. **Extract Code Blocks:**\n    - Remove code fences (those triple backticks or any language-specific tags like ```julia).\n3. **Join the Code Blocks:**\n    - Concatenate the code blocks with a newline separating them.\n\nHere is a Julia function to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to capture Julia code blocks.\n    julia_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\s(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match, placing them in an array\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `julia_block_pattern` defines a regular expression to find Julia code blocks. The `s` flag allows the `.` to match newlines as well so that we can encapsulate multi-line code blocks.\n- `eachmatch` with the regular expression returns all the matches in the input markdown string `md`.\n- A comprehension extracts the captured groups (the actual Julia code sans the fences) from each match.\n- `join` combines these code blocks into one string, separated by newlines.\n\nThe resulting string contains all the concatenated Julia code blocks from the input markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[337,358],"elapsed":3.361004625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":257363225,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
