[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to systematically extract Julia code blocks from a provided markdown string. Here are the steps to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Julia code blocks in markdown are enclosed by triple backticks ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ````. We need to find segments of text that start with ```` ```julia ```` and end with ```` ``` ````.\n\n2. **Remove Code Fences**: Extract the content between these markers and strip away the ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ````.\n\n3. **Join Multiple Blocks**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we need to concatenate them, separated by newlines.\n\n4. **Return the Result as a Single String**.\n\nHere is the Julia function to accomplish this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regex to match all julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Capture the code block and strip any leading/trailing whitespace\n        push!(code_blocks, strip(match.captures[1]))\n    end\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Additional Details:\n- **Regex Explanation**:\n  - ```` ```julia ```` marks the start of a Julia code block.\n  - ```` ``` ```` marks the end of the code block.\n  - `s` flag in the regex allows the dot `.` to match newline characters, ensuring multiline code blocks can be captured.\n  - The capture group `(.*?)` is used to capture everything between the code block markers lazily.\n\nLet's assure that the function is correctly defined and briefly outline how it works:\n- **eachmatch** is used to find all regex matches in the string.\n- The matches are processed to extract and strip the actual code content.\n- Finally, all code blocks are joined with a newline separating them.\n\nThis method ensures accurate extraction and formatting of Julia code blocks from a markdown string.","status":200,"tokens":[337,443],"elapsed":5.169505333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1330298462,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
