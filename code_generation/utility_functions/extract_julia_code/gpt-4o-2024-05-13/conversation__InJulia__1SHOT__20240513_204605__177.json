Hereâ€™s a function that extracts Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Collect all matches of Julia code blocks\n    matches = match.(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks and concatenate them with newlines\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches if m !== nothing]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to capture the content of Julia code blocks delimited by triple backticks (```julia ... ```). The `join` function is then used to concatenate the code blocks with newlines. The `s` modifier in the regular expression ensures that the dot (`.`) matches newline characters as well.","status":200,"tokens":[81,223],"elapsed":2.199475959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1991807360,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
