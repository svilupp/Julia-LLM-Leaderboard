[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, let's break down the required steps:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Markdown uses triple backticks (\\`\\`\\`) to denote code blocks, which might also include a language identifier like \\`\\`\\`julia.\n2. **Extract the Code**: Once we identify the code blocks, we'll extract the content within these blocks.\n3. **Concatenate the Code**: Join the contents of all the detected code blocks with a newline.\n4. **Return the Result**: Output the concatenated string of Julia code.\n\nHere's how we can implement the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n1. **Processing Markdown Content**: Use regular expressions to identify and extract code blocks. We'll need to handle multiline strings properly.\n2. **Concatenate and Format**: Make sure the concatenated code is returned as a single string with proper newlines between the code blocks.\n\nLet's implement `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\s+([^`]*)```\"\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    # Extract code content and join them with newline\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Regular Expression**: The pattern `r\"```julia\\s+([^`]*)```\"` is constructed to:\n   - ` ```julia` to match the starting of a Julia code block.\n   - `\\s+` to match any whitespace characters that might appear after the language identifier.\n   - `([^`]*)` to capture the actual code content which does not contain backticks.\n   - ` ``` ` to match the ending of a code block.\n   \n2. **Capturing the Code Blocks**: Using `matchall`, we extract all matches of the pattern from the `md` string. Each match will contain the code block content as its first capture group.\n\n3. **Processing the Matches**: We extract the captures and join them using newline characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle multiple Julia code blocks correctly and concatenately, maintaining clarity and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[338,466],"elapsed":4.283978833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":737934477,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
