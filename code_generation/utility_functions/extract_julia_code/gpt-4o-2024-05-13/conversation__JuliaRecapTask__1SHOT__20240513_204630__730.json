[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: Markdown code blocks start with triple backticks (``````) followed by a language identifier (e.g., `julia`).\n2. **Extract and Clean Code Blocks**: Remove the code fences (i.e., `````` followed by `julia` and the closing ```).\n3. **Concatenate Code Blocks**: Concatenate all the extracted Julia code blocks using newline characters.\n\nHere's a systematic approach to the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match code blocks\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n    matches = match(code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Variable to hold all the extracted code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n\n    while matches !== nothing\n        # Extract the code block by capturing group 1\n        push!(julia_code_blocks, matches.captures[1])\n        # Find the next match\n        matches = match(code_block_pattern, md, occursinpos(code_block_pattern, md, matches.offset + 1))\n    end\n\n    # Join all extracted code blocks with a newline\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regex Pattern `code_block_pattern`**: This pattern captures Julia code blocks. It starts with `'''julia` and ends with `'''`, capturing everything in between (using the non-greedy `.*?`).\n2. **Extract Matches**: The `match` function is used to find code blocks in the markdown string `md`.\n3. **Iterate Over Matches**: Loop through all matches, extracting the captured Julia code and appending it to `julia_code_blocks`.\n4. **Join Code Blocks**: Finally, all the elements in `julia_code_blocks` are joined using newline characters to form the resulting string.\n\nThis solution ensures that all Julia code snippets embedded in the markdown document are correctly extracted and concatenated into a single string without the markdown fencing.","status":200,"tokens":[337,446],"elapsed":4.163809917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2006522112,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
