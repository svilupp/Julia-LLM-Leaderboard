[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task:\n\n1. Parse the markdown document to identify the Julia code blocks.\n2. Extract these code blocks without the code fences.\n3. Join all the extracted code blocks with a newline.\n4. Return the resulting single string.\n\nHere is how we can approach this in Julia:\n\n1. Use regular expressions to find the code blocks.\n2. Remove the triple backticks and the language specification.\n3. Concatenate the extracted code blocks together with newline characters.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\s+(.*?)\\s+```\"\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_code_pattern, md, dotall=true)\n    \n    julia_code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    \n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `julia_code_pattern`: This regex finds blocks that start with ```julia, contain some code, and end with ```. The `dotall=true` option allows the dot `.` to match newlines.\n- `eachmatch`: This function returns an iterator of match objects for all occurrences.\n- `m.captures[1]`: Extracts the first capture group, which is the actual content inside the code fences.\n- `join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")`: Joins all extracted code blocks with newline characters.\n\nThis function effectively parses the markdown and extracts, concatenates, and returns all the Julia code blocks as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[337,324],"elapsed":3.107113375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-279589358,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
