[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract Julia language code blocks from a given markdown document and join them together, you need to follow these steps:\n1. Create a regular expression that identifies Julia code blocks defined by triple backticks (```) with the language specifier `julia`.\n2. Extract all such Julia code blocks.\n3. Remove the code fences (```) surrounding the extracted code blocks.\n4. Join the extracted code content together with a newline character.\n\nHere's how you can do it systematically:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to identify julia code blocks\n    julia_block_pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match, removing leading/trailing whitespaces\n    julia_codes = strip(match.captures[1] for match in matches)\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(julia_codes, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct:\n1. The regular expression `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s` should correctly match Julia code blocks including potential multiline content by using the `s` flag.\n2. `eachmatch` function finds all code blocks.\n3. Using `strip` on each extracted code block captures ensures that any leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines) is removed.\n4. `join` with `\"\\n\"` properly concatenates all code blocks with newlines in between.\n\nThis approach should work efficiently and correctly for the given task.","status":200,"tokens":[337,350],"elapsed":4.0421005,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":667872554,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
