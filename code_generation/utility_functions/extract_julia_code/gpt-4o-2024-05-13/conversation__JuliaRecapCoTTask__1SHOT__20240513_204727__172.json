[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task of extracting and joining Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify and extract all Julia code blocks.\n2. Remove the code fences (````` ```julia`````) from each identified block.\n3. Combine the contents of the extracted code blocks into a single string, separated by newlines.\n\nWe will use regular expressions to identify the Julia code blocks in the markdown text and perform the required operations.\n\nHere's the implementation of `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each matched block\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    combined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return combined_code\nend\n```\n\n- The **regular expression** `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` is designed to:\n  - Match triple backticks followed by \"julia\" and a newline (start of a Julia code block).\n  - Capture non-greedy any characters `.*?` until it encounters the next newline followed by triple backticks (end of the Julia code block).\n  - The `s` flag lets the dot `.` match newline characters too, ensuring blocks spanning multiple lines are correctly captured.\n  \n- We use the `eachmatch` function to iterate over all matches in the input document.\n\n- Extract the captured Julia code from each match and join them together, adding newlines between consecutive code blocks.\n\nLet's double-check this solution to ensure it meets the requirements:\n- It captures and extracts all Julia code blocks, removing the code fences.\n- Joins the extracted code blocks with a newline.\n\nThis implementation should correctly process a markdown document containing Julia code blocks per the specified task.","status":200,"tokens":[338,432],"elapsed":4.010665958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-214757370,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
