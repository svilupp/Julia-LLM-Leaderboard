[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document and joining them with newlines, we'll need to:\n\n1. Identify Julia code blocks in the markdown document.\n2. Remove the code fences.\n3. Join the extracted code blocks with a newline.\n\nWe can achieve this by:\n- Using regular expressions to identify the start and end of Julia code blocks.\n- Using string operations to extract and clean these blocks.\n\nHere's a systematic approach to solve the task:\n\n1. Use a regular expression to match triple backticks followed by `julia` and then capture everything in between until the closing triple backticks.\n2. Replace code fences with empty strings and concatenate all extracted code blocks.\n3. Return the resulting string.\n\nHere's the full implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(PackageSpec(name=\"HTTP\", version=\"1.0\"))\n```\n\n```julia\nusing HTTP\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression matching Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the string\n    matches = match(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Collect all code blocks and clean them\n    code_blocks = []\n    while matches !== nothing\n        # Extract the code block without the fences\n        code_block = matches.captures[1]\n        push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n        # Find the next match\n        matches = match(pattern, md, after(matches.offset + length(matched(matches))))\n    end\n    \n    # Join code blocks with newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n- The `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s` regular expression will ensure that we're capturing everything between `'''julia` and `'''`, including newlines (`s` flag).\n- The `join` function will concatenate the extracted code blocks.\n\nAfter implementing this function, it should be able to process any markdown string and return the extracted Julia code blocks joined with newlines. \n\nMake sure to test the function thoroughly to handle edge cases like no Julia blocks, nested code blocks (which is usually not valid in markdown), and varying amounts of whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[338,452],"elapsed":4.316854083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":53676744,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
