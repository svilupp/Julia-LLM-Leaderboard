[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we'll follow these steps:\n1. Use a regular expression to identify code blocks in the markdown document.\n2. Extract the contents of these code blocks.\n3. Concatenate the extracted code blocks with a newline separator.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nKey Julia functions and concepts that will be relevant:\n- `match` from the `Regex` module to find code blocks.\n- `join` to concatenate strings with a specified separator.\n\nHere's the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expression to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Collect all matches of the code blocks\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the matched code blocks, each group is captured in the first capture group\n    code_blocks = [m.match[1] for m in matches]\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down this implementation:\n1. **Regular Expression Pattern**:\n    - `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s`: This pattern matches code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ``` while capturing the code inside.\n    - The `s` flag allows the `.` in the regular expression to match newlines.\n2. **matchall**:\n    - Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown string.\n3. **Extraction and Concatenation**:\n    - Extracts the first capture group from each match (i.e., the content inside the code block).\n    - Joins all code blocks together with a newline separator.\n\nEnsure that `matchall` and `join` are used correctly in this context.\n\nThis function should handle markdown documents with multiple Julia code blocks and return the correctly concatenated Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[337,392],"elapsed":3.683370875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-913293874,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
