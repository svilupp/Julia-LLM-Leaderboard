[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's go ahead and solve the task step-by-step.\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Recall useful Julia snippets**:\n    - We will use regular expressions to detect and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n    - For string manipulation, basic functions like `matchall`, `replace` and concatenation functions will be useful.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n    - Extract all code blocks denoted by the code fences ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ````.\n    - Remove the code fences from these blocks.\n    - Join all extracted code blocks into a single string with a newline separating them.\n\n## Function Implementation\n\nBelow is the Julia code to accomplish the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md, flags=\"s\")\n    cleaned_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks]\n    joined_code = join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- `matchall` with the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"` and the `flags=\"s\"` retrieves all Julia code blocks. The `flags=\"s\"` enables the dot `.` to match newline characters as well.\n- We extract the captured groups (actual code without code fences) with `[match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks]`.\n- We then join these cleaned code blocks using `join(cleaned_blocks, \"\\n\")`.\n- Finally, we return the result.\n\n## Double-check\n\nLet's go through the function to ensure everything is correct:\n1. **Capturing Code Blocks**: The regex correctly identifies Julia code blocks by looking for the ` ```julia ` opening and ` ``` ` closing.\n2. **Removing Code Fences**: The captured group ensures the code fences are removed.\n3. **Joining Code Blocks**: Using `join` with \"\\n\" ensures all blocks are concatenated with a newline separator.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure our solution is both efficient and correct.","status":200,"tokens":[338,439],"elapsed":4.041282959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-559958203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
