[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the task, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the Julia code blocks within the provided Markdown document.\n2. Extract these blocks, removing the code fences (```julia and ```).\n3. Join the extracted code blocks into a single string, separated by a newline if there are multiple blocks.\n\nHere is the Julia function `extract_julia_code` that will achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Use regular expressions to locate julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = Base.findall(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, s=1)\n\n    # Extracting the text between the code fences\n    extracted_blocks = [match[1] for match in julia_code_blocks]\n\n    # Joining the extracted code blocks with newline separator\n    joined_code_blocks = join(extracted_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to identify the Julia code blocks in the Markdown string. It then extracts and concatenates the code blocks into a single string. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Regular Expressions**: We use a regex pattern `r\"```julia(.*?)```\"` to match any Julia code blocks in the Markdown. The `*?` ensures non-greedy matching, grabbing the smallest possible block for each match.\n2. **Extraction and Cleanup**: The text between code fences is extracted from each match, and then all the pieces are joined together with a newline.\n3. **Efficiency**: The function is designed to handle large Markdown documents efficiently and return the desired concatenated code string.\n\nThis approach ensures we accurately extract and combine all the Julia code blocks from the Markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[337,353],"elapsed":3.29792425,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-157697674,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
