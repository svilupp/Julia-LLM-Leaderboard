[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we will break down the task into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the code blocks in the markdown document using the code fences ```` ```julia ``` ````.\n2. Extract the content of each Julia code block.\n3. Concatenate the extracted contents, ensuring that each code block is separated by a newline.\n\nWe'll use regular expressions to identify the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. Here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Define a regular expression to capture code blocks marked with `julia`\n    julia_code_regex = r\"```julia\\s*(.*?)\\s*```\"s\n\n    # Initialize a Vector to collect all code snippets\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Use the regex to find all Julia code blocks\n    for match in eachmatch(julia_code_regex, md)\n        push!(code_blocks, match.captures[1])\n    end\n\n    # Join all collected code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Function\n\n1. **Regular Expression Definition**:\n   - The regular expression `r\"```julia\\s*(.*?)\\s*```\"s` is defined to match code blocks that start with ```` ```julia ```` and end with ```` ``` ````.\n   - Here `s` is the string option to allow `.` to match newline characters as well.\n   - The `\\s*` matches any whitespace characters (including newlines) ensuring that we capture the content inside the code block correctly.\n   - `(.*?)` is a non-greedy match to capture all content between the code fences.\n\n2. **Finding and Collecting Matches**:\n   - The `eachmatch` function is used to find all the matches of the defined regex in the document.\n   - For each match, the contents of the code block are extracted using `match.captures[1]` and stored in the `code_blocks` array.\n\n3. **Concatenating Code Blocks**:\n   - Finally, the collected code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nMake sure to use this function with the appropriate markdown input to verify its correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[337,485],"elapsed":5.738865459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-205022594,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
