[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we need to:\n\n1. **Extract Julia code blocks**: Identify and isolate all Julia code blocks within the markdown.\n2. **Remove code fences**: Strip away the code fences (```julia and ```) from the identified blocks.\n3. **Join the code blocks**: Merge all the extracted code snippets into a single string separated by newlines.\n\nHere is the Julia function to perform the required task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    in_julia_block = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_julia_block = false\n        elseif in_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n    - Create an empty array `julia_code_blocks` to store the lines of Julia code.\n    - Use a boolean variable `in_julia_block` to track if we are inside a Julia code block.\n\n2. **Iteration through Each Line**:\n    - Use a loop to iterate through each line of the markdown content.\n    - Check for the start of a Julia code block with `startswith(line, \"```julia\")`.\n      - If found, set `in_julia_block` to `true`.\n    - Check for the end of a code block with `startswith(line, \"```\")`.\n      - If found outside of specifying a language, set `in_julia_block` to `false`.\n    - If we are currently inside a Julia code block (`in_julia_block` is `true`), add the line to the `julia_code_blocks` array.\n\n3. **Joining the Code Blocks**:\n    - Use the `join` function to concatenate all accumulated lines in `julia_code_blocks` with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`).\n\n### Final Output:\nThe function returns a single string containing all the Julia code extracted from the markdown, separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[338,454],"elapsed":4.196882334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":338355008,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
