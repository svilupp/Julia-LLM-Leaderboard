[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Recall Julia Snippets\n\nWe will need the following Julia snippets to complete this task:\n- String handling functions like `occursin`, `split`, and regular expressions.\n- Concatenation of strings.\n- Iterating through elements, perhaps a list of lines.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n1. **Extract Code Blocks:**\n   - Identify Julia code blocks which are typically denoted by triple backticks followed by `julia`.\n2. **Remove Code Fences:**\n   - We need to strip the triple backticks and language specifier.\n3. **Join Code Blocks:**\n   - Concatenate multiple code blocks with a newline.\n\nHere is the function `extract_julia_code` built systematically:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Match and find all julia code blocks\n    in_block = false\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    current_block = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_block = true\n            continue # Skip the fence itself\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            continue # Skip the fence itself\n        end\n        \n        if in_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check the Solution\n\n- **Input**: A markdown string containing multiple Julia code blocks.\n- **Output**: A single string comprising all the Julia code blocks concatenated together with newlines.\n\nThis solution handles various edge cases, such as nested code blocks (unsupported but worth noting for extension) and blocks not starting with `julia`.\n\n### Ensure Functionality\n\n- **Correct Identification**: The function identifies and strips only Julia code blocks correctly.\n- **Proper Concatenation**: The function joins these blocks with a newline.\n\nThis concise yet effective function should cover most markdown documents containing Julia code snippets without ambiguity.","status":200,"tokens":[338,438],"elapsed":4.851143209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1850485262,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
