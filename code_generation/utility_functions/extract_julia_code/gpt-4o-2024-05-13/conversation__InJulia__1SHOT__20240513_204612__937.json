Below is the implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = match.(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the captured groups, which contain the content inside the code fences\n    code_blocks = getfield.(matches, :captures)\n\n    # Remove any additional start line matched with captures\n    code_blocks = filter(â‰ (nothing), code_blocks)\n\n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function performs the following steps:\n\n1. Defines a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the Markdown document, including multiline blocks (using the `s` flag for dot-all mode to match newlines as well).\n2. Finds all matches of the pattern in the provided Markdown string.\n3. Extracts the captured groups, which contain only the contents inside the code fences.\n4. Filters out any `nothing` values that can occur if there are blocks without captures.\n5. Joins all the extracted code blocks into a single string with each block separated by a newline.\n\nYou can call this function with your Markdown string to get all the Julia code blocks extracted and combined.","status":200,"tokens":[81,334],"elapsed":3.755018083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1628306573,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
