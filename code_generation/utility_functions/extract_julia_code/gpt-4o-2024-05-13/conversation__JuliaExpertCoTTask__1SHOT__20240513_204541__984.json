Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will:\n\n1. Identify the Julia code blocks within the markdown document.\n2. Remove the code fences surrounding each code block.\n3. Join multiple code blocks together with a newline.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nLet's proceed to implement this step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Code Blocks**:\n    - Locate regions in the markdown that begin with ```julia and end with ```.\n\n2. **Remove Code Fences**:\n    - Extract the lines in between the fences.\n\n3. **Join Code Blocks**:\n    - Concatenate the extracted code blocks with a newline in between.\n\n### Implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Regular expressions to match julia code blocks\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = match.(code_block_pattern, [md])\n    \n    # Extract and clean code blocks\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches if !ismissing(m)]\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with newline\n    result = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Regular Expression**: We use a regular expression `r\"```julia\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```\"` to:\n    - Match the start of a Julia code block with ```julia,\n    - Capture everything inside the block non-greedily `([\\s\\S]*?)`,\n    - Match the end of the code block with ```.\n\n2. **Match Extraction**: We use `match.` to apply the regular expression to the input string.\n\n3. **Clean and Extract**: We filter out any missing matches and extract the captured content from each match.\n\n4. **Join and Return**: Finally, we join the extracted code blocks with newlines and return the resulting string.\n\nThis function should handle the provided task correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[190,423],"elapsed":4.232707208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":153614325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
