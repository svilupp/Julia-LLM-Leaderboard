[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document and joining them, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Scan the entire markdown document to identify and extract code blocks surrounded by triple backticks ``` (fences).\n2. Check if the code block is specifically marked as Julia.\n3. Remove the backticks from the identified code blocks.\n4. Join all the extracted and cleaned code blocks into a single string with newline separators.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation of the function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_code_blocks = String[]\n    code_block_open = false\n    is_julia_block = false\n    current_code_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        # Check for the opening of a code block\n        if occursin(\"```\", line)\n            if code_block_open\n                if is_julia_block\n                    # Finish current code block\n                    push!(julia_code_blocks, String(take!(current_code_block)))\n                end\n                code_block_open = false\n                is_julia_block = false\n            else\n                code_block_open = true\n                is_julia_block = occursin(\"julia\", line)\n            end\n        elseif code_block_open && is_julia_block\n            # Collect lines that belong to the Julia code block\n            println(current_code_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all Julia code blocks with a newline, if any\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- We iterate through each line of the markdown document using `eachline`.\n- We check for the opening and closing of code blocks using ``` and determine if the code block is marked with `julia`.\n- When a Julia code block is detected, lines are written to an `IOBuffer`, and upon closing the block, the content is stored in an array `julia_code_blocks`.\n- Finally, we join all collected Julia code blocks into a single string separated by newlines.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle multiple Julia code blocks efficiently. Don't forget to test edge cases within markdown documents to verify correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[338,448],"elapsed":5.045797334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1046184540,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
