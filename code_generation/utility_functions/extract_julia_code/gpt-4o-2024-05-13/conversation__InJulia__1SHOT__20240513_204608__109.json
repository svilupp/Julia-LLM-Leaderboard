Here's a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that will extract the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document, remove the code fences, and concatenate them with newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_block = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            code_block = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, code_block)\n            in_code_block = false\n        elseif in_code_block\n            code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Iterates over each line in the provided Markdown document.\n2. Detects the start and end of Julia code blocks using \"```julia\" and \"```\".\n3. Collects all lines within those code blocks.\n4. Joins the extracted code blocks with newlines.\n\nBy the end, it returns a single string containing all Julia code blocks concatenated together.","status":200,"tokens":[81,252],"elapsed":2.909758792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2119650624,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
