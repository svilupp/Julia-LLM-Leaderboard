X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Identify code blocks specifically tagged for Julia in the markdown document.\n2. Extract these code blocks without the fencing.\n3. If there are multiple blocks, concatenate them with newline characters.\n4. Return the resultant string.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation based on these steps.\n\n### Julia Code Implementation\n\nYou'll create the function `extract_julia_code` that takes a string `md` (the markdown document) and processes it to extract and concatenate the Julia code blocks.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    julia_code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md; dotall=true)\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in julia_code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Regex Matching**: Use `matchall` with a regular expression that identifies `julia` code blocks bounded by triple backticks and the keyword `julia` (e.g., `\\`\\`\\`julia`).\n   - `dotall=true` ensures that the regex matches across multiple lines.\n2. **Capturing Code**: The regex uses a capture group `(.*?)` to capture all text between the backticks.\n3. **Extracted Code**: Convert each match to extract only the captured code sections.\n4. **Joining**: Concatenate these code sections with newline characters.\n\nThis function should effectively meet the requirements and work for any given markdown document containing Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[338,326],"elapsed":3.077120917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":154649791,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
