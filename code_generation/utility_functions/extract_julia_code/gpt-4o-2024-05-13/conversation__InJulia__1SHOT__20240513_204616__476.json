Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task of extracting and concatenating the Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can implement `extract_julia_code` in Julia. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Identify the boundaries of each Julia code block by looking for the markdown code fences (```` ```julia ... ``` ````).\n2. Extract the contents between these code fences.\n3. Concatenate these extracted pieces with a newline separator.\n\nBelow is the function `extract_julia_code` implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_code_block = false\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_code_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- Split the input markdown document `md` into lines.\n- Initialize a flag `in_code_block` to track whether the current line is inside a Julia code block.\n- Initialize an array `code_blocks` to store lines of code.\n- Loop through each line:\n  - If the line starts with ```` ```julia ````, set the flag `in_code_block` to `true`.\n  - If the line starts with ```` ``` ```` and `in_code_block` is `true`, this indicates the end of a Julia code block, so set `in_code_block` to `false`.\n  - If `in_code_block` is `true`, this line is part of a Julia code block, so add it to `code_blocks`.\n- After the loop, join all collected lines in `code_blocks` with newline characters to form the final concatenated string.\n\nThis function will return a single string containing all Julia code blocks concatenated with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[81,423],"elapsed":3.880909708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-987863097,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
