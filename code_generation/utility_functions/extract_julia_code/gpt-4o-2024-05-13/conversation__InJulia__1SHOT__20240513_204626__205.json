[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, you can use regular expressions to identify the Julia code blocks in the Markdown document, strip the code fences around them, and then concatenate the code blocks into a single string with newline separation. Below is the Julia function `extract_julia_code` that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) :: String\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the markdown\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia(.*?)```\"s\n\n    # Use findall to capture all matches of the Julia code blocks\n    blocks = findall(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Extract the content of each code block, strip the fences, and join them with newline\n    code_blocks = [m.match[1] for m in eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `code_block_regex` is a regular expression pattern that matches Julia code blocks surrounded by triple backticks. The `s` at the end of the pattern allows the `.` to match newline characters.\n2. The `findall` function is used to find all matches for the defined regular expression in the Markdown document.\n3. The comprehension `[m.match[1] for m in eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)]` extracts the content from each code block (without the fences).\n4. Finally, the extracted code blocks are joined together with newline characters using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`.\n\nYou can use this function to process a Markdown string containing multiple Julia code blocks, and it will return a single string with all the Julia code concatenated together.","status":200,"tokens":[81,349],"elapsed":3.955731583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1690367663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
