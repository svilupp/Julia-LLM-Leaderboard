[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions with the `Regex` type for pattern matching.\n- String manipulation functions like `split`, `strip`, and `join`.\n- Iteration with `for` loops and comprehensions.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code fences\n    julia_code_fence = r\"```julia\\n((?:.|\\n)*?)```\"`s\n    \n    # Use a capturing group to extract the content inside the code fences\n    # The `s` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters\n    code_blocks = matchall(julia_code_fence, md)\n    \n    # Strip the leading and trailing fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(strip.(code_blocks, ['`', '\\n']), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The regular expression `julia_code_fence` is designed to match the Julia code blocks, including multi-line content.\n- `matchall` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document.\n- `strip` is used to remove the leading and trailing backticks and newlines from each code block.\n- The code blocks are then joined with two newlines to separate them, as per typical markdown code block usage.\n- The function returns a single string containing all the Julia code from the markdown document.\n\nThe provided function should work correctly for the given task, extracting and joining all Julia code blocks from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[398,410],"elapsed":84.308315666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-80653723,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
