It extracts the code without the fences, strips any leading or trailing newlines, and then joins all the code blocks with two newline characters (to separate the blocks). The function returns the joined code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[89,333],"elapsed":9.315453125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1845717999,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
