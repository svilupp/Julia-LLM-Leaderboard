[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions with the `Regex` type and functions like `match`, `eachmatch`, and `replace` to identify and manipulate strings.\n- String manipulation functions such as `strip`, `join`, and `split` to process the markdown content.\n- Iteration with `for` loops or comprehensions to iterate over matches and process them.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks, including fences.\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n((?:.|\\n)*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code.\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Use eachmatch to find all occurrences of the regex in the markdown string.\n    for match in eachmatch(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n        # Extract the code block without the fences and add a newline.\n        code_block = strip(match.captures[1], '\\n')\n        # Append the code block to the extracted code string, adding a newline after each block.\n        extracted_code *= code_block * \"\\n\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    # Return the joined code blocks, removing any trailing newlines.\n    return strip(extracted_code, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The regular expression `julia_code_block_regex` is designed to match the entire Julia code block, including the fences.\n- The `s` flag in the regex allows the dot `.` to match newline characters, which is necessary to capture multi-line code blocks.\n- `eachmatch` is used to iterate over all matches of the regex in the provided markdown string.\n- `strip` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, including newlines, from each code block.\n- The code blocks are concatenated with two newlines between them to maintain separation between distinct blocks.\n- `strip(extracted_code, '\\n')` at the end ensures that there are no trailing newlines in the final output.\n\nThis function should correctly extract and join all Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document, as per the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[396,548],"elapsed":55.407566291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":612794465,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
