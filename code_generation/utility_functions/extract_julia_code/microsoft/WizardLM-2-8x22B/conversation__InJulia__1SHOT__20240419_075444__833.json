It extracts the content between the code fences, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and joins the code blocks with two newlines. The function then returns the concatenated string of all Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[89,359],"elapsed":15.139641083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":671727729,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
