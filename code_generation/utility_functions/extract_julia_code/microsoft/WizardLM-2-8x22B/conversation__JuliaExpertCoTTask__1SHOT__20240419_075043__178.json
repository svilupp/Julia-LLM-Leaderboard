Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Identify the code fences that mark the beginning and end of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. These are typically three backticks followed by the language identifier `julia` for the opening fence, and three backticks for the closing fence.\n   - Use regular expressions to match the patterns of the opening and closing fences along with the content inside them.\n   - Extract the content inside the fences, ensuring that we only capture Julia code blocks.\n   - Remove the code fences from the extracted content.\n   - Concatenate the extracted code blocks with a newline character to separate them.\n   - Return the concatenated string as the final output.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Define a regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_pattern = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"ms\n    \n    # Use the pattern to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(julia_code_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the content inside the code fences and remove the fences\n    extracted_code = join(map(code_block -> replace(code_block, julia_code_pattern => s\"\\1\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    # Return the concatenated code blocks\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n```julia\n# The function `extract_julia_code` is already defined above\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with the provided data to ensure it extracts the Julia code correctly.\n   - Test the function with markdown containing multiple code blocks to ensure they are concatenated with newlines.\n   - Test the function with markdown containing code blocks of other languages to ensure they are not extracted.\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = extract_julia_code(\"```julia\\nprintln(\\\"hello world\\\")\\n```\")\n@assert result == \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\\n\"\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` should now be ready to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document, remove the fences, and return the concatenated code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[224,575],"elapsed":43.025045834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1085164097,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
