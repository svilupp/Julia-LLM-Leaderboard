[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions with the `Regex` type for pattern matching.\n- String manipulation functions like `split`, `strip`, and `join`.\n- Iteration with `for` loops and comprehensions.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Define a regular expression to match Julia code fences\n    julia_code_fence = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # Use the regular expression to find all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(julia_code_fence, md, dotall=true)\n    \n    # Extract the code inside the fences and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    extracted_code = [strip(code_block) for code_block in code_blocks]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline character\n    joined_code = join(extracted_code, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The function `extract_julia_code` uses a regular expression to find all instances of Julia code blocks within the provided markdown string `md`.\n- The `matchall` function is used with the `dotall` flag to ensure that the pattern matches across multiple lines.\n- The code inside the fences is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, including newlines, using `strip`.\n- The extracted code blocks are then joined together with two newline characters to separate the blocks, as per the task requirements.\n- The function returns the joined string of Julia code.\n\nThe solution should work correctly for the given task, extracting and joining all Julia code blocks from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[398,419],"elapsed":46.35503625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-916263518,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
