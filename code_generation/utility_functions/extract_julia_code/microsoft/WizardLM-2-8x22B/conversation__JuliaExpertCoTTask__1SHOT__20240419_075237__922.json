Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Identify the code fences that mark the beginning and end of Julia code blocks. These are typically three backticks followed by the language identifier `julia` on the first line, and three backticks on a line by themselves at the end.\n   - Extract the content between these fences, ensuring that we capture all occurrences in the document.\n   - Remove the code fences from the extracted content.\n   - Join multiple code blocks together with a newline character to separate them.\n   - Return the resulting string containing all the Julia code.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Remove the code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(map(code -> replace(code, r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\"), code_blocks), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - Apply the `extract_julia_code` function to the provided markdown string.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with the provided data to ensure it extracts the Julia code correctly.\n   - Test with edge cases, such as nested code blocks, code blocks without the `julia` language identifier, and markdown with no code blocks.\n\nNow, let's apply the function to the provided data:\n\n```julia\nmd_data = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_data)\n```\n\nThe `extracted_code` should contain the string `\"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[224,466],"elapsed":69.9270055,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":893082497,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
