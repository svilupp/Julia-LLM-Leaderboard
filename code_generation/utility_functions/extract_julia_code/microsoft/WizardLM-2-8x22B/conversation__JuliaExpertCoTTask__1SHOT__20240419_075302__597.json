[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Identify the code fences that mark the beginning and end of Julia code blocks. These are typically three backticks followed by the language identifier `julia` on the first line, and three backticks on a line by themselves at the end.\n   - Extract the content between these code fences, ensuring that the fences themselves are not included in the output.\n   - If there are multiple code blocks, concatenate them with a newline character to separate each block.\n   - Return the concatenated string of all Julia code blocks.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline character\n    extracted_code = join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n```julia\n# The function `extract_julia_code` is already defined above\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with the provided data to ensure it extracts the Julia code correctly.\n   - Test the function with edge cases, such as nested code blocks, code blocks with indentation, and markdown documents with no Julia code blocks.\n\nNow, applying the function to the provided data:\n```julia\nmd_data = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_data)\n```\n\nThe expected output for the provided data would be:\n```\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\n\nThis output is the content of the Julia code block without the fences and without any additional newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[224,461],"elapsed":24.505798458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1049745052,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
