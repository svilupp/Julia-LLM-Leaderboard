Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Identify the code fences that mark the beginning and end of Julia code blocks. These are typically three backticks followed by the language identifier `julia` on the first line, and three backticks on a line by themselves at the end.\n   - Extract the content between these code fences, ensuring that we do not include the fences themselves.\n   - If there are multiple code blocks, concatenate them with a newline character to separate each block.\n   - Return the concatenated string of all Julia code blocks.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline character\n    joined_code = join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace and return the result\n    return strip(joined_code)\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n```julia\n# The function `extract_julia_code` is already defined above\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with the provided data to ensure it extracts the Julia code correctly.\n   - Test the function with multiple code blocks to ensure they are concatenated with a newline.\n   - Test the function with non-Julia code blocks to ensure they are not extracted.\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided data\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")\n\n# The expected output should be the content inside the code fence without the fences\n@assert extracted_code == \"println(\\\"hello world\\\")\"\n```\n\nThe function `extract_julia_code` is now ready to be used to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[224,494],"elapsed":38.986517042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1423567650,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
