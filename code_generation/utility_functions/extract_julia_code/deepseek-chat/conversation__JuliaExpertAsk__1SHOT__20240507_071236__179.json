Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that should do what you're asking for. This function uses regular expressions to find and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the regex in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `Base.Iterators` module to find all occurrences of the regex in the markdown string. The `captures` field of each match object contains the captured groups, and we're interested in the first group, which is the code block itself. We then join all the extracted code blocks with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[120,273],"elapsed":17.355681625,"cost":9.324000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1121025788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
