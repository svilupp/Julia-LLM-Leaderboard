Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that should do what you're asking for. This function uses regular expressions to find and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the code fences and any leading/trailing whitespace\n        code = strip(match.captures[1], '\\n')\n        push!(code_blocks, code)\n    }\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will find all code blocks enclosed in ```` ```julia ```` and ```` ``` ```` in the markdown document, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks with a newline. The `matchall` function from the `Base.Iterators` module is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the string. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing newline characters from each code block.","status":200,"tokens":[120,328],"elapsed":21.038170041,"cost":0.00010864,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1396109963,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
