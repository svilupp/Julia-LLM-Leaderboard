Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that should do what you're asking for. This function uses regular expressions to find and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = match(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = matches.captures\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the Julia code blocks are fenced with triple backticks followed by `julia` to indicate the language. The regular expression `[\\s\\S]*?` is used to match any character (including newlines) but in a non-greedy manner to stop at the next occurrence of `````. The `matches.captures` will give us an array of all the captured code blocks, which we then join together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[120,282],"elapsed":22.267391333,"cost":9.576e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":507914729,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
