It then processes each match to remove the code fences and any leading or trailing newlines. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks with a newline and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[81,383],"elapsed":21.943029917,"cost":0.00011858,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2105956417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
