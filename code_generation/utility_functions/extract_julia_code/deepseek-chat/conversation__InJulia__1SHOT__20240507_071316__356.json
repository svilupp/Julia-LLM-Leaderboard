It then iterates over each match, strips the code fences (`'` characters) and newline characters from the beginning and end of the captured code, and joins the resulting code snippets with a newline character. The final joined string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[81,270],"elapsed":18.644082708,"cost":8.694e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1950531938,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
