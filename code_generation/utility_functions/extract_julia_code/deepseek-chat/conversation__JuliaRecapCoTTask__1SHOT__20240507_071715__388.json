[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize a flag to indicate if we are inside a code block\n    inside_code_block = false\n    \n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown document\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with a code fence (```)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # Toggle the inside_code_block flag\n            inside_code_block = !inside_code_block\n            # If we are inside a code block, add the line without the code fence\n            if inside_code_block\n                extracted_code *= replace(line, \"```julia\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        elseif inside_code_block\n            # If we are inside a code block, add the line without any changes\n            extracted_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the last newline character\n    extracted_code = chop(extracted_code)\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document and checking if the line starts with the code fence \"```julia\". If it does, it toggles the `inside_code_block` flag. If the flag is true, it adds the line to the `extracted_code` string, removing the code fence if necessary. After processing all lines, it removes the last newline character and returns the `extracted_code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[369,424],"elapsed":26.294474708,"cost":0.00017038,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":782940303,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
