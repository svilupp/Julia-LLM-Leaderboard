Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that can extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document. This function uses regular expressions to find the code blocks and then processes them as described:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the regex in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with newlines\n    extracted_code = join(map(m -> m.captures[1], matches), \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `matchall` function from the `Markdown` package to find all occurrences of the code block pattern. It then extracts the code from each match and joins them together with newlines. Note that this function assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted with triple backticks and the `julia` language identifier. If the code blocks are not correctly formatted, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[120,273],"elapsed":19.235299416,"cost":9.324000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1233573879,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
