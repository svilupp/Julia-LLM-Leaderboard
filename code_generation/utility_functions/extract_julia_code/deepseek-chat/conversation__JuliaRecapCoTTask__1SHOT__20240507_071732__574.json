[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document, removes the code fences, and joins the code blocks with a newline. The function uses regular expressions to find the code blocks and then processes them accordingly.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_blocks = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches\n    matches = match(julia_code_blocks, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code blocks\n    code_blocks = matches.captures\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join with newline\n    joined_code = join(map(block -> strip(block, ['```', '\\n']), code_blocks), '\\n\\n')\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work for the given task. It assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted with triple backticks followed by `julia` to indicate Julia code. If there are multiple code blocks in the markdown document, they will be joined together with a newline in between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[369,270],"elapsed":16.189568833,"cost":0.00012726000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":41382135,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
