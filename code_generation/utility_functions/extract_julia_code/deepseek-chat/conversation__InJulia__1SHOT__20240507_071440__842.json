It then iterates over the matches, strips the code fences (```julia and ```), and joins the code blocks with a newline. The `overlap=true` option in the `eachmatch` function allows for overlapping matches, which is necessary for nested code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[81,275],"elapsed":18.906797667,"cost":8.834e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2105971405,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
