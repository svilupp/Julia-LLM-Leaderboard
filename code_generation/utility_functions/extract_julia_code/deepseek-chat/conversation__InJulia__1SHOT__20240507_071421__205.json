[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that should do what you're asking for. This function uses regular expressions to find and extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the regex in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them with a newline\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression that matches the Julia code blocks in markdown. The `matchall` function is then used to find all occurrences of this pattern in the input markdown string. The captured code blocks are then extracted from the matches and joined together with a newline character to form the final output string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the language identifier \"julia\". If the code blocks are not formatted this way, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[81,306],"elapsed":21.289814917,"cost":9.702e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1511645884,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
