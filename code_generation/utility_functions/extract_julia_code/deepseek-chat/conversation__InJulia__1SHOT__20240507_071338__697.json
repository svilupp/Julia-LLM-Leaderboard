This function uses regular expressions to find the code blocks and then processes them accordingly.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to find code blocks in markdown\n    code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    matches = match(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    while matches !== nothing\n        push!(code_blocks, matches.captures[1])\n        md = md[endof(matches.match):end]\n        matches = match(code_block_regex, md)\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression that matches the code blocks in the markdown. It then iterates over the matches, extracting each code block and storing it in a list. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[81,290],"elapsed":22.107734209,"cost":9.254e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-784985909,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
