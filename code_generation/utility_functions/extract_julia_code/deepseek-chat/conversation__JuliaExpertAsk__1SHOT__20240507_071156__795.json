Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that accomplishes the task described. This function uses regular expressions to find and extract Julia code blocks from the markdown document.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the regex in the markdown string\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code within the code fences and join them with a newline\n    joined_code = join(strip(m.captures[1], '\\n') for m in matches, '\\n\\n')\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It defines a regular expression `julia_code_block_regex` that matches code blocks in markdown. The `[\\s\\S]*?` part is a non-greedy match for any character (including newlines due to the combination of whitespace and non-whitespace characters).\n\n2. It uses the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the regex in the markdown string.\n\n3. It iterates over the matches, strips the code fences (```) and any leading or trailing newlines, and joins the code blocks together with a newline character.\n\n4. Finally, it returns the joined code as a string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the code blocks are correctly formatted with triple backticks followed by `julia` to indicate Julia code. If the code blocks are not consistently formatted, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[120,381],"elapsed":26.871087167,"cost":0.00012348,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1448320419,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
