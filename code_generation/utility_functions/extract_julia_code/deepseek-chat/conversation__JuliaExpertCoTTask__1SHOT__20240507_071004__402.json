Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, flags=DotAll)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove the code fences\n    cleaned_code = replace(joined_code, r\"^```julia\\n|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return cleaned_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the markdown string, joins them with a newline, and then removes the code fences. The `matchall` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the string, and the `replace` function is used to remove the code fences. The `flags=DotAll` argument is used to make the `.` character match any character, including newline.","status":200,"tokens":[208,240],"elapsed":15.00831,"cost":9.632000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1815559102,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
