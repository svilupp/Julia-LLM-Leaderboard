We first check if the input list of events is empty using the `isempty` function. If it is empty, we return \"No events\".\n\n2. We create an empty list called `parsed_events` to store the parsed start and finish times for each event.\n\n3. We iterate over each event in the input list of events. For each event:\n   - We parse the start time using `DateTime(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`, which converts the start time string to a `DateTime` object using the specified format.\n   - Similarly, we parse the finish time using `DateTime(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`.\n   - We append a tuple of the parsed start and finish times to the `parsed_events` list.\n\n4. After parsing all the events, we sort the `parsed_events` list based on the start time of each event using the `sort` function with the `by` parameter set to `x -> x[1]`, which sorts based on the first element of each tuple (start time).\n\n5. We then iterate over the sorted events from index 1 to `length(sorted_events)-1`:\n   - For each event, we check if the finish time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event.\n   - If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\".\n\n6. If we have iterated through all the events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThis function efficiently checks for scheduling conflicts among the given events by parsing the start and finish times, sorting the events based on start time, and checking for overlaps between consecutive events.","status":200,"tokens":[117,613],"elapsed":22.861050875,"cost":0.047729999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4218,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
