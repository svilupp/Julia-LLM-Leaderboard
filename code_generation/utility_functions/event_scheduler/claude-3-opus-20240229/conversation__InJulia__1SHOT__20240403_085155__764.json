We first check if the `events` list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n\n2. We parse the start and finish times of each event using the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package. The format string \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\" specifies the expected format of the date and time strings.\n\n3. We create a new list `parsed_events` that contains tuples of the parsed start and finish times for each event.\n\n4. We sort the `parsed_events` list based on the start time of each event using the `sort` function with a custom comparison function `x -> x[1]`. This ensures that the events are in ascending order of their start times.\n\n5. We iterate over the sorted events starting from index 1 up to the second-to-last event.\n\n6. For each event, we check if its finish time is greater than the start time of the next event. If it is, it means there is an overlap between the two events, and we return \"Conflict\".\n\n7. If we have iterated through all the events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call the `event_scheduler` function with a list of events, where each event is represented as a tuple of start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function will return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, \"Conflict\" if any events overlap, or \"No events\" if the list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[117,555],"elapsed":19.381955583,"cost":0.043379999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18990,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
