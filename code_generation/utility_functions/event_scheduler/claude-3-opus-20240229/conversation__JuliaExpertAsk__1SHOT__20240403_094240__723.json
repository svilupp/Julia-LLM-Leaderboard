First, we check if the `events` list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n2. We create two vectors, `start_times` and `end_times`, to store the start and end times of each event.\n3. We iterate over the `events` list and parse the start and end times of each event using `DateTime` and the specified date format (`\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"`).\n4. We create a permutation `perm` that sorts the `start_times` vector in ascending order.\n5. We apply the permutation to both `start_times` and `end_times` vectors to keep the corresponding start and end times together.\n6. We iterate over the sorted `start_times` vector from index 1 to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of events).\n7. For each event, we check if the start time of the next event is less than the end time of the current event. If it is, it means there is a scheduling conflict, and we return \"Conflict\".\n8. If no conflicts are found after iterating through all events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events, where each event is a tuple containing the start and end times in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\". It uses the Dates package to parse the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects for comparison. The function checks for scheduling conflicts by sorting the events based on their start times and comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[154,646],"elapsed":23.075557708,"cost":0.05075999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10899,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
