The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events as input, where each event is a tuple with a start time and a finish time.\n2. First, it checks if the list of events is empty. If so, it returns \"No events\".\n3. It initializes two vectors, `start_times` and `finish_times`, to store the parsed start and finish times of the events.\n4. It iterates over the events and parses the start and finish times using the `DateTime` function from the Dates package. The `dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"` specifies the expected format of the datetime strings.\n5. It obtains the sorting permutation `perm` based on the start times using `sortperm`. This gives the indices that would sort the start times in ascending order.\n6. It creates new vectors `sorted_start_times` and `sorted_finish_times` by applying the permutation to the original start and finish time vectors. This ensures that the events are sorted based on their start times.\n7. It iterates over the sorted events from index 1 to n-1 (where n is the number of events).\n8. For each event, it checks if the start time of the next event is less than the finish time of the current event. If so, it means there is a scheduling conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n9. If no conflicts are found after iterating through all the events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the start and finish times.","status":200,"tokens":[154,636],"elapsed":21.939697167,"cost":0.05000999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24621,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
