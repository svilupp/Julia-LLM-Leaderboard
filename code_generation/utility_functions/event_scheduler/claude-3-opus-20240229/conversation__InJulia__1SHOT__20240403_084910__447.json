We start by checking if the `events` list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\" since there are no events to schedule.\n\n2. We sort the `events` list based on the start time of each event using the `sort` function with a custom comparison function `by=x -> x[1]`. This ensures that the events are in chronological order.\n\n3. We iterate over the sorted events from index 1 to `length(sorted_events)-1`. For each iteration:\n   - We get the current event (`current_event`) and the next event (`next_event`).\n   - We parse the finish time of the current event (`current_finish`) and the start time of the next event (`next_start`) using the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package.\n   - We compare `current_finish` with `next_start`. If `current_finish` is greater than `next_start`, it means there is an overlap between the events, so we return \"Conflict\".\n\n4. If we complete the loop without finding any conflicts, it means all events can be scheduled without overlaps, so we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: Make sure to import the `Dates` package at the beginning of your code using `using Dates` to enable parsing of the datetime strings.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-06-01 10:00\", \"2023-06-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-06-01 11:00\", \"2023-06-01 13:00\"),\n    (\"2023-06-01 14:00\", \"2023-06-01 16:00\")\n]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-06-01 10:00\", \"2023-06-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-06-01 13:00\", \"2023-06-01 15:00\"),\n    (\"2023-06-01 16:00\", \"2023-06-01 18:00\")\n]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)  # Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function will return \"Conflict\" if there are any overlapping events, \"No conflicts\" if all events can be scheduled without conflicts, and \"No events\" if the input list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[117,772],"elapsed":27.2561305,"cost":0.05965499999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17446,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
