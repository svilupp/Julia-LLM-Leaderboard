It returns:\n- \"No conflicts\" when the events do not overlap \n- \"Conflict\" when events overlap\n- \"No events\" when the input list is empty\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[269,522],"elapsed":22.756756667,"cost":0.043185,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4958,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
