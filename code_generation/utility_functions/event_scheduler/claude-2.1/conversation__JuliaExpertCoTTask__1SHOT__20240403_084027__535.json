Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    times = Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}[]\n    for (start, stop) in events\n        push!(times, (DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(stop, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")))\n    end\n    \n    sorted_times = sort(times, by=x->x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_times)-1\n        if sorted_times[i][2] > sorted_times[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nI first check if the event list is empty, and if so return \"No events\".\n\nThen I parse the start and stop times into DateTime objects and store them in a tuple inside a times array. \n\nI sort the times array by start time.\n\nFinally, I iterate through the times and check if any event's end time is after the next event's start time.
