Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    times = []\n    for (start, stop) in events\n        push!(times, (DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(stop, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")))\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(times)-1\n        t1start, t1stop = times[i]\n        for j in i+1:length(times) \n            t2start, t2stop = times[j]\n            if (t1start <= t2start < t1stop) || (t2start <= t1start < t2stop)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nI first parse the start and stop times into DateTime objects using the Dates package.
