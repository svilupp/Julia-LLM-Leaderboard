[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then sorts the events by their start times and checks for any overlapping events. If it finds any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe `parse_event` function is a helper function that parses an event string into a tuple of `DateTime` objects. It splits the event string into start and finish times and then parses each time string into a `DateTime` object.\n\nThe `events` array contains some example event strings. When you run the code, it should print \"Conflict\" because the events overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[425,530],"elapsed":9.523758041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-354129299,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
