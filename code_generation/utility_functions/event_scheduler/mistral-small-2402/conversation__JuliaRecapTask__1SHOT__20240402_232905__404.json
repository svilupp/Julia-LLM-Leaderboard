[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `event_scheduler` function takes a vector of tuples representing events, sorts them by their start times, and then checks for conflicts by iterating through the sorted events and comparing each event's start time with the previous event's end time. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\" immediately. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input is an empty list, the function returns \"No events\".\n\nThe solution uses the `Dates` package for parsing the date strings and the `sort` function from the standard library for sorting the events. It also uses multiple dispatch by defining the `event_scheduler` function to take a vector of tuples of `Date` objects, which allows the function to work with events represented in any way that can be converted to this format.","status":200,"tokens":[423,736],"elapsed":10.601362041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1199985056,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
