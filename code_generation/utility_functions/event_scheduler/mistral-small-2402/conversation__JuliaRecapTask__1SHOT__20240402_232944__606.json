[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It first converts the input events into a vector of tuples containing `DateTime` objects. Then it sorts the events based on their start times, and checks for any overlapping events. If an event's start time is before the end time of the previous event, it returns \"Conflict\". If all events are non-overlapping, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThis solution assumes that the input events are provided in the correct format. If the format is not guaranteed, additional validation checks would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[423,531],"elapsed":5.840171208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":368897092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
