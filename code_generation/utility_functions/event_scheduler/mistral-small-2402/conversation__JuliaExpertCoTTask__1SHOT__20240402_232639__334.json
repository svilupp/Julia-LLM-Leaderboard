Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Parse the input dates and times using the Dates package.\n   - Sort the events by their start times.\n   - Iterate through the sorted events and check if the current event's start time is later than the previous event's end time.\n   - If there's a conflict, return \"Conflict\" immediately.\n   - If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\".\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_event(event::Tuple{String, String})\n    start = parse(DateTime, event[1], \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\")\n    finish = parse(DateTime, event[2], \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\")\n    return (start, finish)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    parsed_events = [parse_event(event) for event in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    for (i, event) in enumerate(parsed_events[2:end])\n        if event[1] <= parsed_events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result) # Output: No conflicts\n\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:30\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:00\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result) # Output: Conflict\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe code provided above correctly checks for any scheduling conflicts among the given events. The examples provided show that the function returns \"No conflicts\" when there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" when there are overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[304,602],"elapsed":6.694572125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1114473768,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
