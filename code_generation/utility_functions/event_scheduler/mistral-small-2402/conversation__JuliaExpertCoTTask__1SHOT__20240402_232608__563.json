Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Here is a Julia function that checks for scheduling conflicts among a list of events:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and end times of all events\n    parsed_events = [(Date(datetime, \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\"), Date(end_datetime, \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\")) for (datetime, end_datetime) in events]\n\n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it parses the start and end times of all events using the `Date` function from the `Dates` package. It then sorts the events by their start times and checks for conflicts by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next event. If any event overlaps with the next event, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere is how you can use this function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[304,479],"elapsed":10.075484708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1705946594,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
