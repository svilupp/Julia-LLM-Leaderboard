If it is, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n* If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere is an example of how the function could be used:\n```\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events))\n# Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n```\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events))\n# Output: \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[304,679],"elapsed":7.345627417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2085208701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
