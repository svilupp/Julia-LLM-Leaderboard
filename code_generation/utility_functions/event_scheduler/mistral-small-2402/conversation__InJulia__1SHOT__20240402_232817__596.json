It then sorts the events based on their start times. After that, it iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the finish time of one event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event. If it finds any such case, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If an empty list is provided, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,327],"elapsed":3.652094209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1067750730,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
