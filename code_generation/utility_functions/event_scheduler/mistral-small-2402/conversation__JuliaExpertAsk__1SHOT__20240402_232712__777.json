Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_time(time_str)\n    DateTime(time_str, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> parse_time(x[1]))\n    prev_finish = parse_time(first(sorted_events)[2])\n\n    for (start, finish) in sorted_events\n        if parse_time(start) < prev_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        else\n            prev_finish = parse_time(finish)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the events by their start times. Then it checks each event's start time against the previous event's finish time. If an event starts before the previous event finishes, it returns \"Conflict\". If all events have non-overlapping time slots, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[157,267],"elapsed":2.911862417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":927556194,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
