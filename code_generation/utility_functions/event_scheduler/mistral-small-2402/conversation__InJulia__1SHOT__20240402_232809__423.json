This function uses the Dates package to parse the dates and times, and it checks for conflicts by sorting the events by their start times and then comparing the finish time of each event to the start time of the next.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_time(time_str)\n    DateTime(time_str, \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> parse_time(x[1]))\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        current_start = parse_time(sorted_events[i][1])\n        current_finish = parse_time(sorted_events[i][2])\n        next_start = parse_time(sorted_events[i+1][1])\n\n        if current_finish > next_start\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function with a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an event and contains the start and finish times as strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.
