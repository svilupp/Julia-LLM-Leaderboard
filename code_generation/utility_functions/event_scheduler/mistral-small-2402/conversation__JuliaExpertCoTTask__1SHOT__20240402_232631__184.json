It then defines the main function `event_scheduler`, which takes a list of events and checks for any scheduling conflicts. The function first parses the start and finish times of the events, sorts them by start time, and then checks for overlapping events. If no overlapping events are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe code at the end creates a list of events and calls the `event_scheduler` function on it. It should print \"No conflicts\" since the events do not overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[304,488],"elapsed":10.49149125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1137715690,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
