First, I define a helper function `parse_time` to parse the given time string into a DateTime object.\n\n2. Then I define the `event_scheduler` function. If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\n3. Next, I extract the start and end times from each event and sort the events by their start times.\n\n4. I iterate over the sorted events and compare the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event. If there is an overlap (current event's end time is greater than or equal to the next event's start time), I return \"Conflict\".\n\n5. If there are no overlapping events, I return \"No conflicts\".\n\n6. Finally, I test the function with the given data.","status":200,"tokens":[304,532],"elapsed":5.981241166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":208056733,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
