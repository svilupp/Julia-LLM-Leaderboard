Then it iterates through the sorted events, keeping track of the start time and end time of the current event. When it finds a new event, it compares its start and end times to the current event. If the new event starts after the current event ends, it updates the current event to the new event. If the new event starts before the current event ends, it means the two events overlap, so the function returns \"Conflict\". If it successfully iterates through all events without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,629],"elapsed":14.580798708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1893995608,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
