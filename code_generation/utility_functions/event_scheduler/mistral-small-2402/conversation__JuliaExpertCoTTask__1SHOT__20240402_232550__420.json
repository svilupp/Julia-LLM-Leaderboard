Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Think through the approach:\n   - Parse the start and end times using the Dates package\n   - Sort the events by start time\n   - Iterate through the sorted events and compare each event's end time with the next event's start time\n   - If an event's end time is greater than or equal to the next event's start time, return \"Conflict\"\n   - If the loop completes without finding any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\"\n\n2. Write any necessary functions and code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_time(timestr)\n    DateTime(timestr, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> parse_time(x[1]))\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        start1, end1 = parse_time(sorted_events[i][1]), parse_time(sorted_events[i][2])\n        start2, end2 = parse_time(sorted_events[i+1][1]), parse_time(sorted_events[i+1][2])\n\n        if end1 >= start2\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)  # Output: No conflicts\n```\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 12:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)  # Output: Conflict\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input list of events is not empty. If it could potentially be empty, you should add a check for that at the beginning of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[304,614],"elapsed":6.593615708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-635167031,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
