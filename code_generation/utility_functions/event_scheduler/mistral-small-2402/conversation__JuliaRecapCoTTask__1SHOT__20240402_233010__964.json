[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then sorts the events based on their start times, and checks for conflicts by comparing the start and end times of each event with the next event in the sorted list. If the start time of the next event is greater than the end time of the current event, or if they have the same hour and the next event's minute is greater than or equal to the current event's minute, then there is no conflict. If a conflict is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n\nThe solution assumes that the input events are given as a vector of tuples, with each tuple containing two strings representing the start and end times of an event. The solution also assumes that the input events are valid time strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' and that they are already sorted by start time. If these assumptions are not valid, additional error checking and sorting code may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[425,796],"elapsed":8.883764416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1052715644,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
