Here's the code for the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{(<:AbstractString, <:AbstractString)})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    parsed_events = [(Date(event[1], \"yyyy-MM-dd\"), Time(event[2], \"HH:MM\")) for event in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n\n    current_start, current_finish = sorted_events[1]\n    for (event_start, event_finish) in sorted_events[2:end]\n        if event_start < current_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        else\n            current_start, current_finish = event_start, event_finish\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input events into `Date` and `Time` objects. It then sorts the events based on their start times. After that, it iterates through the sorted events and checks for any overlapping events. If an event's start time is less than the current event's finish time, it means that there is an overlapping event, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,369],"elapsed":4.073192625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":955480618,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
