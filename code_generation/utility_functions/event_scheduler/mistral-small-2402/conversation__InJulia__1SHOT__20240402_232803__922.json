It first sorts the events in ascending order based on their start times. Then, it iterates through the sorted events and checks if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous event. If it is, then there's a conflict. If not, it updates the last end time to the current event's end time.\n\nIf you don't have the `Dates` package installed, you can add it using the package manager by typing `] add Dates` in your Julia REPL.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 09:00\", \"2022-01-01 10:00\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 11:00\", \"2022-01-01 12:00\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 10:30\", \"2022-01-01 11:30\")]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: Conflict\n```\n\nIn this example, the third event overlaps with the second event, and so the function returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,515],"elapsed":5.594861916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-874570829,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
