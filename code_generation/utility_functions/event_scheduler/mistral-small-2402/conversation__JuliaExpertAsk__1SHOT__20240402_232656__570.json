If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[157,314],"elapsed":7.050392792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2000207150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
