X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If so, we return \"Conflict\".\n- If the loop completes without finding conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n### Double-Checking the Solution:\n- We ensure to handle various edge cases:\n  - No events (correctly returns \"No events\").\n  - Events with exact end and start times (handled correctly with \">\").\n  - Non-overlapping events.\n  \nThis function efficiently checks for conflicts and adheres to the specifications given in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[368,483],"elapsed":6.453847375,"cost":0.000345,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1775426755,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
