If yes, there's a conflict.\n   - Return \"No conflicts\" if no overlaps are found.\n\n3. **Code Implementation**:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check for no events\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Convert to DateTime and sort events based on start time\n    parsed_events = sort!(map(event -> (DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])), events), by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:(length(parsed_events) - 1)\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i + 1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n4. **Solve the Task**:\nLet's use the function with the provided test case.\n\n```julia\nresult = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\nprintln(result)  # Output should be \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n5. **Check the Solution**:\nThe given events do not overlap:\n- First event ends at \"2023-12-01 11:00\" and the second one starts at \"2023-12-01 11:30\".\nThus, the output \"No conflicts\" is correct.\n\nNow, let's test it with various examples, including cases with conflicts, no events, etc. \n\n```julia\n# Example test cases\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))  # Expected: \"No events\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 09:30\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\")]))  # Expected: \"Conflict\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 12:00\", \"2023-12-01 13:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 13:00\", \"2023-12-01 14:00\")]))  # Expected: \"No conflicts\"\n``` \n\nThis structured approach ensures that the implementation is correct and efficient.","status":200,"tokens":[255,616],"elapsed":7.924751333,"cost":0.00040784999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1964750080,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
