Then, we'll sort the events based on their start times. After that, we'll iterate over the sorted events and check if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous event. If so, there's a scheduling conflict.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse start and end times\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(x[1]), DateTime(x[2])) for x in events]\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] <= parsed_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis should print \"No conflicts\" as the events do not overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[304,404],"elapsed":9.582805041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-314903319,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
