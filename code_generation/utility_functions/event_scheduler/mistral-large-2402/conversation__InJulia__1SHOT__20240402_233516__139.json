[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, it returns \"No events\". If not, it converts each start and finish time from a string to a DateTime object and sorts the events by their start times. Then, it iterates over the events, checking if the start of the current event is before the end of the previous event. If it is, there's a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If the function makes it through all the events without finding a conflict, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,351],"elapsed":8.957664875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2101715620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
