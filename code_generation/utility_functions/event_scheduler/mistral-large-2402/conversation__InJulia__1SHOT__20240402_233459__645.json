This function uses the Dates package for parsing the start and finish times of the events.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = e -> Dates.DateTime(e[1]))\n\n    for i in 1:(length(sorted_events) - 1)\n        # If the start of the next event is before the end of the current one, there's a conflict\n        if Dates.DateTime(sorted_events[i][2]) > Dates.DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the events by their start times. Then it iterates over the sorted list, checking if the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event. If it is, there's a scheduling conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If the function goes through all the events without finding a conflict, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,310],"elapsed":13.578021958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-625003663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
