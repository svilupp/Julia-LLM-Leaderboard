Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If so, there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[304,471],"elapsed":19.462578,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1502814020,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
