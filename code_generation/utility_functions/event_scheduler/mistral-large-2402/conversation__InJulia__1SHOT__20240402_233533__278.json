This function uses the Dates package for parsing the start and finish times of the events.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and end times\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] <= parsed_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". If not, it parses the start and finish times of each event from strings to DateTime objects, then sorts the events by their start times. It then checks each event to see if its start time is before the finish time of the previous event. If it is, it returns \"Conflict\". If it gets through all the events without finding a conflict, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,317],"elapsed":7.51876575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1552918124,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
