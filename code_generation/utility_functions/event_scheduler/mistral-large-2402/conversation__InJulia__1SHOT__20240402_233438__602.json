[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It then sorts the events by start time and checks if the start time of any event is before the end time of the previous event. If it is, then there is a scheduling conflict. If the function makes it through all events without finding a conflict, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,329],"elapsed":7.547173083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":394265365,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
