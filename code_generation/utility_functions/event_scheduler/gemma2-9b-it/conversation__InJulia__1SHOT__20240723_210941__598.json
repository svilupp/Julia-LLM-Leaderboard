This ensures that events are compared based on their actual start times.\n4. **Iterate and check for overlap:**\n   - The code iterates through the sorted events using a `for` loop, comparing each event with its subsequent event.\n   - Inside the loop:\n     - `start_time = parse(ISOFormats.RFC3339(events_sorted[i][1]))` and `end_time = parse(ISOFormats.RFC3339(events_sorted[i + 1][1]))` parse the start and end times of the current and next events.\n     - `if start_time < end_time` checks if the start time of the current event is less than the end time of the previous event. If this condition is true, it means there's an overlap, and the function immediately returns `\"Conflict\"`.\n5. **No conflicts:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, the function returns `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or want to explore more advanced scheduling algorithms!","status":200,"tokens":[117,602],"elapsed":1.506856208,"cost":0.0001438,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-254969136,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
