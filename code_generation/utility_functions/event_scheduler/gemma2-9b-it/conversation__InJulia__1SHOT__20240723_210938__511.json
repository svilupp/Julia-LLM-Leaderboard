If so, it returns \"No events\".\n   - **Sorting:** It sorts the events based on their start times using `sort` and the `Dates.parse` function to convert the strings to `DateAndTime` objects.\n   - **Iteration and Comparison:** It iterates through the sorted events, comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event.\n   - **Conflict Detection:** If the current event's end time is later than the next event's start time, it indicates an overlap, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n   - **No Conflicts:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\n3. **Example Usage:**\n   - Two example event lists are created, one with conflicts and one without.\n   - The `event_scheduler` function is called on each list, and the results are printed.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Dates Parsing:** The `Dates.parse` function is essential for converting the string representations of dates and times into `DateAndTime` objects that can be compared.\n- **Sorting:** Sorting the events by start time simplifies the overlap checking process.","status":200,"tokens":[117,810],"elapsed":1.885229583,"cost":0.00018539999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-669801310,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
