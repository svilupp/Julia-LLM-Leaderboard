[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If so, we return \"No events\". \n4. **Sorting:**  We sort the events based on their start times using `sort`. This simplifies the conflict detection process.\n5. **Iteration:** We iterate through the sorted events, comparing each event's end time with the start time of the next event.\n6. **Conflict Detection:** If the start time of the next event is less than or equal to the current event's end time, it indicates an overlap, and we immediately return \"Conflict\".\n7. **No Conflicts:** If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see this function tested with some example events!","status":200,"tokens":[388,397],"elapsed":1.051524208,"cost":0.000157,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":8892119,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
