Import the Dates package\n2. Define a function to parse the date-time strings\n3. Create the main `event_scheduler` function\n4. Sort the events by start time\n5. Check for conflicts by comparing adjacent events\n6. Return the appropriate result\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Function to parse date-time strings\nfunction parse_datetime(dt_string::String)\n    return DateTime(dt_string, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse and sort events by start time\n    parsed_events = [(parse_datetime(start), parse_datetime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nLet's check if the solution is correct:\n\n1. It handles the empty list case by returning \"No events\".\n2. It parses the date-time strings correctly using the Dates package.\n3. It sorts the events by start time to efficiently check for conflicts.\n4. It compares adjacent events to detect any overlap.\n5. It returns \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found, and \"No conflicts\" otherwise.\n\nThe solution should work correctly for the given example and other possible scenarios. To further verify, we can test with additional cases:\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))  # Should print \"No events\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:00\", \"2023-12-01 12:00\")]))  # Should print \"Conflict\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\")]))  # Should print \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThese additional tests cover the edge cases and should confirm that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[269,642],"elapsed":8.400343959,"cost":0.010437,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11067,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
