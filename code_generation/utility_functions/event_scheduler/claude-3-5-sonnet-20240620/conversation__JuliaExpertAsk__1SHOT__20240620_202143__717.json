Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise and efficient Julia function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = e -> DateTime(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") > DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function:\n1.
