Parse the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects using the Dates package.\n2. Sort the events by their start times.\n3. Iterate through the sorted events and check if any event's start time is before the previous event's finish time.\n4. Return \"Conflict\" if any overlaps are detected, otherwise return \"No conflicts\".\n5. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # Expected: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. **Checking for empty list**: If the input event list is empty, return \"No events\".\n2. **Parsing dates**: Convert the date-time strings into `DateTime` objects for better manipulation.\n3. **Sorting events**: Sort the events primarily by their start times.\n4. **Checking for conflicts**: Loop through the sorted list and compare whether any event's start time is before the previous event's finish time.\n5. **Return results**: Return \"Conflict\" if an overlap is found, else \"No conflicts\".\n\nNow, let's ensure the function works correctly by testing with the provided data. \n\n```julia\n# Additional test cases for thorough testing\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))  # Expected: \"No events\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # Expected: \"Conflict\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 12:00\", \"2023-12-01 13:00\")]))  # Expected: \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[255,587],"elapsed":7.186650041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":781710567,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
