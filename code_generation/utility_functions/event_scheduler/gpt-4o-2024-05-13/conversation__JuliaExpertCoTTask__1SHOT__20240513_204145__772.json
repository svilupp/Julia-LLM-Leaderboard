Import the `Dates` package for date and time parsing.\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function.\n3. Check if the list is empty and return \"No events\" if so.\n4. Parse start and finish times of each event using `Dates.DateTime`.\n5. Sort the events by their start times.\n6. Iterate through the events and check for overlaps by comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event.\n7. Return \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found; otherwise, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's the complete solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    # Check if events list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse events into (start, finish) tuples of DateTime\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for event in events]\n    \n    # Sort events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:(length(sorted_events) - 1)\n        current_event_end = sorted_events[i][2]\n        next_event_start = sorted_events[i + 1][1]\n        \n        if current_event_end > next_event_start\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with given data\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `Dates.DateTime(event, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")` function parses the date-time string into a `DateTime` object.\n- The events are sorted by their start times to easily check if one event's end time is after the next event's start time.\n- The condition `current_event_end > next_event_start` checks if there's any overlap between consecutive events.\n\n### Test Case\nThe provided test case has no conflicts since the second event starts after the first event ends. Hence, running this code will output \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[255,523],"elapsed":4.79308,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":48772759,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
