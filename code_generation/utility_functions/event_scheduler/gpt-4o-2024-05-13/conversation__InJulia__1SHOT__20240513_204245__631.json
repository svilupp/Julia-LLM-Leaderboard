Here is a function `event_scheduler` that does that:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(e[1], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(e[2], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for e in events]\n    \n    # Sort events by their start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i-1][2] > sorted_events[i][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Dates Package**: The `Dates` package is imported to help with date-time parsing.\n2. **Return Early if No Events**: The function immediately checks if the events list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is.\n3. **Parsing Events**: Each event's start and finish time are parsed from `String` to `DateTime` objects using the specified date format.\n4. **Sorting Events**: The events are sorted by their start times to make it easier to check for overlaps.\n5. **Checking for Conflicts**: We iterate through the sorted events and check if the finish time of the current event overlaps with the start time of the next event.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01 12:00\", \"2023-01-01 13:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01 13:30\", \"2023-01-01 14:30\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01 11:30\", \"2023-01-01 12:30\")  # This event overlaps with the second one\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Should print \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nThis function will help you determine whether there are any scheduling conflicts among the provided list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[111,498],"elapsed":5.768931375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1231025651,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
