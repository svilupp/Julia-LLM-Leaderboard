Parse the event times using the `Dates` package.\n2. Sort the events by their start times.\n3. Check for any overlaps between consecutive events.\n4. Return appropriate messages based on the presence or absence of conflicts.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(sorted_events) - 1)\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output should be \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Parsing Events:** Convert the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects.\n2. **Sorting Events:** Sort the events by their start times.\n3. **Checking Overlaps:** Iterate through the sorted events and check if the finish time of any event overlaps with the start time of the next event.\n4. **Return Results:** Return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlaps, \"Conflict\" if any overlaps are detected, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\nCheck the provided example for correctness by running the function and verifying the output.","status":200,"tokens":[255,387],"elapsed":3.67686,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1647659094,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
