If it is, the function returns \"No events\". Then, it sorts the events by their start times. Finally, it iterates through the sorted events, checking if each event starts before the previous event ends. If it finds any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[115,450],"elapsed":2.144297,"cost":0.00042334999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-224319779,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
