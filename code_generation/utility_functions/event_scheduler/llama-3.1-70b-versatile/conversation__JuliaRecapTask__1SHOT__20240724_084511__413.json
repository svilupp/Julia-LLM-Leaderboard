[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it is, the function returns \"No events\". Then, it sorts the events by their start times. It initializes the end time of the last event to be the end time of the first event. Then, it iterates over the events starting from the second event. For each event, it checks if the start time of the current event is less than the end time of the last event. If it is, the function returns \"Conflict\". If not, it updates the end time of the last event to be the end time of the current event. If the function iterates over all events without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[373,561],"elapsed":2.798347542,"cost":0.0006632599999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1024452399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
