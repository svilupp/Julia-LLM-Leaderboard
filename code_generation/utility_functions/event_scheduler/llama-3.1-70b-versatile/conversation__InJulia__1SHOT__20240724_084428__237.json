We first check if the input list `events` is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n2. We sort the events by their start times. This is necessary because we want to check for conflicts between adjacent events in the sorted list.\n3. We iterate over the sorted events, starting from the second event (since we have no previous event to compare with).\n4. For each event, we parse the start and end times of the current and previous events using the `DateTime` constructor.\n5. We check if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous event. If it is, we have a conflict, and we return \"Conflict\".\n6. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```julia\n# No conflicts\nevents = [\n    (\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 11:30\", \"2022-01-01 12:30\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 14:00\", \"2022-01-01 15:00\")\n]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No conflicts\n\n# Conflict\nevents = [\n    (\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 10:30\", \"2022-01-01 12:30\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 14:00\", \"2022-01-01 15:00\")\n]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: Conflict\n\n# No events\nevents = []\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No events\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,687],"elapsed":3.106496416,"cost":0.0006105799999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1181902422,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
