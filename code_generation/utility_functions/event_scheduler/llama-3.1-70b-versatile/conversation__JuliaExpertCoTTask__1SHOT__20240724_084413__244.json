It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events by their start times. Finally, it checks for conflicts by iterating over the sorted events and comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If it finds a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[259,294],"elapsed":1.669800583,"cost":0.00038506999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-325967830,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
