If it is, the function returns \"No events\". Then, it sorts the events by their start times. Finally, it iterates over the sorted events, checking if the start time of each event is before the end time of the previous event. If it finds any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[115,433],"elapsed":2.205075792,"cost":0.00040992,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":274606824,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
