It then parses the start and finish times of each event using the `Date` and `Time` functions from the `Dates` package. The events are sorted by their start times, and then the function checks for any scheduling conflicts by iterating through the sorted list of events and comparing the start and finish times of each event with the start and finish times of the next event. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[313,414],"elapsed":22.604215083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-289872331,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
