[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then, it parses the start and finish times of each event using the `Date` and `Time` constructors from the `Dates` package. The events are then sorted by their start times.\n\nThe function then checks for any scheduling conflicts by iterating over the sorted list of events. If the start time of the current event is the same as the start time of the next event, it checks if the finish time of the current event is after the start time of the next event and if the finish time of the next event is before the finish time of the current event. If both conditions are true, there is a conflict. If the start time of the current event is before the start time of the next event and the finish time of the current event is after the start time of the next event, there is also a conflict. If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[434,553],"elapsed":30.852950792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-922595267,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
