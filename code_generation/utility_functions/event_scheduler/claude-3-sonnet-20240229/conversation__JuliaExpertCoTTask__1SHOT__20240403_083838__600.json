It first checks if the list is empty, and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events by their start times using the `sort` function with a custom comparator.\n\nNext, it iterates through the sorted events using a `for` loop. For each pair of consecutive events, it compares the end time of the first event with the start time of the second event. If the end time of the first event is after the start time of the second event, it means there is an overlap, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any overlap, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: The `DateTime` objects are created using the string format \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\" to parse the input tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[269,555],"elapsed":9.854118708,"cost":0.009132000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10832,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
