[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Parse the input event strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package.\n2. Sort the events by start time in ascending order.\n3. Iterate through the sorted events, comparing the start time of the next event with the end time of the current event. If the next event starts before the current event ends, there is a conflict.\n4. If no conflicts are found after iterating through all events, return \"No conflicts\".\n5. Handle the empty list case by returning \"No events\".\n\nThe function uses type annotations like `AbstractString` for generality and relies on the standard `Dates` package for date/time parsing and comparisons.","status":200,"tokens":[405,644],"elapsed":11.310164,"cost":0.010875,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27972,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
