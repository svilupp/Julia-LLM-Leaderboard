Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The function first checks if the input list is empty, returning \"No events\" if so.\n2. It then parses the start and end times for each event using the DateTime constructor from the Dates package.\n3. The parsed events are sorted by their start time.\n4. The function then iterates over the sorted events, checking if the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event. If so, it returns \"Conflict\".\n5. If no conflicts are found after iterating through all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe key steps are:\n- Parse the input times into DateTime objects\n- Sort the events by start time\n- Iterate over the sorted events, checking for overlaps between consecutive events\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of events. However, it only requires a single pass through the sorted events to check for conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[269,462],"elapsed":10.359095958,"cost":0.007737000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3783,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
