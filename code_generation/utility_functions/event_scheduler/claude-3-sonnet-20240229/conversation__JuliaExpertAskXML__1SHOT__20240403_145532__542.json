Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events = sort(events, by=x -> x[1]) # sort by start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        curr_start, curr_end = DateTime.(events[i], \"YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        next_start, next_end = DateTime.(events[i+1], \"YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n        if next_start < curr_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `events` is empty, and if so, returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events by their start times using the `sort` function with a custom sorting function.\n\nThen, it iterates through the sorted list of events using a `for` loop. For each pair of consecutive events, it converts the start and end times to `DateTime` objects using the `DateTime` function and the specified format string. If the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event, it means there is a conflict, so the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list of events is well-formed, with each event represented as a tuple of two strings in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[159,343],"elapsed":7.539523208,"cost":0.005622,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10427,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
