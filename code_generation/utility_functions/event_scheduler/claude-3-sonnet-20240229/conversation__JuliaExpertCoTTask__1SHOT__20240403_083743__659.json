Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events = sort(events)  # Sort events by start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, end1 = parse.(DateTime, events[i], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        start2, end2 = parse.(DateTime, events[i+1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n        if start2 < end1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n# Output: No conflicts\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Import the `Dates` package for parsing date-time strings.\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function that takes a list of tuples representing events.\n3. If the list is empty, return `\"No events\"`.\n4. Sort the events by their start time.\n5. Iterate through the sorted events and check for overlap between consecutive events.\n6. Parse the start and end times of the current and next events using `parse.(DateTime, ...)`.\n7. If the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event, return `\"Conflict\"`.\n8. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, return `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nThe sorting step ensures that events are processed in chronological order, making it easier to detect overlaps between consecutive events.","status":200,"tokens":[269,404],"elapsed":7.720176833,"cost":0.006867,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17642,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
