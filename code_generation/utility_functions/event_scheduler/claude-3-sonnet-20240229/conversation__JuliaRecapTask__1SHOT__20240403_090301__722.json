[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end times of an event.\n2. If the list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n3. The events are sorted by their start times using the `sort` function with a custom sorting function `by=x->x[1]`.\n4. The function iterates through the sorted events from the first to the second-to-last event.\n5. For each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the finish time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event.\n6. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n7. If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe key steps are:\n- Sort the events by start time\n- Check for overlaps by comparing the finish time of the current event with the start time of the next event\n- Return \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found, \"No conflicts\" if no overlaps, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\nNote: The solution uses the `DateTime` type from the `Dates` package to represent the event times. You may need to adjust the date/time formats based on your input data.","status":200,"tokens":[404,652],"elapsed":12.285536125,"cost":0.010992,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1261,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
