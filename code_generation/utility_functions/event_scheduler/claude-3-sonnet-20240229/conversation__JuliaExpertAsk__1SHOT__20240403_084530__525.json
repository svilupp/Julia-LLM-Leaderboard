Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(events[i], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        start2, finish2 = DateTime.(events[i+1], dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        if start2 < finish1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". If not, it sorts the events by their start time.\n\nIt then iterates over the sorted list of events, and for each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the start time of the second event is before the finish time of the first event. If that's the case, it means there's a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that the function uses the `DateTime` type from the `Dates` package to parse the string representations of the event times. The `dateformat` string specifies the format of the input strings.","status":200,"tokens":[154,331],"elapsed":6.605797709,"cost":0.0054269999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30340,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
