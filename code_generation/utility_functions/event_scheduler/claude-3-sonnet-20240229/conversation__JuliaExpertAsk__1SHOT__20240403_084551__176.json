Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Here's how it works:\n\n1. If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n2. The events are sorted in ascending order based on their start times.\n3. The function iterates through the sorted events using a loop.\n4. For each pair of consecutive events, the start and finish times are parsed into DateTime objects using the `DateTime` function from the Dates package.\n5. If the start time of the second event is before the finish time of the first event, it means there is an overlap, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n6. If the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[154,339],"elapsed":6.2402255,"cost":0.005547,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
