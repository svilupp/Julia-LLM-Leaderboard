We import the `Dates` package to handle date/time parsing and operations.\n2. The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish time in string format `\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"`.\n3. If the list is empty, we return `\"No events\"`.\n4. We use nested loops to check all pairs of events for overlaps.\n5. For each pair of events, we parse the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects using the `DateTime` function from `Dates`.\n6. We check if either event's start time is less than or equal to the other event's finish time, and the other event's start time is less than or equal to the first event's finish time. If this condition is true, it means the two events overlap in time, so we return `\"Conflict\"`.\n7. If the nested loops complete without finding any conflicts, we return `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nNote that we use the `\"y-m-dTH:M\"` format string when parsing the date/time strings because `Dates` expects a format compatible with the ISO 8601 standard.","status":200,"tokens":[159,471],"elapsed":8.428854125,"cost":0.007542,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8784,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
