[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples representing events, where each tuple contains the start and end time in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\".\n2. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n3. The events are sorted by their start time using `sort(events, by=x->x[1])`.\n4. The function iterates over the sorted events using a `for` loop.\n5. For each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the start time of the second event is before the end time of the first event.\n6. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\" and exits the function.\n7. If the loop completes without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe solution uses the `Dates` module to parse the date-time strings into `DateTime` objects. The comparison of `DateTime` objects is performed automatically by Julia, making it easy to check for overlapping events.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input event tuples are valid date-time strings in the specified format. If the input format varies, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[404,579],"elapsed":11.419318208,"cost":0.009897,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24693,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
