Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    sort!(events, by=x->x[1]) # Sort events by start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = events[i]\n        start2, finish2 = events[i+1]\n\n        if finish1 > start2\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `events` is empty, and if so, returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events by their start times using the `sort!` function.\n\nThen, it iterates over the sorted list of events using a `for` loop. For each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the finish time of the first event is greater than the start time of the second event. If so, there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that the function assumes that the input tuples are in the correct format ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM') as specified in the problem statement, and that the `Dates` module is used to parse the strings into `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[159,305],"elapsed":7.565014625,"cost":0.005052,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4288,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
