Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We import the `Dates` package for parsing date/time strings.\n2. The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples `(start_time, finish_time)`.\n3. If the list is empty, we return `\"No events\"`.\n4. We sort the list of events by start time.\n5. We loop through adjacent pairs of events.\n6. For each pair, we check if the start time of the second event is between the start and finish times of the first event.\n7. If there is an overlap, we return `\"Conflict\"`.\n8. If we make it through the entire list without finding a conflict, we return `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-05-01 09:00\", \"2023-05-01 11:00\"), \n          (\"2023-05-01 10:00\", \"2023-05-01 12:00\"), # conflicts with previous\n          (\"2023-05-02 14:00\", \"2023-05-02 16:00\")]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: Conflict\n\nevents = [(\"2023-05-01 09:00\", \"2023-05-01 11:00\"),\n          (\"2023-05-01 12:00\", \"2023-05-01 13:00\")]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[159,468],"elapsed":9.170223917,"cost":0.007497,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7142,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
