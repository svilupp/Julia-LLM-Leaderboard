Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    events = sort(events) do (start1, finish1), (start2, finish2)\n        start1 < start2 ? (-1, 1) : (start1 > start2 ? (1, -1) : 0)\n    end\n\n    previous_finish = DateTime(0)\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        start = DateTime(start, DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        finish = DateTime(finish, DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        if start < previous_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        previous_finish = finish\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `events` list is empty, and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events in chronological order using a custom sorting function.\n\nNext, it iterates through the sorted events. For each event, it converts the start and finish times from strings to `DateTime` objects using the `DateFormat` utility. If the current event's start time is earlier than the previous event's finish time, it means there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after iterating through all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: The custom sorting function sorts the events first by start time in ascending order, and then by finish time in descending order. This ensures that events with the same start time are sorted with the longer event first, which is necessary for the conflict detection logic to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[154,380],"elapsed":9.184972125,"cost":0.006162,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23005,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
