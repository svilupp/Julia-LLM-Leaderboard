Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    events = sort(events) do (start1, finish1), (start2, finish2)\n        start1 < start2\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(events[i], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        start2, finish2 = DateTime.(events[i+1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        if finish1 > start2\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `events` is empty, and returns `\"No events\"` if it is. Otherwise, it sorts the events in ascending order by their start times.\n\nThen, it iterates over the sorted list of events, comparing the finish time of each event with the start time of the next event. If the finish time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event, it means there is a conflict, and the function returns `\"Conflict\"`.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nNote that we use the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times, which are assumed to be in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\".","status":200,"tokens":[154,336],"elapsed":6.694577625,"cost":0.005502,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21027,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
