Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If not, it proceeds to parse the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects using the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package. The events are then sorted in chronological order based on their start times.\n\nThe function then iterates over the sorted events list, checking for any overlap between consecutive events. If the finish time of the current event is later than the start time of the next event, it means there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[159,252],"elapsed":5.467017541,"cost":0.004257,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18010,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
