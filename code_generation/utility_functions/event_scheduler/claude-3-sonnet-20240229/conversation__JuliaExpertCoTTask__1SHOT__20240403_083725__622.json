The function first checks if the list of events is empty, and if so, returns \"No events\".\n2. It then parses the start and end times of each event using the `DateTime` constructor from the `Dates` package.\n3. The list of parsed events is sorted by start time in ascending order.\n4. The function then iterates through the sorted list of events, checking if the end time of the current event overlaps with the start time of the next event. If an overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned.\n5. If no overlap is found after checking all events, \"No conflicts\" is returned.\n\nNote: The function assumes that the input list of events is correctly formatted, with each event represented as a tuple of two strings in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[269,432],"elapsed":8.040162334,"cost":0.007287,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24171,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
