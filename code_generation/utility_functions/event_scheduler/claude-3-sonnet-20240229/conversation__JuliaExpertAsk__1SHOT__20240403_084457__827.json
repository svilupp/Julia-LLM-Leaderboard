Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")))\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        start1, end1 = DateTime.(sorted_events[i], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        start2, end2 = DateTime.(sorted_events[i+1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n\n        if start2 < end1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the `event_scheduler` function works:\n\n1. If the `events` vector is empty, return \"No events\".\n2. Sort the `events` vector by the start time of each event, using the `sort` function and a lambda to convert the start time string to a `DateTime` object.\n3. Iterate over the sorted events vector, comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event.\n4. If the start time of the current event is earlier than the end time of the previous event, there is a conflict, so return \"Conflict\".\n5. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package is used to parse the string representations of the start and end times. The `DateFormat` macro is used to specify the format of the input strings.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input events are valid (i.e., the start time is earlier than the end time for each event). If this is not guaranteed, additional checks may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[154,418],"elapsed":7.664266042,"cost":0.006732,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6484,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
