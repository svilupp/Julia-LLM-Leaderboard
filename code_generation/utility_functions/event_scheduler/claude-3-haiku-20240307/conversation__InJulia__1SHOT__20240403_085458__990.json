If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n2. The function converts the start and end times of each event from strings to `DateTime` objects using the `DateTime` function and the date/time format `\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"`.\n3. The function then checks for any overlapping events by iterating through all pairs of events and checking if the start time of one event is before the end time of the other event, and the end time of the first event is after the start time of the second event.\n4. If any such overlapping events are found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere are some examples of using the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-03-01 10:00\", \"2023-03-01 11:30\"), (\"2023-03-01 11:00\", \"2023-03-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: Conflict\n\nevents = [(\"2023-03-01 10:00\", \"2023-03-01 11:30\"), (\"2023-03-01 12:00\", \"2023-03-01 13:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No conflicts\n\nevents = []\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No events\n```","status":200,"tokens":[117,528],"elapsed":4.743234209,"cost":0.0006892500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1489,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
