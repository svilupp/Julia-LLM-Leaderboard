We first check if the input list of events is empty, and if so, return \"No events\".\n2. We convert the start and end times of each event from strings to `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package.\n3. We then iterate through all pairs of events and check if the start time of one event is less than the end time of another event. If we find any such pair, we return \"Conflict\".\n4. If we don't find any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe solution follows the provided approach and uses the `Dates` package to parse the event times. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of events, as we need to check all pairs of events for conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[269,625],"elapsed":6.429260458,"cost":0.0008485000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17032,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
