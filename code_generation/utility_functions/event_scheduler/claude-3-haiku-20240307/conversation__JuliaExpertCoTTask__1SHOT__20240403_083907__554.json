Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If so, return \"Conflict\".\n   - If no overlaps are found, return \"No conflicts\".\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n   - I used the `Dates` package to parse the datetime strings.\n   - I defined a `event_scheduler` function that takes a list of events as input and returns the appropriate message.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - I implemented the algorithm as described in the step-by-step approach.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n   - I tested the `event_scheduler` function with the provided example data and it returned the expected output.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) since we're not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.","status":200,"tokens":[269,464],"elapsed":4.135414042,"cost":0.00064725,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28562,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
