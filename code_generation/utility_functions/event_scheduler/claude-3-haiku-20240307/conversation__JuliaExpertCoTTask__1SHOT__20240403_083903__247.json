Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If any overlap is found, I return \"Conflict\".\n   - If no conflicts are found, I return \"No conflicts\".\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n   - I use the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times of the events.\n   - I implement the `event_scheduler` function as described above.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events (represented as tuples of start and finish times) and returns the appropriate message based on whether there are any scheduling conflicts.\n\n4. **Check that the solution is correct**:\n   - The provided example data is correctly handled by the `event_scheduler` function.","status":200,"tokens":[269,467],"elapsed":4.900052417,"cost":0.0006510000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25195,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
