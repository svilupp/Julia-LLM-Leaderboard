The function `event_scheduler` takes a vector of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with a start and finish time.\n2. If the input vector is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n3. The function creates two vectors: `start_times` and `end_times`, which store the start and end times of the events as `DateTime` objects.\n4. The function then checks for any overlapping events by iterating through the `start_times` and `end_times` vectors and checking if the start time of one event is less than or equal to the end time of another event.\n5. If an overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[159,399],"elapsed":3.767005333,"cost":0.0005385,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22746,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
