Check if the list of events is empty and return \"No events\" if so.\n2. Sort the events by start time using the `sorted_by_start_time` function.\n3. Iterate through the sorted events and check if the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event. If so, return \"Conflict\".\n4. If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `sorted_by_start_time` function is a helper function that sorts the events by their start time.","status":200,"tokens":[303,503],"elapsed":4.471167125,"cost":0.0007045,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":0,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
