If it is, we return \"No events\".\n   - Next, we sort the events by their start time to make it easier to check for overlapping events.\n   - Then, we iterate through the sorted list of events and check if the start time of the next event is before the finish time of the current event. If so, we return \"Conflict\".\n   - If we finish the loop without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n   - We use the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times of the events.\n   - The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events (each event is a tuple with a start and finish time) and returns the result (\"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\").\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - The function checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events and returns the appropriate result.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n   - The example usage at the end of the code shows that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[269,518],"elapsed":5.279651208,"cost":0.0007147500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15494,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
