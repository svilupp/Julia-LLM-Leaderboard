Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Check if the input list is empty, and return \"No events\" in that case.\n2. Convert the start and end times of each event to `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package.\n3. Iterate through all pairs of events and check if their time ranges overlap. If any overlap is found, return \"Conflict\".\n4. If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of events, as we need to check for conflicts between every pair of events.","status":200,"tokens":[159,338],"elapsed":3.445793125,"cost":0.00046225000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9948,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
