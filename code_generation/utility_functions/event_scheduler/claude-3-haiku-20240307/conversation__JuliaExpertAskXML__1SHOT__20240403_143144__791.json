If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n2. The events are sorted by their start time using the `sort` function and the `by` keyword.\n3. The function then iterates through the sorted events and checks if the end time of the previous event is greater than the start time of the current event. If so, it means there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n4. If the function completes the loop without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `Dates` package is used for parsing the event times.","status":200,"tokens":[159,289],"elapsed":3.018910834,"cost":0.00040100000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-733,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
