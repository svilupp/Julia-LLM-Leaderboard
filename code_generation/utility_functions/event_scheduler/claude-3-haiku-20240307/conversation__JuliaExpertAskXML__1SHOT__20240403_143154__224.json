It then parses the start and end times of each event using the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` package.\n\nThe function then uses a nested loop to check for any overlapping events. For each pair of events, it checks if the start time of one event is less than or equal to the end time of the other event, and the end time of the first event is greater than or equal to the start time of the other event. If any such overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[159,359],"elapsed":3.677682042,"cost":0.0004885,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
