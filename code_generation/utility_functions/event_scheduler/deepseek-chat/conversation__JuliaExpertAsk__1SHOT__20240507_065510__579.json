Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia that uses the Dates package to parse the date and time strings and check for conflicts:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            start_i = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            end_i = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            start_j = DateTime(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            end_j = DateTime(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n            if start_i <= end_j && start_j <= end_i\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all pairs of events and checks if the start time of one event is before the end time of another event and vice versa.
