[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it completes the loop without finding any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[112,450],"elapsed":26.476158834,"cost":0.00014168,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1067914258,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
