Define the `event_scheduler` function.\n2. Parse the start and finish times of each event using the `Dates` package.\n3. Sort the events by their start time.\n4. Iterate through the sorted events and check for overlaps.\n5. Return the appropriate message based on whether conflicts are found.\n\nLet's implement the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and finish times of each event\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])) for event in events]\n\n    # Sort the events by their start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for overlaps\n    for i in 1:(length(sorted_events) - 1)\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i + 1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis function will return \"No conflicts\" for the given data, as there are no overlapping events. If you want to test it with conflicting events, you can modify the input list accordingly. For example:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis will return \"Conflict\" because the second event overlaps with the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[295,509],"elapsed":33.667878459,"cost":0.00018382,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":385703163,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
