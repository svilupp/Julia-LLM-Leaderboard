Each event is represented as a tuple with a start and finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function uses the `Dates` package for parsing the datetime strings.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the datetime strings\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-10-01 09:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 10:30\", \"2023-10-01 11:30\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 11:00\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check for Empty List**: If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".\n2. **Parse DateTime Strings**: The function converts the start and finish times from strings to `DateTime` objects using the `DateTime` constructor from the `Dates` package.\n3. **Sort Events**: The events are sorted by their start times.\n4. **Check for Conflicts**: The function iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the end time of the current event is after the start time of the next event. If such a condition is found, it returns \"Conflict\".\n5. **No Conflicts**: If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThis function ensures that any overlapping events are detected and reported appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[116,567],"elapsed":13.291850708,"cost":0.005451,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1457008858,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
