Each event is represented as a tuple with a start and a finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function uses the `Dates` package for parsing the date and time strings.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the event times\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-10-01 10:00\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 13:00\", \"2023-10-01 15:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 14:00\", \"2023-10-01 16:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check for Empty List**: The function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if true.\n2. **Parse Event Times**: It parses the start and finish times of each event using the `DateTime` constructor from the `Dates` package.\n3. **Sort Events**: The events are sorted by their start times.\n4. **Check for Conflicts**: The function iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the finish time of the current event overlaps with the start time of the next event. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\".\n5. **No Conflicts**: If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThis function ensures that any scheduling conflicts are detected and reported accurately.","status":200,"tokens":[116,566],"elapsed":12.645799,"cost":0.005442000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1984742307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
