Each event is represented as a tuple with a start and finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function uses the `Dates` package for parsing the date and time strings.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the date strings into DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-10-01 08:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 10:30\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 12:30\", \"2023-10-01 14:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No conflicts\n\nevents_with_conflict = [\n    (\"2023-10-01 08:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 09:30\", \"2023-10-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 12:30\", \"2023-10-01 14:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events_with_conflict))  # Output: Conflict\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Parsing Dates**: The function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n2. **Parsing and Sorting**: It then parses the date strings into `DateTime` objects and sorts the events by their start times.\n3. **Checking for Conflicts**: The function iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the end time of the current event is after the start time of the next event. If it finds any such overlap, it returns \"Conflict\".\n4. **No Conflicts**: If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThis function ensures that any scheduling conflicts are detected and reported correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[116,699],"elapsed":14.685530209,"cost":0.006639000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-664918560,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
