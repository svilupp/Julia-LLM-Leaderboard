We parse these strings to `DateTime` objects with the `DateTime` constructor using a list comprehension. This creates a list of tuples with parsed `DateTime` objects.\n\n3. **Sorting Events:**\n   - To simplify the checking for overlaps, we sort the events by their start time using the `sort` function.\n\n4. **Checking for Overlaps:**\n   - We then iterate over the sorted events. For each event, we check if the current event's start time is before the previous event's finish time. If this condition is met, it indicates an overlap, and the function returns `\"Conflict\"`.\n\n5. **No Conflicts:**\n   - If we iterate through all the events without finding any overlaps, we return `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-10-01 10:00\", \"2023-10-01 11:00\"), \n          (\"2023-10-01 11:15\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\"),\n          (\"2023-10-01 12:00\", \"2023-10-01 13:00\"),\n          (\"2023-10-01 09:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:30\")]  # Overlaps with first event\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Outputs: \"Conflict\"\n\nno_conflict_events = [(\"2023-10-01 10:00\", \"2023-10-01 11:00\"), \n                      (\"2023-10-01 11:15\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\"),\n                      (\"2023-10-01 12:15\", \"2023-10-01 13:00\")]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(no_conflict_events))  # Outputs: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function should work well for checking conflicts in a list of events based on their start and finish times.","status":200,"tokens":[111,684],"elapsed":7.755797542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2044876576,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
