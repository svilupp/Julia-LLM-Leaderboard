X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If the end time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event, there is an overlap, and we return \"Conflict\".\n\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles an empty list of events and returns \"No events\".\n\n### Double-check:\n- **Correct `DateTime` format**: Ensure the date format is `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM` which matches the given problem's input.\n- **Correct overlap logic**: Ensure that `current_end > next_start` effectively detects any overlap.\n\nThis solution should work efficiently and correctly for any provided list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[368,658],"elapsed":6.80636275,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":58763171,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
