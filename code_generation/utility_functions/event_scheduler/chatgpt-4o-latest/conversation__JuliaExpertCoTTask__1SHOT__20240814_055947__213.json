Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Function to check for scheduling conflicts among events\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse the start and finish times into DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    \n    # Sort events by their start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for any conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i + 1][1]  # If an event's finish time is after the next event's start time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Step 1**: Check if the input list of events is empty. If it is empty, return \"No events\".\n- **Step 2**: Parse the provided start and finish times into `DateTime` objects to facilitate comparison.\n- **Step 3**: Sort the events based on their start time to easily detect overlapping events.\n- **Step 4**: Iterate through the sorted list of events and compare the finish time of the current event with the start time of the next event. If the finish time is greater than the next start time, return \"Conflict\".\n- **Step 5**: If no conflicts are detected, return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[255,411],"elapsed":4.923693208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-941567723,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
