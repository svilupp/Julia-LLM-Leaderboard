Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(e[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for e in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=e->e[1])\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `event_scheduler` function first checks if the list `events` is empty and returns \"No events\" if true.\n- Events are parsed from strings into `DateTime` objects using `DateTime(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`.\n- The events are then sorted based on their start times.\n- The function checks for overlaps by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next event. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\".\n- If no overlap is found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[144,254],"elapsed":3.168768958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":299324669,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
