Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import the `Dates` package** to handle datetime parsing and comparison.\n2. **Define the `event_scheduler` function** that accepts a list of event tuples. \n3. **Handle the case where the input list is empty** by returning \"No events\".\n4. **Parse the start and finish times of each event** using `DateTime` from the `Dates` package.\n5. **Sort events by starting time** to make it easier to check for overlaps.\n6. **Iterate through the sorted list** and compare finish time of the current event to the start time of the next event to detect overlaps.\n7. **Return appropriate results** based on the presence of conflicts.\n\nLet's write the code for this solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse events into DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n    \n    # Sort events based on start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:(length(parsed_events) - 1)\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), \n                          (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\nprintln(result)  # Expected Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n\n- The function first checks if the input list `events` is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\".\n- Event times are parsed into `DateTime` objects for easy comparison.\n- The list of events is sorted by start time.\n- A loop checks for overlaps by ensuring that each event's finish time is not after the next event's start time.\n- If an overlap is detected, \"Conflict\" is returned; otherwise, \"No conflicts\" is returned. \n\nThis solution accurately handles the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[255,490],"elapsed":5.664548417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1932962012,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
