Otherwise, it parses the start and finish times of each event into `DateTime` objects.

If no overlaps are detected, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[144,246],"elapsed":3.309125459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":805129035,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
