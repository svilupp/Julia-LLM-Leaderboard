Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then parses each eventâ€™s start and finish times into `DateTime` objects. The events are sorted by their start times to ease conflict detection. Finally, it iterates over the parsed events to check for any overlaps, returning \"Conflict\" if any are found. If no conflicts are detected, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[144,231],"elapsed":3.270490167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-543299463,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
