Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    n = length(events)\n    if n == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=e -> e[1])\n\n    for i in 1:(n - 1)\n        current_finish = sorted_events[i][2]\n        next_start = sorted_events[i + 1][1]\n        \n        if current_finish > next_start\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nMake sure to utilize the `Dates` package properly when using this function.
