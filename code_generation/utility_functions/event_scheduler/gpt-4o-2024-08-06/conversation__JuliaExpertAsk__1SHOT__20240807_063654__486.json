It then parses the string representations of date and time into `DateTime` objects. The events are sorted by start time, and the function iterates through them to check for overlaps. If any current event finish time is greater than the subsequent event's start time, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it concludes with \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[144,236],"elapsed":2.78723,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":438936840,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
