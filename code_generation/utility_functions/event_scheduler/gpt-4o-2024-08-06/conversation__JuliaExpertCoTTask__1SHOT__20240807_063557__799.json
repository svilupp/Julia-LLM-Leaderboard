If so, there's a conflict.\n\n4. **Return Result:**\n   - Return \"No conflicts\" if no conflicts are found, otherwise return \"Conflict\".\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n   - If the list of events is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nLet's implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # Should print \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n### Solution Verification\n\n- **Events are Parsed:** Using `DateTime` parsing.\n- **Sorting:** Events are sorted by start time.\n- **Conflict Detection:** Compare consecutive events for overlap.\n- **Edge Case Handling:** Empty list condition handled.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and correctly identifies scheduling conflicts among the list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[255,433],"elapsed":4.424703667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-881909442,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
