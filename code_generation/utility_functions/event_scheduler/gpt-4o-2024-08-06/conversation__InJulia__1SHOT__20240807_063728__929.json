We will iterate through the sorted list of events, comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event to check for any conflicts.\n\nHere's a function `event_scheduler` that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the event times into DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x->x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        current_finish = sorted_events[i][2]\n        next_start = sorted_events[i+1][1]\n        \n        if next_start < current_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-10-01 09:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 10:00\", \"2023-10-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-01 11:00\", \"2023-10-01 12:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **DateTime Parsing**: `DateTime(start)` and `DateTime(finish)` are used to convert the string representations of times into `DateTime` objects, which allow for easy comparison.\n- **Sorting**: The list of parsed events is sorted by the start time to ensure that we can simply compare adjacent events for conflicts.\n- **Conflict Checking**: We iterate through the sorted events, checking if the current event's finish time overlaps with the next event's start time. If a conflict is found, we immediately return \"Conflict\".\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - An empty list returns \"No events\".\n  - If no overlapping intervals are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[111,473],"elapsed":5.743372416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1913755590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
