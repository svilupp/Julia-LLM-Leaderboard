If the starting times are the same, sort based on the ending times.\n3. **Compare Consecutive Events**: Iterate through the sorted list and check if the finish time of any event overlaps with the start time of the following event. If the finish time of an event is greater than the start time of the next event, there's a scheduling conflict.\n4. **Result Formation**: If an overlap is found at any point, return \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are detected, return \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nNow, let's implement these steps in the `event_scheduler` function.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # Step 4: Return \"No events\" if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Step 1: Parse the input\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, Dates.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")), \n                      DateTime(finish, Dates.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))) for (start, finish) in events]\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort the events by start time, then finish time if start times are the same\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x -> (x[1], x[2]))\n    \n    # Step 3: Check for conflicts by comparing the finish time of one event with the start time of the next\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no conflict is found\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with examples below to verify correctness:\n\n```julia\n# Single event, no possible conflict\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\")]))  # -> No conflicts\n\n# Non-overlapping events\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # -> No conflicts\n\n# Overlapping events\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # -> Conflict\n\n# No events\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))  # -> No events\n```\n\nThe procedure and the function checks cover all possible scenarios with precise outputs as per requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[255,658],"elapsed":15.67338175,"cost":0.02229,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-599833495,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
