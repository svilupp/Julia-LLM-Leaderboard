Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

One event overlaps with another if it starts before the end of another event.\n    - Finish checking when either a conflict is found or none exists after parsing all events.\n    - Return the appropriate string based on the result (\"No conflicts\", \"Conflict\").\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n    - Define the function `event_scheduler` that accepts a list of tuples indicating event times.\n    - Utilize the `Dates` module for parsing date and time.\n    - Write conditional logic to handle potential overlaps.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n    - Sort events by start time.\n    - Check for overlaps using the sorted list.\n    - Return \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found; otherwise, \"No conflicts\".\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n    - Test the function using provided examples as well as additional test cases, including edge cases like consecutive events, overlapping by a minute, and no events.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if there are no events\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse and sort events by start time\n    parsed_events = map(events) do event\n        (DateTime(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    end\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    last_end_time = parsed_events[1][2]\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] < last_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        last_end_time = max(last_end_time, parsed_events[i][2])\n    end\n\n    # If no conflicts found\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExamples:\nTo validate this function, provide different scenarios and check its outputs.\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])) # \"No conflicts\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])) # \"Conflict\"\nprintln(event_scheduler([])) # \"No events\"\n```\n\nThis would execute correctly in a Julia environment with the Dates module.","status":200,"tokens":[255,617],"elapsed":13.254066917,"cost":0.021060000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1722092858,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
