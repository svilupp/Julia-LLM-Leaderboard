An event is a tuple with starting and finishing times.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n    - Parse the start and finish times of each event using the Dates package.\n    - Sort the list of events by the start time.\n    - Check each consecutive event pair to see if the finish time of the earlier event overlaps with the start time of the following event.\n    - Return the appropriate message based on the findings.\n\n3. **Function Implementation**:\n    - Use the `DateTime` function from the `Dates` module to convert time strings into DateTime objects.\n    - For sorting, use the `sort` function based on the start time.\n    - Implement the conflict checking logic as described.\n\n4. **Validation**:\n    - Ensure that the function correctly identifies cases with no events, no conflicts, and conflicts.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse event times into DateTime format\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    \n    # Sort events based on the start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        current_finish = parsed_events[i][2]\n        next_start = parsed_events[i+1][1]\n        if current_finish > next_start\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) # Expected Output: \"No conflicts\"\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) # Expected Output: \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nThis function should correctly handle the scenarios described in the task and perform the required conflict detection.","status":200,"tokens":[255,509],"elapsed":13.7021785,"cost":0.017820000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":840823267,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
