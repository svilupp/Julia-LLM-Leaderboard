Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Each event duration is given as a tuple containing start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. We need to check for any cases where the intervals might intersect, indicating a scheduling conflict.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Parse the event start and end times using the `Dates` package in Julia.\n2. Sort the events based on the start time. This makes it easier to check for overlapping intervals sequentially.\n3. Check for overlaps:\n   - If the start time of one event is earlier than the end time of the previous event, there's a conflict.\n4. Return \"Conflict\" if any overlap is detected; otherwise return \"No conflicts\".\n5. If the input list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\n## Julia Code Implementation\n\nWe'll apply the steps outlined above in the `event_scheduler` function.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse the dates and sort events by start time\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"), DateTime(finish, dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for overlaps\n    prev_end = parsed_events[1][2]\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        current_start, current_end = parsed_events[i]\n        \n        if current_start < prev_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        prev_end = current_end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nIn this solution, we made use of date and time parsing, tuple comprehension for transforming and sorting the events, and a simple loop to detect conflicts between consecutive events in the sorted list.","status":200,"tokens":[255,445],"elapsed":13.2207035,"cost":0.0159,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2115490794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
