Checking if the list is empty and immediately returning \"No events\" if true.\n2. Parsing the start and end times of each event from String format to DateTime using the `Dates` package.\n3. Sorting the events by both start and end times to ensure the sequence.\n4. Checking for overlaps by comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event.\n5. Returning \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found, or \"No conflicts\" if all events are non-overlapping.","status":200,"tokens":[146,326],"elapsed":7.566944417,"cost":0.01124,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-274304303,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
