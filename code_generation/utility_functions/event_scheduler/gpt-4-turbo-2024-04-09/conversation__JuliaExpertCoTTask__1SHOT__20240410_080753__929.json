This simplifies the checking process to only comparing consecutive events for overlap.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**: Iterate through the sorted list of events and check if the end time of the current event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event.\n\n5. **Return Corresponding Messages**: Depending on the findings, if any overlap is detected, return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts and some events exist, return \"No conflicts\".
