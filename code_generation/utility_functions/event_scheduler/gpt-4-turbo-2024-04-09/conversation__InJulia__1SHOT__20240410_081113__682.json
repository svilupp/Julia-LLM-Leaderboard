The function first checks if the events list is empty. If so, it returns `\"No events\"`.\n2. It then parses the start and finish times of each event from the string tuple into `DateTime` objects using Julia's `Dates` package.\n3. These parsed dates are stored in a list of tuples and sorted by start time.\n4. The function then iterates through the sorted list, comparing the end time of each event to the start time of the next event to check for overlaps.\n5. If any overlap is found, it immediately returns `\"Conflict\"`.\n6. If no overlaps are found after checking all events, it concludes with `\"No conflicts\"`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the date-time format always matches `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'` as specified and that the input tuples are valid according to this format.","status":200,"tokens":[111,581],"elapsed":12.866367833,"cost":0.01854,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1058539659,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
