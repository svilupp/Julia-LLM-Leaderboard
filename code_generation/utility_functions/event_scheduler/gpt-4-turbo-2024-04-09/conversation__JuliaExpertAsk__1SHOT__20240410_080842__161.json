If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\". It then processes the list of events, parsing the date-time strings and creating a list of tuples. These tuples are sorted based on the start time of each event using the `sort!` function, to make it easier to check for overlaps. Next, the function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the last event. If so, there's a conflict, and it returns \"Conflict\". If it finishes checking all events without finding any overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,324],"elapsed":6.842496542,"cost":0.011179999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":682056122,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
