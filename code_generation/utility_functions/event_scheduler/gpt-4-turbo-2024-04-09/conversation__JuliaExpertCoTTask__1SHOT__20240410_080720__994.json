Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Solution Approach\n\n1. **Preparation**: \n   Use Julia's `Dates` module to convert the events' start and finish time strings into `DateTime` objects which will allow for accurate time comparison.\n\n2. **Sorting**:\n   Firstly, sort the list of events primarily by start time and, in cases where start times are the same, by end time. This simplifies the process of determining if there is any overlap.\n\n3. **Checking for Overlaps**:\n   Iterate through the sorted list of events: \n   - For each event, check if its start time is before the finish time of the previous event (in the sorted list). If that's the case, we have an overlap i.e., a conflict.\n\n4. **Returning the Result**:\n   - If the list of events is empty, return \"No events\".\n   - If any overlap is found, return \"Conflict\".\n   - If no overlap is found during the checks, return \"No conflicts\".\n\n**Note**:\nOverlap logic is based on strict inequality of times. If `end_time` of event `A` is exactly equal to `start_time` of event `B`, then they do not overlap.\n\nLet's proceed to implement the `event_scheduler` function based on the mentioned approach.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # Checking if the event list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parsing the dates and sorting the events based on their start times and where necessary end times\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x -> (x[1], x[2]))\n    \n    # Checking for conflicts based on sorted order\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] < parsed_events[i-1][2]  # if current event's start is before last event's finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Examples\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\")]))\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[255,568],"elapsed":12.556509917,"cost":0.01959,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":580238633,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
