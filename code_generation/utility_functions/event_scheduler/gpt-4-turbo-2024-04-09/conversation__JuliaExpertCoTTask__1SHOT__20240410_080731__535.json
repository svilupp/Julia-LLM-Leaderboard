Parse each event's start and finish time from string to datetime format using Julia's `Dates` package.\n2. Sort the events based on their start times.\n3. Compare each event's start time to the previous event's finish time to check for overlaps:\n   - If an event starts before the previous event finishes, mark it as a conflict.\n4. Return \"Conflict\" if any overlap is found during comparison, otherwise \"No conflicts\".\n5. If the events list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nLet's code this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Convert event time strings to DateTime objects and sort events by start time\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(e[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(e[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for e in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts by comparing each event's start time with the last event's end time\n    last_end_time = parsed_events[1][2]\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] < last_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        last_end_time = parsed_events[i][2]\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test cases\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))  # No conflicts\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:30\")]))  # Conflict\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))  # No events\n```\nThis code first converts the event time intervals from string format to `DateTime` objects. After sorting the events by starting time, it iteratively checks for conflicts by comparing start and end times of consecutive events, responding appropriately based on whether it finds overlaps or not.","status":200,"tokens":[255,488],"elapsed":10.856365333,"cost":0.01719,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":207075589,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
