Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nTo solve this task:\n\n1. Parse the date-time strings to create DateTime objects using the Dates package in Julia.\n2. If the event list is empty, directly return \"No events\".\n3. Sort the list of events based on the start time.\n4. Check for any overlap by comparing the end time of one event to the start time of the successive event.\n5. If any event's end time is greater than or equal to the next event's start time, return \"Conflict\".\n6.
