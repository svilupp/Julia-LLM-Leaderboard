If this is not the case for any pair of events, then there is an overlap and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no such pair is found, then there are no overlaps and the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[122,372],"elapsed":14.751523625,"cost":0.00012124000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":893079543,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
