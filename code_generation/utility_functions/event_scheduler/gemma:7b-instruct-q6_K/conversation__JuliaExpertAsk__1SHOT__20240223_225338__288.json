Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nevent_scheduler(events) = begin\n  if events == []\n    return \"No events\"\n  end\n\n  events_parsed = parse(DateTime, events)\n  conflicts = Dates.overlaps(events_parsed)\n\n  if conflicts\n    return \"Conflict\"\n  else\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events `events` as input.\n* It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n* It then parses the list of events into `DateTime` objects using the `parse` function and the `Dates` package.\n* The function uses the `Dates.overlaps` function to check for any overlapping events.\n* If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-04-01 10:00\", \"2023-04-01 12:00\"), (\"2023-04-01 11:00\", \"2023-04-01 13:00\")]\n\nevent_scheduler(events)  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n\nevents = []\n\nevent_scheduler(events)  # Output: \"No events\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[137,317],"elapsed":21.676685792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":17858,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
