Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n  if isempty(events)\n    return \"No events\"\n  end\n\n  # Parse event times\n  events_parsed = parse(DateTime, events)\n\n  # Check for conflicts\n  conflicts = any(overlaps(events_parsed[1], events_parsed[2:end]))\n\n  # Return \"No conflicts\" if there are no conflicts\n  if not conflicts\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n  end\n\n  # Return \"Conflict\" if there are any conflicts\n  return \"Conflict\"\nend\n\n# Data\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\n\nevent_scheduler(events)  # Output: No conflicts\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events as input.\n* It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is.\n* It then parses the event times using the `parse` function and the `Dates` package.\n* It checks for conflicts using the `overlaps` function.\n* If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n* If there are conflicts, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `Dates` package is used for parsing and manipulating date and time values.\n* The `overlaps` function checks whether two date ranges overlap.\n* The `events_parsed` list contains parsed DateTime objects for each event.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":25.202717709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-9785,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
