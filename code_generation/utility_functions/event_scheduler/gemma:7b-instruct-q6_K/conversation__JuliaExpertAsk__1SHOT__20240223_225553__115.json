Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nimport Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if events == []\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events_parsed = parse(Dates.DateTime, events)\n\n    conflicts = Dates.overlaps(events_parsed)\n\n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events `events` as input.\n* If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n* The function parses the event times using `parse(Dates.DateTime, events)` and stores them in `events_parsed`.\n* It uses the `Dates.overlaps` function to check for any overlapping events.\n* If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n* Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 11:00\", \"2023-01-01 13:00\")]\n\nevent_scheduler(events)  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n\nevents = []\n\nevent_scheduler(events)  # Output: \"No events\"\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `Dates` package is required for this function to work.\n* The event times must be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n* The function does not handle time zones.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":23.801006583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":30812,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
