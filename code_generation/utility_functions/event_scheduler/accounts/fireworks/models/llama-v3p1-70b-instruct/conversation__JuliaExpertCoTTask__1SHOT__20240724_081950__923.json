If so, it returns \"No events\".\n2.  **Sort Events**: It sorts the events in ascending order based on their start times.\n3.  **Initialize Previous End Time**: The function sets the `prev_end` variable to the end time of the first event.\n4.  **Iterate Through Events**: It iterates through the events, starting from the second event (since we've already handled the first event).\n5.  **Check for Conflicts**: For each event, it checks if the start time is before the `prev_end` time. If so, it means there's a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n6.  **Update Previous End Time**: If no conflict is found, it updates the `prev_end` time to the end time of the current event.\n7.  **Return No Conflicts**: If the function completes the iteration without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[258,513],"elapsed":5.38929775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2032941866,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
