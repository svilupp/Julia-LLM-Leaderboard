Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This function will first check if the list is empty and return \"No events\" in that case. Then, it will iterate over the list of events, checking if any of the events overlap.

If no overlaps are found, the function will return \"No conflicts\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Iterate over the list of events\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start_time_current = DateTime(events[i][1], \"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time_current = DateTime(events[i][2], \"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        start_time_next = DateTime(events[i+1][1], \"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time_next = DateTime(events[i+1][2], \"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        \n        # Check for overlap\n        if start_time_current < finish_time_next && start_time_next < finish_time_current\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no overlaps are found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n# Output: No conflicts\n\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:30\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:00\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n# Output: Conflict\n\nprintln(event_scheduler([]))\n# Output: No events\n```\n\nThis solution correctly checks for overlapping events and returns the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[258,418],"elapsed":3.213959583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1530177886,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
