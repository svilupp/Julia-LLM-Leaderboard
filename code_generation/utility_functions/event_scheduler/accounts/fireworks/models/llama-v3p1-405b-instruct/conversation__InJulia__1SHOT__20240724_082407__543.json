The function first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\". If the list is not empty, the function sorts the events by start time and then iterates through them, checking if the current event's start time is less than the previous event's end time (indicating a conflict). If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If the function iterates through all events without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[114,519],"elapsed":21.257645958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":70999068,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
