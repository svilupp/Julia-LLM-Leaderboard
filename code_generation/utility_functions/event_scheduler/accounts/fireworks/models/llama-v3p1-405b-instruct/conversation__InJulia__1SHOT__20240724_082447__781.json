Each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. If any events overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". The code uses Julia's `Dates` package to parse the event times and compare them.","status":200,"tokens":[114,564],"elapsed":18.080652291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-407410549,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
