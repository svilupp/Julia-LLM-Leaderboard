Then we sort the events by start time. After that, we initialize the `last_end_time` variable with the end time of the first event. We iterate over the rest of the events, and for each one, we check if its start time is earlier than the last end time. If so, it means there's a scheduling conflict, so we return \"Conflict\". If we get through all the events without finding a conflict, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[114,438],"elapsed":14.767415958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1697310751,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
