[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The code begins by importing the `Dates` package to handle date and time functionality.\n2.  The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events, where each event is a tuple of start and finish times.\n3.  The events are sorted based on their start times using `sort!` function and `by` keyword.\n4.  Then it iterates over the sorted events, comparing the finish time of the current event to the start time of the next event.\n5.  If the start time of the next event is before the finish time of the current event, that indicates an overlap, so it returns \"Conflict\".\n6.  If no overlap is found, it checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events.\" Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[114,527],"elapsed":20.817288125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1221285160,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
