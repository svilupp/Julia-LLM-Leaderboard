This function takes a list of events as input, where each event is a tuple with a start and end time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, returns \"No events\". If the list is not empty, the function iterates through all pairs of events and checks if there is any overlap in their start and end times. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlaps, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\n```\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start1, end1 = parse.(Date, events[i])\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            start2, end2 = parse.(Date, events[j])\n            if start1 <","status":200,"tokens":[113,200],"elapsed":3.832463042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1348384855,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
