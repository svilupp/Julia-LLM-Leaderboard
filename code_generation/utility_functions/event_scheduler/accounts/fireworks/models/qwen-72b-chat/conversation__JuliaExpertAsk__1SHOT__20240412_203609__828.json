Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Date(x[1]))\n    conflicting = false\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if Date(sorted_events[i][1]) < Date(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            conflicting = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflicting ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks if the input list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is.
