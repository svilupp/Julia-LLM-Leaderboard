Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that implements the required `event_scheduler` function:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = e -> Date(e[1], e[2]))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time = Date(sorted_events[i-1][2], sorted_events[i-1][3])\n        finish_time = Date(sorted_events[i][2], sorted_events[i][3])\n\n        if finish_time >= start_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis code sorts the events list by their start times and compares adjacent events to check for any overlaps.
