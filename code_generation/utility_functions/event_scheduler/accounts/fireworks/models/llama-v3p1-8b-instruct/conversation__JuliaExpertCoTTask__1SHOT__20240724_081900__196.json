Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort events by start time\n    events = sort(events; by=x->parse(DateTime,x[1]))\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        if parse(DateTime,events[i-1][2]) > parse(DateTime,events[i][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   We define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input.\n*   We first check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n*   We then sort the events by their start time using the `sort` function from the standard library and a custom comparison function that parses each event's start time as a `DateTime`.\n*   We then iterate over the sorted list of events, starting from the second event (index 2). For each event, we check if the end time of the previous event is later than the start time of the current event. If we find a pair of events that overlap, we return \"Conflict\".\n*   If we finish checking all pairs of events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[258,325],"elapsed":1.163842792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":11217210,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
