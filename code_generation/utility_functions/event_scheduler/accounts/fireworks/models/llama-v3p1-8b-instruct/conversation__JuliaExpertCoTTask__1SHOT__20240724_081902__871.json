Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

An event is a tuple with a start and a finish time. We need to determine if any events overlap in time.\n\n## Step 2: Define the approach\nTo solve this problem, we can sort the list of events by their start times. Then, we can iterate through the sorted list and check if any event starts before the previous event finishes. If we find any overlap, we can immediately return \"Conflict\". If we get to the end of the list without finding any conflicts, we can return \"No conflicts\".\n\n## Step 3: Write the function and use a package to parse times\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    sorted_events = sort(events; by=x->Date(x[1]))\n\n    # Initialize the previous event finish time to negative infinity\n    prev_finish = -Inf\n\n    # Iterate through the sorted list of events\n    for event in sorted_events\n        # Check if the current event starts before the previous event finishes\n        if Date(event[1]) < prev_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        # Update the previous event finish time\n        prev_finish = Date(event[2])\n    end\n\n    # If we get to the end of the list without finding any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis function will first check if the list of events is empty.

If it gets to the end of the list without finding any conflicts, it will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[258,489],"elapsed":1.684290458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-984089454,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
