We first check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n2. We sort the list of events by their start times. This makes it easier to check for overlapping events.\n3. Then we iterate through the sorted list of events. For each event, we check if it overlaps with any of the following events in the list.\n4. We use the `parse` function from the Dates package to convert the event start and finish times from strings to DateTime objects, which we can then compare for overlap.\n5. If we find any overlapping events, we immediately return \"Conflict\".\n6. If we finish checking all events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere is an example use case:\n\n```julia\n# Define a list of events\nevents = [\n    (\"2024-01-01 10:00\", \"2024-01-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2024-01-01 11:00\", \"2024-01-01 13:00\"),\n    (\"2024-01-01 12:00\", \"2024-01-01 14:00\")\n]\n\n# Check for conflicts\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: \"Conflict\"\n\nevents = [\n    (\"2024-01-01 10:00\", \"2024-01-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2024-01-02 11:00\", \"2024-01-02 13:00\")\n]\n\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[114,533],"elapsed":1.817214458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-346608439,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
