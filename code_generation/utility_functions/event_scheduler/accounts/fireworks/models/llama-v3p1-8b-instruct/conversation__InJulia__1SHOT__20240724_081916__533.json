If not, it sorts the events by their start times and then checks each event to see if it overlaps with the previous one. If any conflicts are found, it immediately returns \"Conflict.\" If no conflicts are found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts.\" The function also returns \"No events\" when the input list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[114,461],"elapsed":1.579922209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":309338080,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
