[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Here's an example of how you could define the `event_scheduler` function:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list of events is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sort!(events, by = first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        if events[i-1][2] > events[i][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If no conflicts were found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events by start time using the `sort!` function with the `by` keyword argument set to `first","status":200,"tokens":[113,200],"elapsed":4.891215917,"cost":0.0005008,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":201431844,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
