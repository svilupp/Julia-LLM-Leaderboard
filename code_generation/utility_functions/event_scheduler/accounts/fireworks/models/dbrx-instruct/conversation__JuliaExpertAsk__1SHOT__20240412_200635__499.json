Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n    sort!(events, by=first)\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        start, finish = events[i]\n        prev_start, prev_finish = events[i-1]\n        if start < prev_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events by their start time. After that, it iterates through the list of events and checks if the start time of the current event is less than the finish time of the previous event. If it is, it returns \"Conflict\". If it goes through the entire list without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[148,179],"elapsed":3.872763,"cost":0.0005231999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1692150935,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
