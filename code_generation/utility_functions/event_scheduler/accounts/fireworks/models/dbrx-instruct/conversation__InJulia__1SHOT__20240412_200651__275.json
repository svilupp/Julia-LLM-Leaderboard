Here's an example of how you might implement the `event_scheduler` function using the Dates package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}, 1})\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sort!(events, by=x->x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        if events[i][2] > events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function takes an array of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a start and finish time as a `DateTime` object. It first sorts the events by start time, then checks for conflicts by looking at the end time of each event and the start time of the next event.
