[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then it iterates over the events, checking if the current event overlaps with the last event. If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it iterates over all events without finding any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[115,527],"elapsed":8.135485875,"cost":0.008480000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":399469112,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
