Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n@show event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis solution first checks if the event list is empty and returns \"No events\" if so. It then sorts the events based on their start times. After sorting, it checks each event's start time with the end time of the previous event. If any event's start time is earlier than the end time of the previous event, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[304,298],"elapsed":2.128217042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-483522327,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
