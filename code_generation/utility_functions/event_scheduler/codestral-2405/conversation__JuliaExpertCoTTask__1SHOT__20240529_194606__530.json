Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, it returns \"No events\". If not, it sorts the events by their start times. Then, it iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if any event starts before the previous event ends. If it does, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[304,289],"elapsed":2.083005542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-601013677,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
