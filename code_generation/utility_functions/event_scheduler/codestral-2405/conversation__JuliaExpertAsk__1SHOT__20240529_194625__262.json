Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n\n    sort!(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        if DateTime(events[i][2]) > DateTime(events[i+1][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the event list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events by the start time. It then iterates through the sorted events and checks if the end time of one event is greater than the start time of the next event. If such a case is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no such case is found, it returns \"No conflicts\". This function assumes that the input list is in the correct format and does not contain any invalid dates.","status":200,"tokens":[157,217],"elapsed":1.564699291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-986667842,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
