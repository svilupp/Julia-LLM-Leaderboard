The task is to create a function, `event_scheduler`, that checks for any overlapping events and returns either \"No conflicts\", \"Conflict\", or \"No events\" depending on the input.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution in Julia:\n\n1. Define the function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input.\n2. Use the `Dates` package to parse the start and end times of the events.\n3. Loop through the list of events and check for any overlaps.\n4. If there are no overlaps, return \"No conflicts\".\n5. If any overlaps are found, return \"Conflict\".\n6.
