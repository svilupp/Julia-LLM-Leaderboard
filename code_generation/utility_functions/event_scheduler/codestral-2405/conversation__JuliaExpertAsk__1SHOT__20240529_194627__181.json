Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then parses the start and finish times of each event into `DateTime` objects and sorts the list of events by start time. It then iterates through the list of events and checks if the finish time of the current event is after the start time of the next event. If it is, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[157,247],"elapsed":1.766850667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1232361715,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
