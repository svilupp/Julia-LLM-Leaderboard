If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events based on the start time. After that, it iterates through the sorted list of events, comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next event. If it finds any overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlap after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[157,224],"elapsed":1.601469542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1733719953,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
