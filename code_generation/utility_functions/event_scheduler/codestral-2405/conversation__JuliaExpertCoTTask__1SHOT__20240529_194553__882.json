If the list is empty, it immediately returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events by the start time and checks for any overlaps by comparing the end time of an event with the start time of the next event. If it finds any overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it completes the list without finding any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". The script then tests the function with a list of events.","status":200,"tokens":[304,323],"elapsed":2.323258,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1101182234,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
