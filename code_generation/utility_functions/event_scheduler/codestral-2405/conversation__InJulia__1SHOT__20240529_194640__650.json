[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it is, we return \"No events\".\n\nThen, we sort the events based on their start times.\n\nAfter that, we iterate over the sorted events. For each event, we compare its start time with the end time of the previous event. If the start time is earlier than the end time of the previous event, we return \"Conflict\" because there is an overlap.\n\nIf we finish iterating over all events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,268],"elapsed":1.932946333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1141636379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
