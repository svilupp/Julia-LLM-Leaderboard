[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, the function parses the event times using the Dates package and sorts the events by start time. Finally, the function checks for any schedule conflicts by iterating through the sorted list of events and checking if the start time of the current event is before the finish time of the previous event. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[423,529],"elapsed":3.803107417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1976823000,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
