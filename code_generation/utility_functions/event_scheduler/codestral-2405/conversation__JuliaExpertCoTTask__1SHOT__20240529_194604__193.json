If it is, we return \"No events\". Then, we sort the events based on the start time. After that, we iterate over the sorted events and check if the end time of the current event is later than the start time of the next event. If it is, we return \"Conflict\". If we have checked all events and found no conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[304,219],"elapsed":1.596472,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":75908070,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
