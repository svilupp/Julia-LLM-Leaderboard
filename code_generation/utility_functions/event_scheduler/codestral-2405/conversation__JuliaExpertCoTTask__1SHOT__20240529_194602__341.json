Then, we sort the events by start time. After that, we iterate through the sorted list and check if the end time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event. If this is the case, we have a conflict and return \"Conflict\". If we finish iterating through the list without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, we return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[304,389],"elapsed":2.76469325,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":833964355,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
