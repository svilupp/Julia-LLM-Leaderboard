Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Define a function, `event_scheduler`, that takes a list of events as an argument.\n2.

If the start time of an event is less than or equal to the finish time of the previous event, I will return \"Conflict\".\n4. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, I will return \"No conflicts\".\n5.
