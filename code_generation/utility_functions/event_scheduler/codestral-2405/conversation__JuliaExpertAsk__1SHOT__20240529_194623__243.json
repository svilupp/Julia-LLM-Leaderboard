Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n    last_end = DateTime(sorted_events[1][2])\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < last_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        last_end = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2])\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the event list is empty. If it is, \"No events\" is returned. If not, the list is sorted based on the start times of the events. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, comparing each event's start time with the end time of the previous event. If a conflict is found, \"Conflict\" is returned. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[157,247],"elapsed":5.631668042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1627983725,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
