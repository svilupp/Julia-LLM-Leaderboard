Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n    sort!(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n    for i in 1:size(events, 1) - 1\n        if parse(DateTime, events[i][2]) > parse(DateTime, events[i+1][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events as input. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". It sorts the events based on the start time and then iterates through the list to check for any overlapping events. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". It uses the Dates package for parsing the date and time strings.","status":200,"tokens":[157,212],"elapsed":1.52856375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-205375974,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
