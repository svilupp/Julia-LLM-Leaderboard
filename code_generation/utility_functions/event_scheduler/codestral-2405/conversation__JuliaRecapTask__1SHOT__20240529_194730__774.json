X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets:\n   - I'll use the Dates package to parse and compare the time stamps.\n   - I'll iterate over the given list of events using a for loop.\n   - I'll use conditional statements to check for overlapping events.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n   - I'll define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input.\n   - Inside the function, I'll sort the events based on their start times.\n   - Then, I'll iterate over the sorted list of events.\n   - For each event, I'll check if its start time is less than or equal to the finish time of the previous event.\n   - If the condition is true, I'll return \"Conflict\" since there is an overlap.\n   - If the loop completes without finding any overlapping events, I'll return \"No conflicts\".\n   - If the input list is empty, I'll return \"No events\".\n\n3.
