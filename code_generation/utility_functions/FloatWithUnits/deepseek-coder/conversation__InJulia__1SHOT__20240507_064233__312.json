Here's how you can define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `Base.show` is the function that Julia calls to display an object. The first argument is an IO object (`io`) that you write to to display the object. The second argument is the object itself (`f`).\n\nYou can use this struct and the `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, the `show` method is called automatically by Julia when you try to display the `FloatWithUnits` object. It writes the value and unit to the IO object, which is then displayed.","status":200,"tokens":[74,261],"elapsed":13.277078208,"cost":8.344e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":38892986,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
