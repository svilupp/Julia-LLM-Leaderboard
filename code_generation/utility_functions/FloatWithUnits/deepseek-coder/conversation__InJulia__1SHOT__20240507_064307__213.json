Here is how you can define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `Base.show` is the built-in Julia function that Julia calls to display an object. The `io::IO` argument is a stream where the object should be displayed, and `x::FloatWithUnits` is the object to be displayed. The `print` function is used to write the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object to the stream.\n\nYou can use this struct and show method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FloatWithUnits` object `x` is displayed as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[74,295],"elapsed":11.135323917,"cost":9.296e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-773584619,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
