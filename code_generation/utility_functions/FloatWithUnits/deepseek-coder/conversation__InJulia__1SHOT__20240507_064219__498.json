Here is how you can define a `show` method for a struct `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `Base.show` is the function that Julia calls to display an object. The first argument is an IO object where the output should be written, and the second argument is the object to be displayed.\n\nYou can use this struct and the `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `show` method has concatenated the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[74,228],"elapsed":12.323740208,"cost":7.42e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1324088604,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
