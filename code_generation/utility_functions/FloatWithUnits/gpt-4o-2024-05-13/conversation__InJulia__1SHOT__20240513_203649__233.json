First, you need to define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields. Then, you can define a custom `show` method to control how instances of this struct are printed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n2. Implement the custom `show` method.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement the custom show method\nimport Base.show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(example)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct and customizes how objects of this type are displayed using the `show` method. The `println(example)` statement will output:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that whenever you print a `FloatWithUnits` object, it will show the value and unit concatenated with a space as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[70,245],"elapsed":2.451889917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1894887466,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
