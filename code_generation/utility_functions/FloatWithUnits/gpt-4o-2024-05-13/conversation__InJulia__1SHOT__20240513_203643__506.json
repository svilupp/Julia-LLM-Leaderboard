First, you'll need to define the `FloatWithUnits` struct in Julia, and then you can define a custom `show` method for it. Below is the complete code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. The `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined with two fields:\n    - `value` of type `Float64`\n    - `unit` of type `String`\n\n2. The `Base.show` method is overridden to customize the display of `FloatWithUnits` instances. The `show` method takes two arguments:\n    - `io`: the I/O stream to which the output should be written\n    - `fwu`: an instance of `FloatWithUnits`\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, the `print` function is used to write the formatted string to the I/O stream, concatenating the `value` and `unit` with a space in between.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nWith this setup, when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[70,314],"elapsed":3.052060542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":444952647,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
