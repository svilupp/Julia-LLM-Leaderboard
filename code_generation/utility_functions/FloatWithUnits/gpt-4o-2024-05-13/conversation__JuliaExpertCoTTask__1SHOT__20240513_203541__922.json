Run the code in a Julia environment.\n2. Confirm the output is \"1.8 meters\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe task is accomplished with the provided struct and `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[174,357],"elapsed":3.900363333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1703711455,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
