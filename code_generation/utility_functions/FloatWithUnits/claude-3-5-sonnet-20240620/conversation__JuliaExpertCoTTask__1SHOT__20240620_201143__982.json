Let's go through the problem-solving steps to create the `FloatWithUnits` struct and implement the `show` method.\n\n1.

Implement the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nimport Base: show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Test the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Test the show method\nprintln(example)\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly display the `FloatWithUnits` object as \"1.8 meters\" when printed.","status":200,"tokens":[183,210],"elapsed":3.356157167,"cost":0.003699,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25430,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
