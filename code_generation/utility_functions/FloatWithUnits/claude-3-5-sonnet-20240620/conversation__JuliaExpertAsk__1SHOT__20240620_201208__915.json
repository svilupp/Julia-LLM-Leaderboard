Here's a concise implementation of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its corresponding `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nimport Base: show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct and overloads the `show` function from `Base`. The `show` method concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them, as requested.\n\nYou can test it like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> fw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fw)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will output the `FloatWithUnits` object in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[108,220],"elapsed":3.404209417,"cost":0.003624,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9962,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
