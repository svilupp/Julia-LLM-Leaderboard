Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n3. Test the implementation with the provided data.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the custom show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ndata = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(data)  # This should output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThis code defines a struct `FloatWithUnits` and a corresponding `show` method that formats the output as specified. We then create an instance of this struct with the given data to verify its output.","status":200,"tokens":[174,204],"elapsed":2.424710791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1279106670,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
