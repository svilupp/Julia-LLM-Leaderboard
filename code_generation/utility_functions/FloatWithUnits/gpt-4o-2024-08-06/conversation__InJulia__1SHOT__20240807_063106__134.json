The method uses `print` to write to the provided `IO` stream (which is often the console) the `value` and `unit` separated by a space.\n- **Example Usage**: The example creates an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and prints it, resulting in the output \"1.8 meters\" as specified.\n\nThis custom `show` method ensures that when you display a `FloatWithUnits` object using `println`, `print`, or any other function that relies on `show`, it will use your custom format.","status":200,"tokens":[70,343],"elapsed":3.600054792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1414608531,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
