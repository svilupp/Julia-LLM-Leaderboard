Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. Implement a custom `show` method that formats the output to concatenate the `value` and `unit` with a space in between.\n\nLet's implement it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # It should output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined to hold a `value` and a `unit`.\n- The `show` function is overridden for `FloatWithUnits` to print the desired output format.\n- The `println` function is used to exercise the `show` method, confirming that the implementation works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[174,237],"elapsed":2.810686375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1863061057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
