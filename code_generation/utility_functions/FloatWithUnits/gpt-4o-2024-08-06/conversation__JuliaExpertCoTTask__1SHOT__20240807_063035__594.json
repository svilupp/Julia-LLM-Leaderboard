Define a struct named `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement a custom `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` that formats the output as a string with the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Custom show method for the REPL output\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fw::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fw.value) $(fw.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Initialize a FloatWithUnits instance\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Check the output\nprintln(example)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `FloatWithUnits` is defined with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n- The `show` method is overridden. It uses formatted printing to concatenate the `value` and `unit`, separated by a space.\n- An instance of `FloatWithUnits` is created with a sample value and unit, and the output is checked using `println`. The expected output should be \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[174,261],"elapsed":2.918514166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1912876583,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
