The `show` method is overridden to ensure that when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed, it will display the value followed by a space and the unit. This method modifies how the object is represented when using `print` or `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[70,218],"elapsed":2.657374209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-916259544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
