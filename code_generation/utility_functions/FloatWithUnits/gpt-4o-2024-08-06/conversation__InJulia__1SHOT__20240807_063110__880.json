After defining the struct, you can implement a custom `show` method to format the output as desired. Below is the complete implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the custom show method for the FloatWithUnits struct\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, obj.value, \" \", obj.unit)\nend\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n- `struct FloatWithUnits`: This defines a new composite data type called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`).\n- `function Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)`: This is a method definition that overrides the default `show` behavior for `FloatWithUnits`. It makes use of Julia's multiple dispatch by specifying the type of `obj` as `FloatWithUnits`.\n- `print(io, obj.value, \" \", obj.unit)`: This line formats the output by printing the `value` followed by a space and then the `unit`.\n\nTo see this in action, you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(example)  # Output will be: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will display the desired format in the console output.","status":200,"tokens":[70,337],"elapsed":3.944016583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1407361249,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
