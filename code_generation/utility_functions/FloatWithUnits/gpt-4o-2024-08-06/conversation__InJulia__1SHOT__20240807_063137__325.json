In Julia, you can define a `struct` to represent a value with a unit, and then implement a custom `show` method to control its display. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement the custom `show` method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and when you display them using `print` or in the REPL, they will show in the desired format.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\ndistance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Print it to see the custom format\nprintln(distance)  # Output will be: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis approach effectively overrides the default printing behavior for the `FloatWithUnits` type by customizing the `show` method that Julia uses to render objects as strings.","status":200,"tokens":[70,240],"elapsed":3.314674625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2081706757,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
