[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

It formats the output by printing the `value` followed by a space and then the `unit`.\n- **Example Usage**: We demonstrate by creating a `FloatWithUnits` object, which when printed shows the formatted `value` and `unit`. \n\nThe solution is correct and displays the float value concatenated with its unit as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[174,244],"elapsed":2.979724541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":408528634,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
