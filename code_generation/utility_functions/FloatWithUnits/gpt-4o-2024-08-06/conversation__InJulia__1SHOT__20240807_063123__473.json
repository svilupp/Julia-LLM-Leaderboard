This method takes two parameters:\n   - `io::IO`: Represents where the output is going (e.g., the console).\n   - `obj::FloatWithUnits`: Represents the instance of our struct.\n\n   Within the `show` method, we combine the `value` and `unit` with a space in between using string interpolation and `print` it to the given IO stream.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw)  # Output will be: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that whenever you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it shows in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[70,339],"elapsed":4.3983195,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":922951237,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
