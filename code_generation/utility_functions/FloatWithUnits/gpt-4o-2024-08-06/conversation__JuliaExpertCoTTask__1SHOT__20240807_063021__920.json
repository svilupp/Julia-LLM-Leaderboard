We'll then implement a custom `show` method for this struct to display the `value` and `unit` together with a space in between.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` to format the output as specified.\n\nHere's how the implementation will look:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example instance of the FloatWithUnits\ndata = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display the example\nprintln(data)\n```\n\nThis code will output: `1.8 meters` as expected based on the task requirements. \n\nBy implementing the `Base.show` method, any instance of `FloatWithUnits` will be displayed in the desired format when printed.","status":200,"tokens":[174,257],"elapsed":3.030452917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":241129335,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
