Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct with two fields: value and unit\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Overload the show method for the struct\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\ndisplay(float_with_units)  # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nIn the `show` method, `io` is an `IO` object that represents the output stream where the text will be printed. The `print` function is used to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, as specified in your request.\n\nWhen you call `display(float_with_units)`, it will invoke the custom `show` method you've defined, and you'll see the output \"1.8 meters\". If you just type the variable name `float_with_units` in the REPL or in a script without calling `display`, Julia will also use the `show` method to determine how to display the object.","status":200,"tokens":[72,318],"elapsed":63.085098333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1585458846,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
