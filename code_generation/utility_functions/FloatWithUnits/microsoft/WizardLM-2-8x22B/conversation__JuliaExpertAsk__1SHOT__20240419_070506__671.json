We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for our struct. The `show` method is used by Julia to display objects of user-defined types. The method takes two arguments: `io`, which is an `IO` object representing the output stream, and `f`, which is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write the `value` and `unit` of the `FloatWithUnits` instance to the `io` stream, separated by a space.\n\nWith this custom `show` method, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, Julia will use this method to print the `value` and `unit` concatenated with a space.\n\nHere's an example of how you would use the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\nmy_length = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display the instance\nmy_length  # This will print \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[114,400],"elapsed":71.013519041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":2042180173,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
