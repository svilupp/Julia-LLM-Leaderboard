In this case, I defined that to concatenate the value and unit fields of our FloatWithUnits struct with a space. The `string` function was used to convert the numeric value into a string so it can be printed out together with the units.","status":200,"tokens":[197,222],"elapsed":69.077994583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
