The `::FloatWithUnits` part is type annotation, telling Julia what type `x` should be.\n4. **`return string(x.value) . \" \" . x.unit`:**\n   - `x.value`: Accesses the `value` field of the struct `x`.\n   - `string(x.value)`: Converts the `value` to a string.\n   - ` . \" \" .`: Concatenates the string representation of the value with a space and then the `unit` field.\n   - `return`: The concatenated string is returned as the output of the `show` function.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. Save this code as a `.jl` file (e.g., `units.jl`).\n\n2. In your Julia REPL or script, require the file:\n\n   ```julia\n   using units\n   ```\n\n3. Create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n   ```julia\n   my_length = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n   ```\n\n4. Now, when you `println` `my_length`, the output will be:\n\n   ```\n   1.8 meters \n   ```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like to explore other aspects of working with units in Julia!","status":200,"tokens":[73,451],"elapsed":1.992907542,"cost":0.0001048,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":31866827,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
