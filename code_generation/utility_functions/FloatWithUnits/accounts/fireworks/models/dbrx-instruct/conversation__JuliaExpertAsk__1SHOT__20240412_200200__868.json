The `Base.show` notation is used to extend the built-in `show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(f)\n1.8 meters\n```\nIn the example above, `f` is an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value","status":200,"tokens":[107,200],"elapsed":4.873240667,"cost":0.0004912,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1255102412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
