The `show` method is then defined for this struct, which takes an `IO` object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as arguments. The method concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between and prints the result to the `IO` object.\n\nYou can use this struct and `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":4.360559291,"cost":0.00043519999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1391432882,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
