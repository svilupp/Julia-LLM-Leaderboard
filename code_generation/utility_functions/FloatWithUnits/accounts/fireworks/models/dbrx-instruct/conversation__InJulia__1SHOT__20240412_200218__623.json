The `show` method is defined to take an `IO` object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as arguments, and it will print the `value` followed by a space and the `unit`.\n\nYou can test this by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and calling `show` on it:\n\n```\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":3.888991708,"cost":0.00043519999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1071284145,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
