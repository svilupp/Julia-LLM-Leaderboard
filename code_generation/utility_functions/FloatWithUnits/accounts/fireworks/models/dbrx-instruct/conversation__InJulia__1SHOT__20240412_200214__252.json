Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` and `unit`. The `value` field holds a floating-point number, and the `unit` field holds a string representing the unit of measurement.\n\nThe `show` method is then defined to take an `IO` object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. It concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between using string interpolation.\n\nNow, when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value and unit with a space","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":3.562423125,"cost":0.00043519999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":831646882,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
