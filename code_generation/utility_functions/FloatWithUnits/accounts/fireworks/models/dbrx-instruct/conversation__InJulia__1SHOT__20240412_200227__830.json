The `show` method is also defined for this struct, which will concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is displayed.\n\nYou can test it by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it:\n\n```julia\njulia> my_float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\nj","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":4.555618334,"cost":0.00043519999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":404596226,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
