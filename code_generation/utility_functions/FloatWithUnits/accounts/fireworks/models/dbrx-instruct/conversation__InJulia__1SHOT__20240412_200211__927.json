We then define a new method for the `show` function that takes an `IO` object `io` and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` `x`. The `show` method concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields of `x` with a space and prints the result to `io`.\n\nWith this definition, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them to the console like","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":4.169082292,"cost":0.00043519999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-285958168,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
