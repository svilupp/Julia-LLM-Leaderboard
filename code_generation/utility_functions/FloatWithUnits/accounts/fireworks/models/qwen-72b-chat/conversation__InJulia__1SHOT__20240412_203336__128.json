The method uses the `print` function to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the struct and print the resulting string to the `IO` object.\nTo test the `show` method, you can create an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and print it using the `println` function:\n```\n# create an instance of the struct\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# print","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":3.82365775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1546947328,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
