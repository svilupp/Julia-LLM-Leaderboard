In this case, the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` takes an `IO` object (which represents the output stream) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as its arguments.\nThe `print` function is then used to concatenate the value and unit fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object with a","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":3.817754375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1671300323,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
