The `value` is a `Float64` and the `unit` is a `String`. \n\nThe `show` method is then defined to take an `IO` object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. The `print` function is used to print the `value` and `unit` with a space in between. The `$(x.value)` and `$(x.unit)` are string interpolation to insert the values of `x.value` and `x.unit` into the string.","status":200,"tokens":[108,216],"elapsed":2.566875208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-381356754,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
