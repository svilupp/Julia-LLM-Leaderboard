The `show` method is then defined to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, as required. The `Base.show` method is used to overload the default `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type, allowing it to be displayed in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[108,183],"elapsed":2.180512167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1922742077,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
