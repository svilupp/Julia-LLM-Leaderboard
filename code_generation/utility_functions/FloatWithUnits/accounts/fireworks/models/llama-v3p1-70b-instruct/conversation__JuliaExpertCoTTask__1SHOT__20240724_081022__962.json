We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` using the `Base.show` function. This method takes two arguments: `io` (the output stream) and `x` (the `FloatWithUnits` instance to be shown). The `print` function is used to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n3. In the example usage, we create a `FloatWithUnits` instance with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\" and print it to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[177,275],"elapsed":2.882014042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1109699414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
