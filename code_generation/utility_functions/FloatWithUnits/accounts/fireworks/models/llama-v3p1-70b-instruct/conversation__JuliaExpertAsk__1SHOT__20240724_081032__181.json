The `show` method takes two arguments: an `IO` object `io` and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` `x`.\n*   Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to print the value and unit of `x` to the `IO` object `io`, separated by a space. The `$(x.value)` and `$(x.unit)` syntax is used to interpolate the values of `x.value` and `x.unit` into the string.\n\nYou can test this code with the following example:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,256],"elapsed":2.702887375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1333911802,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
