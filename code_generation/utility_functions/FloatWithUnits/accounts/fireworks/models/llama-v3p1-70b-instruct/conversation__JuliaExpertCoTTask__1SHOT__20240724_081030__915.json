We define a `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. We define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This method will be called when we try to print a `FloatWithUnits` instance. The `io` argument is the output stream to which the string representation of the object should be written. We use the `print` function to write the string representation of the object to the output stream. The string representation is a concatenation of the `value` and `unit` fields, separated by a space.\n3. We create a `FloatWithUnits` instance using the `FloatWithUnits` constructor.\n4. We print the `FloatWithUnits` instance using the `println` function. This will call the `show` method we defined to get the string representation of the object, and then print that string to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[177,310],"elapsed":2.99228925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-19741620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
