It then defines the `show` method which, when called with an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, prints the value and unit (with a space in between) to the console. The `show` method is then tested with a sample `FloatWithUnits` instance.","status":200,"tokens":[177,179],"elapsed":0.746894875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1148508866,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
