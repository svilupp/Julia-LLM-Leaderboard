This function is used by Julia to determine how to print an object.\n* The `show` method simply prints the value and unit fields concatenated with a space.\n\nHere's an example use case:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # prints: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nNote that we're using the `println` function to print the `f` object, which will call the `show` method to determine how to print it.","status":200,"tokens":[73,243],"elapsed":0.966428333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":926563952,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
