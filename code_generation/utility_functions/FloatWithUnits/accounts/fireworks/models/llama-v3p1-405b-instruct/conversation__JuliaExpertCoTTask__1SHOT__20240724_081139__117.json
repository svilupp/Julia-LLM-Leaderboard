[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

When trying to show or print a `FloatWithUnits`, it prints the string interpolated from its value and unit, with the space in between\n\nFinally, we test the solution by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it to the console.
