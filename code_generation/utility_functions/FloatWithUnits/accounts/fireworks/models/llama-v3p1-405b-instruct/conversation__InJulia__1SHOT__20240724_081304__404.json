We use override the `show` function from the `Base` package which is the standard way of customizing text output in Julia.\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\n```\n\nThis code defines how to display your new struct with a specified format. When the show method is used with a `FloatWithUnits`, it prints the value followed by a space and then the unit name.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's an example on how to use the defined `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nfoo = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(foo)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[73,258],"elapsed":8.3633785,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":579658653,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
