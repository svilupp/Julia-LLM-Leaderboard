This can be done in Julia with the `mutable struct` or `struct` keywords. Since we're not changing the fields of the struct once it's created, we'll use the `struct` keyword for performance.\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\n## Step 2: Define the show method for FloatWithUnits\nNow, let's define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. We'll use the `Base.show` function for this purpose. We'll add a method to `Base.show` that takes an IO object, mime type and an object of type `FloatWithUnits`. For our purposes, we'll use `::IO` for the IO object and `::MIME\"text/plain\"` for the text/plain output. When you print the `FloatWithUnits` object, this function will be called.\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, mime::MIME\"text/plain\", fu::FloatWithUnits) = Base.show(io, mime, string(fu.value, \" \", fu.unit))\n```\n\n## Step 3: Test printing of FloatWithUnits\nLastly, we will test our new `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` to ensure it outputs as expected.\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Expected output \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThe final answer is: There is no answer like \"10\" or something similar that could apply to this problem.","status":200,"tokens":[108,358],"elapsed":11.364796625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2052077372,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
