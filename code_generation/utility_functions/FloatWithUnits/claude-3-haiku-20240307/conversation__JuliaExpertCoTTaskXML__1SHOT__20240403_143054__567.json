Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n3. Test the solution with the provided example data.\n\nThis solution ensures that when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value and unit in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[217,269],"elapsed":2.824464417,"cost":0.0003905,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11273,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
