Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them, and print the result to the `IO` object.\n\nThis will ensure that the `FloatWithUnits` instance is printed in the desired format when it is used in a `println` or similar statement.","status":200,"tokens":[217,317],"elapsed":3.004184166,"cost":0.0004505,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5186,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
