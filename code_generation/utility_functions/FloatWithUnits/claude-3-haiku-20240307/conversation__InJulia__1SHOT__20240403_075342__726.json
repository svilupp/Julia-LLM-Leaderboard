The method takes two arguments: the `IO` object (for the output stream) and the `FloatWithUnits` object itself.\n\nInside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object, separated by a space. The resulting string is then printed to the output stream.\n\nWhen you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, the custom `show` method is automatically called, and the object is displayed in the desired format: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[71,315],"elapsed":3.09859625,"cost":0.0004115000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26309,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
