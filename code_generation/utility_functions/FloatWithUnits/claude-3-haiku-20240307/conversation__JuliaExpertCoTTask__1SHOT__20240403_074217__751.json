I defined the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields as requested.\n2. I wrote the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct, which concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them.\n3. I solved the task by creating an example `FloatWithUnits` object and printing it, which outputs the expected \"1.8 meters\" format.\n4. I checked that the solution works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[183,234],"elapsed":2.567217708,"cost":0.00033825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24076,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
