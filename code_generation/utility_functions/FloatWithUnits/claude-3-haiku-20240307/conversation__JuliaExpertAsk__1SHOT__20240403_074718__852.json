Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` (of type `Float64`) and `unit` (of type `String`).\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes two arguments: `io` (the I/O stream to write to) and `x` (the `FloatWithUnits` instance to be printed).\n3. Inside the `show` method, we concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields using string interpolation and print the result to the `io` stream.\n\nWith this implementation, creating and printing a `FloatWithUnits` instance will look like this:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,258],"elapsed":2.351546959,"cost":0.00034950000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3231,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
