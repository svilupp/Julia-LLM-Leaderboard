It then prints the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output shows that the `show` method correctly concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[183,350],"elapsed":2.893963167,"cost":0.00048325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3832,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
