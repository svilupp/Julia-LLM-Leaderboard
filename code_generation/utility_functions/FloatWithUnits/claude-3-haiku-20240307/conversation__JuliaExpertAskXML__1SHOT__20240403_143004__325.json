Then, we implement the `Base.show` method for this struct, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. Inside the `show` method, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and print the resulting string to the `IO` object.","status":200,"tokens":[113,176],"elapsed":2.1123755,"cost":0.00024825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24231,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
