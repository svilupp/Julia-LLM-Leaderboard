We define a `struct` called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`).\n2. We implement the `Base.show` method, which is called when you print or display an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an `IO` object (the output stream) and the `FloatWithUnits` object itself as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between using string interpolation `\"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\"` and print the result to the output stream `io`.\n\nNow, you can use this `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n\n```julia\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method will handle the formatting of the output for you.","status":200,"tokens":[108,317],"elapsed":3.044502708,"cost":0.00042325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
