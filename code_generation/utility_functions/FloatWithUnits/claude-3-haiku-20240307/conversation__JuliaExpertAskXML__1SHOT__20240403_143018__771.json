Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes two arguments: `io` (the I/O stream to write to) and `x` (the `FloatWithUnits` instance to be displayed).\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nThis will produce the desired output of \"1.8 meters\" when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[113,237],"elapsed":3.234598625,"cost":0.00032450000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8269,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
