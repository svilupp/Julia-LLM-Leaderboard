Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments. This method will be called when you try to print or display the `FloatWithUnits` object.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between using string interpolation `\"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\"`.\n\nWith this implementation, you can now create and display `FloatWithUnits` objects like this:\n\n```julia\nobj = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(obj)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,287],"elapsed":2.604025792,"cost":0.00038575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19868,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
