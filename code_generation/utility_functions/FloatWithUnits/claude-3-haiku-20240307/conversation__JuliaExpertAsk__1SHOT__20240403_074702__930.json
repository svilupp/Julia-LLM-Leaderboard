Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`) fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between and print the result to the `IO` object.\n\nThis way, when you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and print it, it will display the value and unit as a single string, e.g., `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,224],"elapsed":2.44909825,"cost":0.00030700000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14514,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
