The `Base.show` function is a method provided by Julia's standard library that is called when you try to print or display an object. In our case, we're overriding this method to display the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` struct separated by a space.\n\nYou can use this `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe custom `show` method will be called automatically when you try to print or display a `FloatWithUnits` object, and it will print the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[71,324],"elapsed":2.9536815,"cost":0.00042275000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21940,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
