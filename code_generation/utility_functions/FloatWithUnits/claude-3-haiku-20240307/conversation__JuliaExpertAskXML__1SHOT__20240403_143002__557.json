Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`) fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and print the resulting string to the `IO` object.\n\nThis will ensure that whenever a `FloatWithUnits` instance is printed, it will display the value and unit in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[113,228],"elapsed":2.424343916,"cost":0.00031325000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10327,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
