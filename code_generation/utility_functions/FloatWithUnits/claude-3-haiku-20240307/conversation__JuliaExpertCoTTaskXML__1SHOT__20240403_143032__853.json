Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between using string interpolation.\n\nThis will ensure that when you print a `FloatWithUnits` instance, it will display the value and unit as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[217,287],"elapsed":2.938863458,"cost":0.000413,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29892,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
