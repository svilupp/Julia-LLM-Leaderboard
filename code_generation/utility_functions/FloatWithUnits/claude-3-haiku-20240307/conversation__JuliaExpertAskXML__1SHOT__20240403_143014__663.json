We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields, separated by a space, and print the result to the `IO` object.\n\nWith this implementation, you can use the `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,280],"elapsed":2.827625375,"cost":0.00037825000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5950,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
