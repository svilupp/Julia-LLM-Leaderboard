This method uses the `string` function to convert the `value` field to a string, concatenates it with the `unit` field using a space, and then prints the resulting string to the output stream using the `print` function.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - The solution is the implementation of the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\n4. **Check the correctness**:\n   - To test the solution, we can create an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and print it:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output shows that the `show` method correctly concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[183,453],"elapsed":4.345739209,"cost":0.000612,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22722,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
