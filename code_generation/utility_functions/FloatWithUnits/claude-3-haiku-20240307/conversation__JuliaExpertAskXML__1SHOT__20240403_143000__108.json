Define a `struct` named `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`).\n2. Implement a `show` method that takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments, and prints the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space.\n3. The `Base.show` function is the standard way to define how an object should be printed when using `println` or other print functions.","status":200,"tokens":[113,278],"elapsed":3.010733542,"cost":0.00037575000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
