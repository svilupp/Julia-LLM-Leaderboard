Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes two arguments: the IO stream (`io::IO`) and the object to be displayed (`x::FloatWithUnits`).\n3. Inside the `show` method, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and print the result to the given IO stream.\n\nThis will ensure that when you print an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, it will display the value and unit in the desired format, e.g., `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,241],"elapsed":2.433849083,"cost":0.00032825000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6279,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
