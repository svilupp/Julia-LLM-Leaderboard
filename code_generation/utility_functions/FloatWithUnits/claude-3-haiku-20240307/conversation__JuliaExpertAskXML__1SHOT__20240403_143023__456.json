Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nWith this implementation, you can now display instances of `FloatWithUnits` as desired:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,244],"elapsed":2.467675833,"cost":0.00033325000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
