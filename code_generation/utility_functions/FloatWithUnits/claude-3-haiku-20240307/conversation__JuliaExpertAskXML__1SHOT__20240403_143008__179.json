Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. Implement the `Base.show` method, which takes two arguments: the `IO` object (where the output should be written) and the `FloatWithUnits` instance.\n3. Inside the `show` method, use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nThis will ensure that when you print a `FloatWithUnits` instance, it will be displayed as \"1.8 meters\" or any other value and unit combination.","status":200,"tokens":[113,242],"elapsed":3.151760584,"cost":0.00033075000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23618,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
