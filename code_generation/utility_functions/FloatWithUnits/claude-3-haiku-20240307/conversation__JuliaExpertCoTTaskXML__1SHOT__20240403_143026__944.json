Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments, and prints the concatenation of the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n3. Create an example `FloatWithUnits` instance and print it to verify the output.","status":200,"tokens":[217,313],"elapsed":3.475536833,"cost":0.00044550000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5373,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
