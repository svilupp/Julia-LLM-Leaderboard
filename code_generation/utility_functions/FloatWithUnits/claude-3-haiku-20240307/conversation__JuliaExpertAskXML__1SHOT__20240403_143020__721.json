The `FloatWithUnits` struct has two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. The `Base.show` method is overloaded to take an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between and print the result to the `IO` object.\n\nThis implementation will ensure that when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will be displayed in the desired format, e.g., `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[113,245],"elapsed":2.459466792,"cost":0.00033450000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23691,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
