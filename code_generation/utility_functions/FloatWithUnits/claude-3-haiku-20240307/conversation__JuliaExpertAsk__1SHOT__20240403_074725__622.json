We define a `struct` called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We then define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nThis will ensure that when you print a `FloatWithUnits` object, it will be displayed in the desired format, e.g., `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,247],"elapsed":2.491638208,"cost":0.00033575000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17967,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
