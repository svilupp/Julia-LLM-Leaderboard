We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We then implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. The `Base.show` function is a generic function in Julia that is called when you try to display an object (e.g., when you print it or include it in a string).\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object, separated by a space.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\n# Create a FloatWithUnits object\ndistance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display the object\nprintln(distance)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, when we print the `distance` object, the `show` method is called, and it outputs the value and unit concatenated with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[71,348],"elapsed":3.499033458,"cost":0.00045275000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22723,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
