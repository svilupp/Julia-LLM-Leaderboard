The `show` method is defined using the `Base.show` function and it takes two arguments: the I/O object (`io::IO`) and the `FloatWithUnits` object (`obj::FloatWithUnits`). Inside the method, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between and print the result to the I/O object.\n\nWith this implementation, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be printed in the desired format:\n\n```julia\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,264],"elapsed":2.497331958,"cost":0.00035700000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7313,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
