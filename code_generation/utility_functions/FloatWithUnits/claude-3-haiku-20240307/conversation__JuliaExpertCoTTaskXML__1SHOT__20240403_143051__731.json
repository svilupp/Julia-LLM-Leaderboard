Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments, and prints the concatenation of the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nThis solution ensures that the `FloatWithUnits` instances are displayed in the desired format when printed or interpolated into strings.","status":200,"tokens":[217,325],"elapsed":3.241949584,"cost":0.0004605,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26461,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
