Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct, which takes an `IO` object and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them.\n\nThis solution correctly implements the requested `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct.","status":200,"tokens":[217,290],"elapsed":3.198135,"cost":0.00041675,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8010,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
