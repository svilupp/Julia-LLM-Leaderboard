The `FloatWithUnits` struct has two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. The `Base.show` method is overridden to take an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nThis way, when you create a `FloatWithUnits` instance and print it, it will display the value and unit as a single string, e.g., `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[113,243],"elapsed":2.562088792,"cost":0.00033200000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11638,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
