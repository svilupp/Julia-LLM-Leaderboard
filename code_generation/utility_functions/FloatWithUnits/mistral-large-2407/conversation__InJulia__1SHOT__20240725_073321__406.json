In Julia, you can define a custom struct and then implement a `show` method for it to customize how it is displayed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This method takes an `IO` object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and prints the value and unit concatenated with a space.\n3. We create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it to see the customized output.\n\nYou can run this code in a Julia environment to see the desired output.","status":200,"tokens":[67,286],"elapsed":6.029596333,"cost":0.0027749999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-415984030,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
