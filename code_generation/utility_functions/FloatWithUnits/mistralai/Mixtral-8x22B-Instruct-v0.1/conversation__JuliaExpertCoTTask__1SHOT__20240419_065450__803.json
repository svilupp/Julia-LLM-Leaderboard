The `show` method is then defined for this struct, which concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `show` method is tested by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[199,174],"elapsed":7.1754025,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":2117631973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
