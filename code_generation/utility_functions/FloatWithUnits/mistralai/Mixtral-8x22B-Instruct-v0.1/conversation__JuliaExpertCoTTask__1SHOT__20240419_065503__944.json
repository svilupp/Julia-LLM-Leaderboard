Then, I define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. Finally, I test the `show` method by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it.","status":200,"tokens":[199,182],"elapsed":6.348037709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1657350601,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
