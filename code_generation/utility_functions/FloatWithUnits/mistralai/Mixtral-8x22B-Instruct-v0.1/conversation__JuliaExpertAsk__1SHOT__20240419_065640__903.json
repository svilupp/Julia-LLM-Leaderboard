The `show` method is then defined to print the value and unit fields separated by a space.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method:\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(f)\n1.8 meters\n```\nIn this example, a `FloatWithUnits` object `f` is created with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\". When `f` is printed, the `show` method is called and the output is \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[118,270],"elapsed":12.907069042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1992305707,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
