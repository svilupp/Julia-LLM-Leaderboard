This function is called when the struct is printed using the print or display functions:\n\n```julia\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, string(f.value, \" \", f.unit))\nend\n```\n\nLastly, we'll test our `show` method with the given example:\n\n```julia\nmy_struct = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n@show my_struct #or println(my_struct) to demonstrate the output\n# Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that our custom `show` method correctly displays the float value and its corresponding unit as a string with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[202,230],"elapsed":14.9403045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
