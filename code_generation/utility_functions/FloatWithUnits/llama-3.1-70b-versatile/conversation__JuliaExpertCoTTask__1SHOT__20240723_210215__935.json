The `Base.show` function is used to extend the built-in `show` function to work with our custom struct. The test at the end creates a `FloatWithUnits` instance and prints it to verify that the `show` method works correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[178,196],"elapsed":7.598946666,"cost":0.00025986,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-460957610,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
