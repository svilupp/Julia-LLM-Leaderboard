We specify that this method should be called when the object is of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n* Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and print the result to the `io` stream.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\nNote that the `show` method is automatically called when we print the `x` object to the console.\n\nYou can also use this struct in more complex expressions, and the `show` method will be called automatically:\n```julia\njulia> println(\"The length is: \", FloatWithUnits(2.5, \"kilometers\"))\nThe length is: 2.5 kilometers\n```","status":200,"tokens":[74,339],"elapsed":11.164274667,"cost":0.00031147,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1855498043,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
