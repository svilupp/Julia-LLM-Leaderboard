We define a new `struct` called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`).\n\n2. We then define a `show` method for this struct by extending the `Base.show` function from Julia Base. \n\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io` (the output stream) and `fwu` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\n4. Inside the method, we use `print` to write to the output stream `io`. We concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of `fwu` with a space in between using string interpolation.\n\n5. When we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, e.g. `println(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))`, the output will be `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,278],"elapsed":6.106572291,"cost":0.004494,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
