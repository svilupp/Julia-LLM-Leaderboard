In this case, we define a `Base.show` method that takes an `IO` object `io` and an instance `x` of the `FloatWithUnits` struct. The method simply prints the `value` field of `x`, followed by a space and the `unit` field of `x`.\n\nYou can use this struct like this:\n\n```julia\nlength = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(length) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method will be called when you `println` an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, and it will print the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[113,290],"elapsed":4.876139708,"cost":0.004689,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21428,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
