Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields\n2. Define a `Base.show` method that takes the struct and an IO stream\n3. Inside `show`, print the value and unit joined by a space\n\nThis solution uses the `Base.show` function to customize how the struct is printed. The `show` method concatenates the value and unit with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[217,260],"elapsed":5.572621833,"cost":0.004551,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14811,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
