Define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit`\n2. Define a `Base.show` method for `FloatWithUnits` objects\n3. In the show method, print the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space\n\nThis defines a custom pretty-printing behavior for `FloatWithUnits` objects by implementing the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[217,243],"elapsed":5.039089167,"cost":0.004296,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
