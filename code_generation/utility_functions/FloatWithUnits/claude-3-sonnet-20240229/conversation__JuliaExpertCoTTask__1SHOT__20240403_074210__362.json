We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` by extending the `Base.show` function from Julia's base module.\n\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io` (an input/output stream object) and `fw` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to write the desired string representation to the `io` stream.\n\n5. The string representation is constructed by interpolating the `value` and `unit` fields of `fw` with a space in between, using string interpolation (`\"$(fw.value) $(fw.unit)\"`).\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, you'll see the desired output format:\n\n```julia\njulia> fw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> println(fw)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[183,326],"elapsed":6.428490167,"cost":0.005439,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9822,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
