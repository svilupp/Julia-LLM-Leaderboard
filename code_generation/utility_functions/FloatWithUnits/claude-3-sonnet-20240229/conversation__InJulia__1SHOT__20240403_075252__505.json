We define a new struct called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` (a 64-bit floating-point number) and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. The `show` method is responsible for how an object is printed/displayed when you call `show` or `print` on it.\n\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io` (an `IO` object representing the output stream) and `fwu` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use Julia's string interpolation syntax (`$( ... )`) to construct a string by concatenating the `value` and `unit` fields of `fwu`, separated by a space.\n\n5. The constructed string is then printed to the output stream `io` using the `print` function.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its custom `show` method:\n\n```julia\nlength = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(length)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n\ntemperature = FloatWithUnits(25.0, \"Celsius\")\nprintln(temperature)  # Output: 25.0 Celsius\n```\n\nIn the above example, we create two instances of `FloatWithUnits`: `length` with a value of `1.8` and a unit of `\"meters\"`, and `temperature` with a value of `25.0` and a unit of `\"Celsius\"`. We then call `show` on `length` and `println` on `temperature`, and both output their values and units in the desired format: `\"1.8 meters\"` and `\"25.0 Celsius\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,533],"elapsed":8.983345,"cost":0.008208,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18522,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
