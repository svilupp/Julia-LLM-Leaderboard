Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`\n2. Define a `Base.show` method that takes the struct and an IO stream\n3. Print the value and unit fields concatenated with a space\n\nThis implements the custom display behavior requested.","status":200,"tokens":[217,227],"elapsed":4.217501417,"cost":0.004056,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6709,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
