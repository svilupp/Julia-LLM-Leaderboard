Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. Implement a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` by extending the `Base.show` function from Julia's base library.\n\n3. In the `show` method, we use string interpolation to construct the desired output string by concatenating the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space.\n\n4. `print(io, \"...\")` writes the string to the output stream `io`.\n\nNow, we can create a `FloatWithUnits` instance and print it to see the custom `show` output:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[183,254],"elapsed":5.400059,"cost":0.004359,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25612,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
