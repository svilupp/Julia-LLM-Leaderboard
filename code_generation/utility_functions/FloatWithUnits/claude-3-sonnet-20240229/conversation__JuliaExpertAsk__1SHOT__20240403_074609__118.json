We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` by overloading the `show` function from the `Base` module.\n\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io` (the output stream) and `fwu` (the instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to print a formatted string to the output stream `io`. The formatted string concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields of `fwu` with a space in between.\n\nWith this implementation, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be printed in the desired format. For example:\n\n```julia\nfwu1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu1)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n\nfwu2 = FloatWithUnits(45.6, \"kilograms\")\nshow(stdout, fwu2)  # Output: 45.6 kilograms\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,356],"elapsed":5.584656417,"cost":0.005664,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7017,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
