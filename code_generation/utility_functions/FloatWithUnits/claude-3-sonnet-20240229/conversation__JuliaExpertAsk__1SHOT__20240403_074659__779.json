We define a new `struct` called `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We then define a new `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` objects.\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io`, which is an `IO` stream (e.g., `stdout`), and `fwu`, which is the `FloatWithUnits` object we want to print.\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` to print the value and unit fields of `fwu` separated by a space.\n5. The `$` is used for string interpolation, allowing us to embed the values of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` directly into the string.\n\nNow, when you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and print it, it will display the value and unit as desired. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,365],"elapsed":5.831132125,"cost":0.0057989999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29066,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
