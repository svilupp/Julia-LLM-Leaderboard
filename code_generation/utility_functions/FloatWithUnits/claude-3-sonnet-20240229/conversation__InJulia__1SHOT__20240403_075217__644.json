We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a `show` method for this struct, which is used to print the object in a readable format when it's displayed. This method takes two arguments: an `IO` object (which represents the output stream) and an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, separated by a space. The `print` function is used to write this string to the output stream `io`.\n\nNow, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they'll be printed in the desired format:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> temperature = FloatWithUnits(37.2, \"celsius\")\n37.2 celsius\n```\n\nNote that the `show` method is automatically called when you try to print an object (e.g., by typing its name in the REPL or by using `println`).","status":200,"tokens":[71,374],"elapsed":7.679457792,"cost":0.005823,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25281,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
