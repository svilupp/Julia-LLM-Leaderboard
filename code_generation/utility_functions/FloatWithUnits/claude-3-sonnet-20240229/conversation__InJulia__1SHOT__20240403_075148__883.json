We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` by overloading the `Base.show` function from the Julia standard library. This method takes two arguments: `io` (an `IO` object representing the output stream) and `fwu` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write the desired output to the `io` stream. We use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nYou can now create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and they will be displayed in the desired format:\n\n```julia\nfwu1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu1)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n\nfwu2 = FloatWithUnits(25.6, \"kilograms\")\nprintln(fwu2)  # Output: 25.6 kilograms\n```\n\nThe `show` method is automatically called when you try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits` using `println` or `show`. This is because Julia's `show` and `print` functions are designed to work with any user-defined type by calling the appropriate `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[71,444],"elapsed":8.387541333,"cost":0.006873,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14495,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
