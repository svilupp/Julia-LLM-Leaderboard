We define a `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` using `Base.show`. This method takes two arguments: an `IO` stream (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`x`).\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to print the `value` and `unit` fields of `x`, separated by a space.\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, x)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method is called when you print an object or `show` it in the REPL. It determines how the object is represented as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[183,280],"elapsed":5.260572166,"cost":0.004749,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1504,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
