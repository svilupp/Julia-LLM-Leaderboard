Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields\n2. Use `Base.show` to define how the struct should be printed\n3. Concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between\n\nThis implements the custom display formatting specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[217,224],"elapsed":4.760753834,"cost":0.004011,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17935,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
