We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a string type `T <: AbstractString`).\n2. We then define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` objects, which takes an `IO` stream and the object `x` as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use string interpolation to print the value and unit fields of `x` separated by a space.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits{String}(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, x)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method allows us to customize how `FloatWithUnits` objects are displayed when printed or shown in the REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[183,270],"elapsed":5.380399417,"cost":0.004599,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28651,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
