It takes an `IO` stream and a `FloatWithUnits` object as inputs, and prints the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space.\n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\njulia> fw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(fw)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,197],"elapsed":3.880018125,"cost":0.0032790000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
