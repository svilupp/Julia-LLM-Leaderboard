First, we define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We then define a method for the `show` function from the `Base` module, which is called when printing an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io`, which is an `IO` stream (like `stdout`), and `x`, which is the `FloatWithUnits` object we want to print.\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to write the formatted string to the `io` stream. The formatted string concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields of `x` with a space in between.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, the custom `show` method will be called:\n\n```julia\njulia> fw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> println(fw)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nNote that the `show` method is called both when printing the object directly and when using `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,341],"elapsed":6.706776125,"cost":0.005438999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18389,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
