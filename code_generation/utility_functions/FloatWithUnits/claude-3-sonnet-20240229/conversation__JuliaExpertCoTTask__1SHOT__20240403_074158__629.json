We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` using `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)`. This method will be called when we try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")` to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and print it to the given `IO` stream.\n\nNow, we can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method we defined will be called, and it will print the value and unit as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[183,310],"elapsed":5.352283125,"cost":0.0051990000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
