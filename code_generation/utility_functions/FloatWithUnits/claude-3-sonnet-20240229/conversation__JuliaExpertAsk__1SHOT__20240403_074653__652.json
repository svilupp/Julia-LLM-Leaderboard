We define a `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` (a 64-bit floating-point number) and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` by overloading the `Base.show` function from the `Base` module in Julia.\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments: `io` (the output stream to write to) and `fwu` (the `FloatWithUnits` instance).\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write the desired output to the `io` stream, using string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space.\n\nWith this implementation, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them using `show`:\n\n```julia\nlength = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, length)  # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThe `show` method is useful for displaying the contents of a custom type in a human-readable format. It is often used when working with the REPL or when debugging.","status":200,"tokens":[108,380],"elapsed":7.493811208,"cost":0.006024,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4138,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
