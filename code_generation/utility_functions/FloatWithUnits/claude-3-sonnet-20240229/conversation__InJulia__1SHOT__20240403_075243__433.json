We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct by overloading the `Base.show` function from the Julia standard library.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to print the string representation of `fwu` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`) to the given `io` (output stream). The string representation is constructed by concatenating `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit` with a space in between, using string interpolation (`$(...)`).\n\nYou can now create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them to see the desired output:\n\n```julia\nfw1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw1)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n\nfw2 = FloatWithUnits(3.14, \"radians\")\nprintln(fw2)  # Output: 3.14 radians\n```\n\nThe `show` method is automatically called when you try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits` using `println` or `print`. This method defines how the struct should be represented as a string when printed.","status":200,"tokens":[71,422],"elapsed":9.054874917,"cost":0.006543,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15011,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
