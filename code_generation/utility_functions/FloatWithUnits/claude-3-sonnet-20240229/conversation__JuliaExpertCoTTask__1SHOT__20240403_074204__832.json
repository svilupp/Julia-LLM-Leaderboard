We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a `Float64`) and `unit` (a `String`).\n\n2. We define a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` objects by overriding the `Base.show` function. This method takes an `IO` stream (`io`) and an object of type `FloatWithUnits` (`obj`).\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to write the desired string representation to the `IO` stream. The string is constructed by interpolating the `value` and `unit` fields of the `obj` with a space in between using `$()` syntax.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nobj = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, obj)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis solution follows the given task and demonstrates how to define a custom `show` method for a struct in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[183,287],"elapsed":5.407125792,"cost":0.004854,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23524,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
