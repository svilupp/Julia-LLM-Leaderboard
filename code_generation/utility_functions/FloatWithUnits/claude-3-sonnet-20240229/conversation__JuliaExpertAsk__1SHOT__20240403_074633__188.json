The `value` field holds a `Float64` value, and the `unit` field holds a value of type `U`.\n\nThe `show` method is defined for `FloatWithUnits` by overloading the `Base.show` function. It prints the `value` field, followed by a space, followed by the `unit` field, by interpolating them into a string.\n\nExamples:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits{String}(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, distance)\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> temperature = FloatWithUnits(37.0, :Celsius)\nFloatWithUnits{Symbol}(37.0, :Celsius)\n\njulia> show(stdout, temperature)\n37.0 Celsius\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,282],"elapsed":5.2637295,"cost":0.004554,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2853,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
