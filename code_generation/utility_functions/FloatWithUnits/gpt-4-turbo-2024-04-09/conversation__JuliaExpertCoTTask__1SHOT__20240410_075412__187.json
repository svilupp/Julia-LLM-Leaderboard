Define a `struct` named `FloatWithUnits` that includes two fields: `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement a `show` method for this `struct` so that it displays the value followed by the unit with a space in between, like \"1.8 meters\".\n\n### Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\nLet's first define the struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's write a `show` method for this struct:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fu.value) $(fu.unit)\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nWith the struct and the `show` method defined, creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it will display the float value followed by the unit.\n\n### Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nLet's check the formatting using an example:\n\n```julia\nfu_instance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fu_instance)\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nHere is the complete Julia code:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fu.value) $(fu.unit)\")\n\n# Test example\nfu_instance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fu_instance)\n```\n\nThis should function correctly and display \"1.8 meters\" as required.","status":200,"tokens":[174,371],"elapsed":9.069492,"cost":0.012870000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":392817499,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
