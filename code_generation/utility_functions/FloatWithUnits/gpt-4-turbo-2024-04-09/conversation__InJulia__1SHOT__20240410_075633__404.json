To do this, you can define a method for `Base.show` that will tailor the output format for instances of your struct.\n\nHere's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct along with a custom `show` method to achieve the formatting you described:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nHereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Struct Definition:**\n   - `FloatWithUnits` is a struct with two fields: `value` which is of type `Float64`, and `unit` which is a `String`.\n\n2. **Custom `show` Method:**\n   - This method is defined for the type `FloatWithUnits`. It takes two parameters: `io` of type `IO` and `fu` of type `FloatWithUnits`.\n   - The `show` function uses `print` to output the `value` and `unit` fields of `FloatWithUnits`, formatted with a space between the value and the unit.\n\nWith this setup, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and display them:\n\n```julia\nmeasurement = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(measurement)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the `println` function, Julia calls the `show` function internally to get the string representation of `measurement`. The result is that the value and unit are printed with a space between them, exactly as formatted in the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[70,381],"elapsed":9.985371292,"cost":0.012130000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1534024,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
