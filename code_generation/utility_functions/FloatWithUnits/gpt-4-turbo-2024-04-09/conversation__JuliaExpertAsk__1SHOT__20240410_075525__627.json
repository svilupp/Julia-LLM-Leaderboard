Hereâ€™s how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nLet me explain:\n- The `struct` defines a type `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (a floating-point number) and `unit` (a string representing the unit).\n- The `show` function allows us to define how `FloatWithUnits` instances are displayed. By overriding the `show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)` method (inside the `Base` module, which is needed for such standard method overrides), it formats the output when a `FloatWithUnits` object is printed, completing the task as specified.\n\nTo test this, you would create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(x)  # It should display: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[105,260],"elapsed":6.083464083,"cost":0.00885,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1859622385,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
