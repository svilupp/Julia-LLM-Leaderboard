In Julia, the `show` method can be used to control how objects are printed.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the Task\nAfter defining the struct and its `show` method, we will create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as specified in the Data section to verify that the display format is as expected.\n\nHere is the Julia code for these steps.\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Write the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fu.value) $(fu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Step 3: Example and verification\n# Let's create an instance and print it\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(float_with_units)  # Expected output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThis set of code will create the correct output when `float_with_units` is printed, displaying \"1.8 meters\" as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[174,309],"elapsed":8.605384625,"cost":0.01101,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":68592706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
