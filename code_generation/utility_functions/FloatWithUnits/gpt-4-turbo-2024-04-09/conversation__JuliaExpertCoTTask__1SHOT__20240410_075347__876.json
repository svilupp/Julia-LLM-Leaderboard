I then provide a custom `show` method for handling output of `FloatWithUnits` instances in a human-readable form. The `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` function ensures that the structure will be presented as `value unit` when printed or displayed.","status":200,"tokens":[174,189],"elapsed":4.487668292,"cost":0.007410000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":898898896,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
