Define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` (a floating-point number) and `unit` (a string).\n2. Implement a `show` method for this struct to format its output as described.\n3. Test the `show` method with the provided data to ensure correctness.\n\n### Step 1: Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the `show` method\n\nWe need to concatenate the `value` and `unit` separated by a space.\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test with the provided data\n\nAfter implementing the struct and `show` method, I will create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as provided and see the output.\n\n```julia\nfwu_instance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu_instance)  # This should output \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- The output \"1.8 meters\" matches the desired formatting, confirming the correctness of the `show` method implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[174,280],"elapsed":6.512359333,"cost":0.01014,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1507722970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
