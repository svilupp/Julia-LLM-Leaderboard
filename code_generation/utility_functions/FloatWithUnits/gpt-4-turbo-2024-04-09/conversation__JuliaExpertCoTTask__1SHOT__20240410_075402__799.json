Define the given struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit`.\n### 2. Implement a `show` method for `FloatWithUnits`.\n### 3. Use the example provided to confirm the functionality.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Defining the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implementing the show method to output the format \"value unit\"\nimport Base: show\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Test\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n@show fwu;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Defining the Struct**: `FloatWithUnits` is defined with two types: `value::Float64` for floating-point numbers, and `unit::String` for the unit description.\n- **Custom Show Method**: Implements Julia's `show` method, which allows customizing how objects of the type `FloatWithUnits` are converted to strings for display. Here, it prints the value followed by the unit with a space in between.\n- **Testing**: We check the implementation with an instance `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`. The expected output should be `fwu = 1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[174,303],"elapsed":7.013832916,"cost":0.010830000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-606077164,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
