We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We define the `Base.show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This method is responsible for defining how instances of the struct should be displayed when printed.\n\n3. The `Base.show` method takes two arguments:\n   - `io::IO`: The I/O stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits`: The instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct to be displayed.\n\n4. Inside the `Base.show` method, we use the `print` function to write the output to the I/O stream `io`. We concatenate `x.value` (the numeric value), a space `\" \"`, and `x.unit` (the unit of measurement) to form the desired output format.\n\nNow you can create instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and display them:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n\ny = FloatWithUnits(3.14, \"radians\")\nprintln(y)  # Output: 3.14 radians\n```\n\nThe `show` method will automatically be called when you use `println` or `print` on instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, displaying the value and unit concatenated with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[71,453],"elapsed":16.754677916,"cost":0.03504,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21230,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
