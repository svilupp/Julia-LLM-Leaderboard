We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. The `show` method is part of Julia's Base module and is used to define how an object should be displayed when printed.\n\n3. The `show` method takes two arguments:\n   - `io::IO`: An input/output stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits`: An instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\n4. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write the output to the `io` stream. We concatenate `x.value` (the numeric value), a space character `\" \"`, and `x.unit` (the unit of measurement) to form the desired output string.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, the custom `show` method will be invoked, and the output will be formatted as desired. For example:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance `x` of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of `1.8` and a unit of `\"meters\"`. When we print `x` using `println`, the custom `show` method is called, and the output is displayed as `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,474],"elapsed":16.994556125,"cost":0.036614999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31601,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
