We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. This method takes two parameters:\n   - `io::IO` represents the input/output stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits` is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that needs to be displayed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to write the output to the `io` stream. We concatenate `x.value` (the numeric value), a space character `\" \"`, and `x.unit` (the unit of measurement) to create the desired output format.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the custom `show` method will be invoked, and the output will be formatted as specified. Here's an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(\"The distance is \", distance)\nThe distance is 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the first line, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` called `distance` with a value of `1.8` and a unit of `\"meters\"`. When we display `distance`, the custom `show` method is called, and the output is `1.8 meters`.\n\nIn the second line, we use `println` to print a message along with the `distance` instance. The custom `show` method is automatically invoked to display the `distance` instance in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[71,499],"elapsed":18.217819708,"cost":0.038489999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17314,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
