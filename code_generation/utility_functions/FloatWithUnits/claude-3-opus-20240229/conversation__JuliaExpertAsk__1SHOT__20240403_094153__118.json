We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We extend the `Base.show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type. The `show` function is responsible for defining how an object should be displayed when printed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` function, we take the `io` (input/output stream) and the `FloatWithUnits` object `x` as arguments.\n\n4. We use `print(io, ...)` to write the formatted output to the `io` stream. We concatenate `x.value`, a space character `\" \"`, and `x.unit` to achieve the desired output format: \"value unit\".\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the `show` method will be invoked, and the output will be formatted as specified:\n\n```julia\njulia> height = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(height)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method allows you to customize how your `FloatWithUnits` objects are displayed when printed or output.","status":200,"tokens":[108,393],"elapsed":17.834659667,"cost":0.031094999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26840,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
