We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This method takes two arguments:\n   - `io::IO`: The I/O stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits`: The instance of `FloatWithUnits` to be displayed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print(io, ...)` to write the output to the I/O stream `io`. We concatenate `x.value`, a space character `\" \"`, and `x.unit` to achieve the desired output format.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the custom `show` method will be invoked, and the output will be formatted as \"value unit\".\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe custom `show` method allows you to control how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed when printed or interpolated into strings.","status":200,"tokens":[108,379],"elapsed":18.098240917,"cost":0.030045,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16238,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
