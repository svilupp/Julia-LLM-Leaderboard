[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

Defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` and `unit` fields of types `Float64` and `String` respectively.\n\n2. Defines the `Base.show` method for `FloatWithUnits` that takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance. \n\n3. Inside the method, it prints the `value` and `unit` fields concatenated with a space in between.\n\nThe test cases show that the custom `show` method works as expected, displaying the `value` and `unit` properly formatted with a space when the `FloatWithUnits` instances are printed.","status":200,"tokens":[183,282],"elapsed":12.983452,"cost":0.023895,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1370,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
