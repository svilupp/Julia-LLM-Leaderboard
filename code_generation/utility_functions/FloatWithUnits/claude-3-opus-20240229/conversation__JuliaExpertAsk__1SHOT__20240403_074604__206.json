We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit of measurement.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This method takes two arguments:\n   - `io::IO`: The I/O stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits`: The instance of `FloatWithUnits` to be displayed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` instance with a space in between. The `io` argument specifies the I/O stream where the output will be written.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the `show` method will be called automatically to format the output. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> length = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe output will be \"1.8 meters\", with the value and unit concatenated and separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[108,375],"elapsed":15.104221792,"cost":0.029744999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2372,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
