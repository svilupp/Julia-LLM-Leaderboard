We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We extend the `Base.show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type. The `show` function takes two arguments: an `IO` object (`io`) and the `FloatWithUnits` instance (`x`).\n\n3. Inside the `show` function, we use `print` to write the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` instance to the `IO` object, separated by a space.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the `show` method will be called, and it will display the value and unit concatenated with a space. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method is automatically invoked when you display the `FloatWithUnits` instance in the REPL or when you use `print` or `println` on it.","status":200,"tokens":[108,327],"elapsed":12.375426292,"cost":0.026144999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2190,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
