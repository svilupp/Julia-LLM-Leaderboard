Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. Define the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe solution is correct.
