Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\n2. Define the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits`:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis method takes the `io` stream and the `FloatWithUnits` instance `x`. It prints the `value` and `unit` fields concatenated with a space.\n\n3. Test it:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe complete code:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nThis defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct, provides a custom `show` method for it, and tests it with the given example, producing the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[183,327],"elapsed":11.523448458,"cost":0.02727,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5004,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
