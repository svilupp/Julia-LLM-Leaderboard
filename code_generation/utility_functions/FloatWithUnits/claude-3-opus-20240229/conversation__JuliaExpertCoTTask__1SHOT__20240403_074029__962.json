Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`\n2. Write a custom `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` that concatenates the `value` and `unit` with a space\n\nCode:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nTesting it:\n\n```julia\njulia> FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe solution is correct. The `show` method properly formats the output by concatenating the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[183,195],"elapsed":10.139965542,"cost":0.01737,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12047,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
