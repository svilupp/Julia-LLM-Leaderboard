We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n\n2. We define the `Base.show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This method takes two arguments:\n   - `io::IO`: The I/O stream to which the output will be written.\n   - `x::FloatWithUnits`: The instance of `FloatWithUnits` to be displayed.\n\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to write the output to the I/O stream `io`. We concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of `x` with a space in between using string interpolation.\n\nNow, when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is displayed, it will be shown in the desired format. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method automatically gets called when the instance is displayed in the REPL or when using `print` or `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,344],"elapsed":14.143031708,"cost":0.027419999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
