We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields:\n   - `value` of type `Float64` to store the numeric value.\n   - `unit` of type `String` to store the unit associated with the value.\n\n2. We define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct by extending the `Base.show` function.\n   - The method takes two arguments: `io` (the I/O stream) and `x` (the instance of `FloatWithUnits` to be displayed).\n   - Inside the method, we use `print` to write the `value` and `unit` fields of `x` to the I/O stream `io`, separated by a space.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and display it, the custom `show` method will be called, and the output will be formatted as desired. For example:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe custom `show` method concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, resulting in the desired output format.","status":200,"tokens":[108,371],"elapsed":15.803728833,"cost":0.029445,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4492,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
