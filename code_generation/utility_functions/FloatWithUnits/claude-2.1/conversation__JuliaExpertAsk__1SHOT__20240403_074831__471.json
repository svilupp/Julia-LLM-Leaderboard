For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[106,249],"elapsed":7.441156958,"cost":0.006824,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14763,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
