Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits` is a struct with two fields: `value` (a 64-bit floating-point number) and `unit` (a string). The `Base.show` function is a method provided by Julia's Base module that allows you to define how custom types should be displayed. In this case, it prints the value and unit of `FloatWithUnits` instances with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[67,188],"elapsed":6.133854208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":530522302,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
