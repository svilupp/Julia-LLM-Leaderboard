Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits` is a struct with two fields: `value`, which is a 64-bit floating-point number, and `unit`, which is a string. The `show` method is defined to print the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `io::IO` argument is a standard input/output stream that's used by Julia for printing.","status":200,"tokens":[67,192],"elapsed":4.761306708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1498498412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
