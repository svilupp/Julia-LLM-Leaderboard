Here's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and the `show` method in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits` is a struct with a floating-point field `value` and a string field `unit`. The `show` method is defined to print the value and the unit with a space in between. The `Base.show` function is used to extend the default `show` functionality in Julia. The `IO` argument `io` is a stream that the output is written to.","status":200,"tokens":[67,195],"elapsed":4.408042292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1772211124,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
