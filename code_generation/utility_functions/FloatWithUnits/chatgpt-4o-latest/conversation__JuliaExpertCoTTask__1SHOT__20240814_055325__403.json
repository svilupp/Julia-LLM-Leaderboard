It will ensure that the value and the unit are concatenated with a space, e.g., \"1.8 meters\".\n\n### Step 3: Implement the solution in Julia\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct FloatWithUnits\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a custom show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Test the solution\nCreate an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and check how it is displayed.\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display it\nprintln(fwu)  # Output should be \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nRun the code and verify the output matches the expected \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[174,273],"elapsed":3.482000459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-515904775,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
