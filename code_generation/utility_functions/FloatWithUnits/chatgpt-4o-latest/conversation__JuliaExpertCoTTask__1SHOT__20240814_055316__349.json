Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` (of type `Float64`) and `unit` (of type `String`).\n2. Implement the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` to format the output as \"value unit\".\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, obj.value, \" \", obj.unit)\nend\n```\n\n### Test:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Show the result\nshow(example)  # Expected output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\n### Check:\n\nRun the code and verify the output. The expected output should be:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[174,206],"elapsed":2.314931833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-715394545,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
