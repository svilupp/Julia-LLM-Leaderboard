Below is the implementation for a `FloatWithUnits` struct in Julia, along with a customized `show` method to format the output as desired.\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a custom show method to display the struct as \"value unit\"\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, obj::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(obj.value) $(obj.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\nNow, let's create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it to see how the custom `show` method works:\n\n```julia\ndata = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(data)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nWith this code, when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the `value` and `unit` separated by a space as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[70,193],"elapsed":5.052591583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":237660865,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
