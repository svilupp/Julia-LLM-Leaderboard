Here's how you can define the struct and the `show` method in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits` is a structure with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. The `Base.show` method is defined for this structure to control how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are printed. The method takes an IO stream and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as arguments, and it prints the value and unit of the instance to the IO stream, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[67,194],"elapsed":1.387840667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2136478332,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
