The `Base.show` function is overridden for the `FloatWithUnits` structure, so that when an instance of this structure is printed, the `show` function will be called that we have defined. This function will print the `value` and `unit` fields of the instance, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[67,184],"elapsed":1.320201042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1222820356,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
