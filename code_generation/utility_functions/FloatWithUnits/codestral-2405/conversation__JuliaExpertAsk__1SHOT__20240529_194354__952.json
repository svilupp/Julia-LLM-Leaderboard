The `Base.show` method is overridden to print the `FloatWithUnits` object as a string in the desired format. This is done by defining the function to print the `value` and `unit` fields of the object, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[109,155],"elapsed":1.1191965,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2051570699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
