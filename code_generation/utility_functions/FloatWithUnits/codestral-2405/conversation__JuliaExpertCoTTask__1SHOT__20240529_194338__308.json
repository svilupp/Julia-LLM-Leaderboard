Then, a `show` method is overridden for this struct to print the `value` and `unit` concatenated with a space. Finally, an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is created and displayed using the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[190,173],"elapsed":1.251357167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":768909980,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
