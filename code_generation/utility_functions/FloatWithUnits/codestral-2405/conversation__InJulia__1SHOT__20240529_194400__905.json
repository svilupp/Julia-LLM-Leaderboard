The `Base.show` method is overridden for `FloatWithUnits` to print the value and unit in the desired format. When you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value followed by a space and the unit. For example, `println(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))` would print \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[67,214],"elapsed":1.568546292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":498868819,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
