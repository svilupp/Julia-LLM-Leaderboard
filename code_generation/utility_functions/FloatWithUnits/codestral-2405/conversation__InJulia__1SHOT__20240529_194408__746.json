Here's how you can define the struct and its `show` method in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We first define the struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` and `unit`.\n- Then we define a custom `show` method for this struct. This method is called when you try to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. It prints the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` instance with a space in between.\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, you'll see the value and unit concatenated with a space:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\");\n\njulia> println(distance)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[67,251],"elapsed":1.778398791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1055904378,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
