It is used to customize the way the object is displayed. In this case, we are concatenating the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[74,193],"elapsed":1.548684167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1222883020,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
