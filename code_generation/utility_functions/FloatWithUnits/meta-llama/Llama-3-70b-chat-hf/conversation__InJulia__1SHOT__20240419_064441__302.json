We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a custom `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` using the `Base.show` function. This method takes two arguments: `io` (an `IO` object, which represents the output stream) and `x` (an instance of `FloatWithUnits`).\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to output a string to the `io` stream. We use string interpolation to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `$(x.value)` and `$(x.unit)` syntax inserts the values of the fields into the string.\n\nWith this implementation, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call `show` on it, you'll get a string like \"1.8 meters\". For example:\n```\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(x)\n1.8 meters\n```\nNote that the `show` method is called implicitly when you display an object in the Julia REPL, so you don't need to call it explicitly.","status":200,"tokens":[74,353],"elapsed":4.968574292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-906294705,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
