This method takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. It prints the value and unit of the instance to the `IO` object, separated by a space.\n*   We create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` called `f` with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\".\n*   We use `println` to print the instance `f` to the console, which calls the `show` method we implemented.","status":200,"tokens":[74,286],"elapsed":2.041517834,"cost":5.888e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":206285663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
