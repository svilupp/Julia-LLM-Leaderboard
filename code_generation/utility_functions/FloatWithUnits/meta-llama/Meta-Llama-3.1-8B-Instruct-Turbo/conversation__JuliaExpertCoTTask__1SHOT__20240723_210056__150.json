Then, we define the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` using the `Base.show` function. This method takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments, and prints the value and unit to the `IO` object with a space in between. Finally, we test the `show` method by creating a `FloatWithUnits` object and printing it to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[178,216],"elapsed":1.712093375,"cost":5.668e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1888569168,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
