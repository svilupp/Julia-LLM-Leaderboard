We define a `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2.  We extend the `Base.show` method to support `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an `IO` object (`io`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`x`) as arguments.\n3.  Inside the `show` method, we use `print` to output the `value` and `unit` fields of `x` to the `io` stream, separated by a space. The `$( )` syntax is used for string interpolation.\n4.  Finally, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` representing a distance of 1.8 meters and print it using `println`. The custom `show` method is called automatically, resulting in the desired output format.","status":200,"tokens":[74,307],"elapsed":5.101925334,"cost":0.004974999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":569219240,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
