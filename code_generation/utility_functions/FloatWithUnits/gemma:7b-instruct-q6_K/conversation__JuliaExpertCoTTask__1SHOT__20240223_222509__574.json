Think through your approach:**\n\n- Define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit`.\n- Write a `show` method to concatenate `value` and `unit` with a space.\n\n**2. Write any functions and other code:**\n\n- Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the necessary fields and methods.\n- Define the `show` method with a `println` statement to print the concatenated string.\n\n**3. Solve the task:**\n\n- Create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with the given values.\n- Call the `show` method on the instance to display the result.\n\n**4. Check that your solution is correct:**\n\n- Check the output of the `show` method to ensure it matches the expected format.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The `String` type is used to convert the `value` and `unit` into strings.\n- The `. `operator is used to concatenate the `value` and `unit` with a space.\n- The `println` function is used to print the concatenated string to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":21.018399542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":32236,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
