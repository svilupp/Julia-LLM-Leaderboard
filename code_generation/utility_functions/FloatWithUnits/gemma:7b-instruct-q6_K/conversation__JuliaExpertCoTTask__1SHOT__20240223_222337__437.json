The output should be as expected.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `struct` definition includes two fields: `value` and `unit`.\n- The `show` method takes an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct as input.\n- The `String` interpolation is used to format the output string.\n- The `.unit` property of the struct is used to access the unit field.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":18.756690917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":24412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
