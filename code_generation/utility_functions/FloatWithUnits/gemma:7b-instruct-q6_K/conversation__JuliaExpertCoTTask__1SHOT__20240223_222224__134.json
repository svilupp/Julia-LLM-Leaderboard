The output matches the expected format.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `String` type is used to convert the `Float` value to a string.\n- The `.` operator is used for string concatenation.\n- The `println` function is used to print the output to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[162,269],"elapsed":18.587349125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":8600,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
