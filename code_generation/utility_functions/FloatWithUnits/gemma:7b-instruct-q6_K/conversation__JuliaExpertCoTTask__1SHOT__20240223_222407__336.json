I will write a `show` method to concatenate the value and unit.\n2. **Write functions:** I defined the `show` method.\n3. **Solve task:** I implemented the `show` method to concatenate the value and unit.\n4. **Check solution:** I created an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with sample values and called the `show` method. The output matches the expected format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":13.439112666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-32319,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
