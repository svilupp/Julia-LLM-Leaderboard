The `show` method is defined to print the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space. The `show` method is part of the Julia Base library and is used to define how objects of a custom type are printed.","status":200,"tokens":[108,181],"elapsed":11.108838625,"cost":6.58e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":848978994,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
