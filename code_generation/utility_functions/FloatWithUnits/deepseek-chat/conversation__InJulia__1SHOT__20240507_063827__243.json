Then, we define the `show` method for this struct. The `show` method is a special method in Julia that is used to display the value of a variable in the REPL or in other IO contexts. In our `show` method, we simply print the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[69,200],"elapsed":11.9743195,"cost":6.566e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-544893330,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
