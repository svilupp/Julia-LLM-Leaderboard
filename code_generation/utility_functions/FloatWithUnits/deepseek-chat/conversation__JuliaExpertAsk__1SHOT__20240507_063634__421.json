This method takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments, and prints the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` object separated by a space.\n\nNow, if you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and print it, it will display the value and unit separated by a space:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,282],"elapsed":17.521077292,"cost":9.408000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":369426724,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
