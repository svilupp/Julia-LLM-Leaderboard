[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `print` function is used to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `io` argument is an IO stream where the output will be written. In this case, it is the standard output (stdout).","status":200,"tokens":[187,218],"elapsed":16.296876042,"cost":8.722e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":474860967,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
