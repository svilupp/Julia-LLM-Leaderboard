Then, we import the `show` function from the `Base` module and define our own implementation of it. The `show` function is used to display the object in the REPL or when printed. In our implementation, we simply concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space and print the result.","status":200,"tokens":[108,199],"elapsed":12.566747292,"cost":7.084e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":624033476,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
