Then, we define a `show` method for this struct. The `show` method is a special method in Julia that is used to display the value of a variable. In this case, we override the default `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` to print the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[69,192],"elapsed":12.214108584,"cost":6.342e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-429803056,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
