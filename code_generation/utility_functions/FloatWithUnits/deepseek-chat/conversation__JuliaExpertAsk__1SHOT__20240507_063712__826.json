The `show` method is then defined to print the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `io` argument is an `IO` stream where the output will be written.\n\nYou can use this struct and `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,222],"elapsed":14.046142542,"cost":7.728e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1040106775,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
