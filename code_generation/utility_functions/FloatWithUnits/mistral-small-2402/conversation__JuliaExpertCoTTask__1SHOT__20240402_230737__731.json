The `show` method for this struct is then defined using the `Base.show` function. Inside the method, we simply print the `value` and `unit` fields of the `fwu` struct to the `IO` object `io` with a space in between. The example at the end demonstrates the usage of the struct and the custom `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[190,242],"elapsed":6.171399834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-196645014,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
