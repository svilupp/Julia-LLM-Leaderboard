In Julia, you can define a custom `show` method for your struct to control how it's displayed. Here's how you can do it for your `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nimport Base: show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, I first define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`. Then, I import the `Base: show` function to overload it for `FloatWithUnits`. In the new `show` function, I print the `value` and `unit` fields to the `io` object with a space in between.\n\nNow, when you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and print it, it will be displayed with the value and unit concatenated and separated by a space. For example:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[67,273],"elapsed":2.976893334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-543933409,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
