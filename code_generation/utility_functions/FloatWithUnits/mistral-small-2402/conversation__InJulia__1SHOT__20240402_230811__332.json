In Julia, you can define a custom struct and a `show` method for it as follows:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `FloatWithUnits` is a struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. The `Base.show` function is a method that defines how instances of `FloatWithUnits` should be displayed when printed to the console. It simply concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nYou can use this `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> my_length = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(my_length)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, the output is \"1.8 meters\", just as you wanted.","status":200,"tokens":[67,277],"elapsed":3.053026625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":252787399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
