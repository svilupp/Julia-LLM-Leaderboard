The `show` method is overloaded for the `FloatWithUnits` type to print the value and unit fields separated by a space. Now, you can create instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, and when you print them, they will be displayed in the desired format.\n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[109,225],"elapsed":2.583937334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2102452870,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
