Then, we define a custom `show` method for this struct that prints the value followed by a space and the unit to the given I/O stream.\n\nFinally, we test the `FloatWithUnits` struct and the custom `show` method by creating an instance with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\", and then printing it using the `println` function. The output should be \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[67,284],"elapsed":3.062918209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-351416121,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
