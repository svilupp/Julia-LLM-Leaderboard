Then we write a custom `show` method that takes an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and displays it as \"value unit\", where \"value\" is the value field and \"unit\" is the unit field of the struct.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Test the FloatWithUnits struct with the show method\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` (which is a `Float64`) and `unit` (which is a `String`).\n2. We create a custom `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` structs. This method takes an `IO` object `io` (which is typically `stdout`) and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` called `fwu`.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we print the `value` and `unit` fields of `fwu` to `io` with a space in between.\n4. We create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\", and then print it using the custom `show` method. This produces the desired output \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[190,372],"elapsed":4.123876959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1865255542,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
