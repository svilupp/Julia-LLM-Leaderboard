To test the method, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will print \"1.8 meters\" to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[109,201],"elapsed":2.316256666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":168317383,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
