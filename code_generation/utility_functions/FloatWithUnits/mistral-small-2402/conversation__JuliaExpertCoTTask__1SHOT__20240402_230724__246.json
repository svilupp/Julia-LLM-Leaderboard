The `show` method is then defined for this struct, which concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space. The `Base.show` function is used to overload the default `show` function for Julia objects. The `fwu` variable is then created with the given data and printed to the console using the custom `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[190,241],"elapsed":2.728936625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1982394942,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
