Then we define a custom `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This method accepts an I/O stream and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and it prints the value and unit to the stream with a space in between. In the test, we create a `FloatWithUnits` object with a value of 1.8 and a unit of \"meters\" and print it to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[67,263],"elapsed":4.425525416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-50549531,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
