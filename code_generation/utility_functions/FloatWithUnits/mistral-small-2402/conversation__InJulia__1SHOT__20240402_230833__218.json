The `show` method is overloaded for this type to print the value followed by a space and the unit when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is displayed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, `fwu` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of 1.8 and unit \"meters\". When `fwu` is displayed, it prints as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[67,258],"elapsed":2.815165959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-33319037,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
