The `Base.show` method is overloaded for this new type. The new `show` method takes an IO object and an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as arguments. It then prints the `value` field, followed by a space, and then the `unit` field to the IO object.\n\nYou can use this struct and method like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, the output is \"1.8 meters\", just as you wanted.","status":200,"tokens":[67,271],"elapsed":4.676516333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1671842418,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
