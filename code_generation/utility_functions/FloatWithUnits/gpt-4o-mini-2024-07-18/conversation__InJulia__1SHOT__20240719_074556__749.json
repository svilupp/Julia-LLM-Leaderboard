In Julia, we can define a struct called `FloatWithUnits` with fields for `value` and `unit`. Then, we can create a custom `show` method to format the output as desired. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a custom show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fw::FloatWithUnits)\n    # Concatenate the value and unit with a space and print it\n    print(io, \"$(fw.value) $(fw.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fw)  # This will print: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` (of type `Float64`) and `unit` (of type `String`).\n- We implement the `Base.show` method, which takes an output stream `io` and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. Inside the function, we format the output as required using string interpolation.\n- Finally, an example usage is provided to demonstrate how the output will look when we call the `show` method on a `FloatWithUnits` instance.","status":200,"tokens":[70,282],"elapsed":3.493575666,"cost":0.0001797,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1383262143,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
