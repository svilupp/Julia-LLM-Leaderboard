In Julia, you can define a struct and then create a custom `show` method to format how the struct should be displayed. Below is an example of how you can define a struct called `FloatWithUnits`, which has fields for `value` and `unit`, along with a `show` method that formats the output as you requested.\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a custom show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    # Concatenate value and unit with a space\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nf1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, f1)  # This will output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined with two fields: `value`, of type `Float64`, and `unit`, of type `String`.\n- The `Base.show` function is overridden to customize how instances of `FloatWithUnits` are displayed. It concatenates the `value` and `unit` with a space in between and outputs it to the specified `IO` stream (like standard output, represented by `stdout`).\n- You can create an instance of the struct and use the `show` method to see the formatted output.","status":200,"tokens":[70,304],"elapsed":2.901662125,"cost":0.0001929,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1784230814,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
