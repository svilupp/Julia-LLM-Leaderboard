Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement the `show` method to display the struct in the desired format.\n\nNow, let's write the code to accomplish this:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fw::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fw.value) $(fw.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw)  # This will invoke the show method\n```\n\nNow, let's solve the task and check our solution:\n\n1. We defined the struct `FloatWithUnits` with the appropriate fields.\n2. We implemented the `show` method which formats the output correctly.\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter running the provided example with `println(fw)`, the output should be: \n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis indicates that our solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[174,234],"elapsed":2.396977291,"cost":0.00016649999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1036092916,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
