In Julia, you can define a struct called `FloatWithUnits` with `value` and `unit` fields, and then implement a custom `show` method to format the output as specified. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the custom show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nfwu_example = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu_example)  # This should output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis code defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct and creates a custom `show` method that prints the value and unit with a space in between. You can replace the example values with any floating-point number and corresponding unit as needed. When you call `show`, it will format the output correctly as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[70,216],"elapsed":2.292357458,"cost":0.00014010000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":116362007,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
