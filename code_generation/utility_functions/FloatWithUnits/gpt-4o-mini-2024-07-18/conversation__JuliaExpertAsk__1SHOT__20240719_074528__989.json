Here's how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the show method for the struct\nBase.show(io::IO, fw::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fw.value) $(fw.unit)\")\n```\n\nThis definition allows you to create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and print them in the desired format. For example:\n\n```julia\nfw = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fw)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,149],"elapsed":1.937858583,"cost":0.00010484999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1992172020,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
