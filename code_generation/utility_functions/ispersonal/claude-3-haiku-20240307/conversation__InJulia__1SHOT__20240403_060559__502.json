We then use the `ispersonal` function to check if each of these vehicle types is a personal vehicle. The function returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. If we pass an instance of `AbstractVehicle` that is not one of the four defined subtypes, the function defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[104,395],"elapsed":3.716225208,"cost":0.00051975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29505,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
