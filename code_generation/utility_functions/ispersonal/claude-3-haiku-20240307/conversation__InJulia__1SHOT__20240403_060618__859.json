The function takes a single argument `vehicle` of type `T`, where `T` is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Inside the function, we use pattern matching with `if` statements to check the type of the input `vehicle`.\n3. If the type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vehicle is a personal vehicle.\n4. If the type is `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vehicle is not a personal vehicle.\n5. If the type is any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false` by default.\n\nIn the example usage, we create instances of `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`, and a generic `AbstractVehicle`, and then call the `ispersonal` function with each of them. The output shows that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not.","status":200,"tokens":[104,484],"elapsed":4.306869042,"cost":0.000631,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7056,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
