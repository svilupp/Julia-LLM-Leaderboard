For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function will return `false` by default.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that the function correctly identifies a `Car` as a personal vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[209,325],"elapsed":3.25194525,"cost":0.00045850000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13855,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
