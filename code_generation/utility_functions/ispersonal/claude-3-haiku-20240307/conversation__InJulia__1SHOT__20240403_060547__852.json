We then use the `ispersonal` function to check the traits of each vehicle type.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. If the input `vehicle` is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, indicating that these are personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n2. If the input `vehicle` is an instance of `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns `false`, indicating that these are not personal vehicles.\n3. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false` by default.\n\nThe example output demonstrates the expected behavior of the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```\ntrue\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[104,444],"elapsed":5.431293917,"cost":0.000581,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15992,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
