We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to represent the base type for all vehicles.\n2. We then define concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input and checks the type of the vehicle using the `isa` operator.\n4. If the vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, indicating that it is a personal vehicle.\n5. If the vehicle is a `Bus` or a `Truck`, the function returns `false`, indicating that it is not a personal vehicle.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false` by default.\n7. The example usage demonstrates the behavior of the `ispersonal` function for each of the vehicle types.\n\nIn the example, the `car` and `motorcycle` objects are recognized as personal vehicles, while the `bus` and `truck` objects are recognized as non-personal vehicles. The `other_vehicle` object, which is an instance of the abstract `AbstractVehicle` type, is also considered a non-personal vehicle by default.","status":200,"tokens":[104,516],"elapsed":4.718992959,"cost":0.000671,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-364,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
