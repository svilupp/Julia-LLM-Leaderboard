The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false` by default.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - The `ispersonal` function is implemented as described above.\n\n4. **Check the solution:**\n   - I provided an example usage of the `ispersonal` function with a `Car` instance, which should return `true`.\n\nThe key steps in this solution are:\n- Defining the appropriate abstract and concrete types for the vehicles\n- Implementing the `ispersonal` function to handle the specific vehicle types and return the correct boolean value\n- Providing an example usage to demonstrate the function's correctness","status":200,"tokens":[209,509],"elapsed":5.174902792,"cost":0.0006885000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14386,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
