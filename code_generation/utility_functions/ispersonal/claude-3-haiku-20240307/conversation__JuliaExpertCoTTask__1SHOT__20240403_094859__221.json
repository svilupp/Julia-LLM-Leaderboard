All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Defined an `AbstractVehicle` type and subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Wrote the `ispersonal` function that takes an `AbstractVehicle` and returns `true` if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, `false` if it's a `Bus` or `Truck`, and `false` for any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype.\n3. Provided an example of calling `ispersonal` with a `Car` instance.\n\nThe function correctly identifies `Car` and `Motorcycle` as personal vehicles, and `Bus` and `Truck` as non-personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[209,324],"elapsed":2.881777458,"cost":0.00045725000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26261,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
