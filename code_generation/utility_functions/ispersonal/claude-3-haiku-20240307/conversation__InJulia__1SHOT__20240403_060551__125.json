We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` as the base type for all vehicle types.\n2. We define concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, `false` if the vehicle is a `Bus` or a `Truck`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n4. In the example usage, we create instances of each vehicle type and call the `ispersonal` function to demonstrate the expected behavior.\n\nThe output of the example will be:\n\n```\ntrue\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[104,417],"elapsed":3.753895083,"cost":0.00054725,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11471,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
