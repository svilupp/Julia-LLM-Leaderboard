Define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the input `vehicle` and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Provide an example of using the `ispersonal` function with a `Car` instance.\n\nThe function correctly identifies `Car` and `Motorcycle` as personal vehicles, and `Bus` and `Truck` as not personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[243,339],"elapsed":3.342428666,"cost":0.0004845,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22181,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
