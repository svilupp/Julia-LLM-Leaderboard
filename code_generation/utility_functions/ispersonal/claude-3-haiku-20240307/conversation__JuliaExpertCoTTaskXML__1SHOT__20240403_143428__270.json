Define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Write the `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the input `vehicle` using `isa` and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype, it returns `false` by default.\n3. Provide an example usage of the `ispersonal` function.\n\nThis solution should correctly handle the requested task.","status":200,"tokens":[243,340],"elapsed":3.44537075,"cost":0.00048575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
