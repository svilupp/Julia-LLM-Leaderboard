All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`, for `Bus` and `Truck` it returns `false`, and for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,379],"elapsed":4.214529625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-332978778,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
