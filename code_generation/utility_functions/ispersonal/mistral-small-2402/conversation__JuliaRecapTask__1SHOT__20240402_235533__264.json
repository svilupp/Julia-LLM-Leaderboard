[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

In this case, it will call the specialized implementation for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and the default implementation for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nNote that we use the `::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax to specify that the argument to `ispersonal` should be a type that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This allows us to define a default implementation that works for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, without having to explicitly list all possible subtypes.\n\nAlso note that we use the `::Bool` syntax to specify that the return type of `ispersonal` should be a boolean value. This is optional, but it can help make the code more self-documenting and can provide some type safety.\n\nFinally, we provide an example usage of the function, showing that it returns the expected results for the four concrete types we defined, and for the `Any` type, which is a supertype of all types in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[407,542],"elapsed":6.221125959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1437180184,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
