All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is defined to take a type argument and returns `true` if the type is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[100,262],"elapsed":2.95014575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1451534710,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
