All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument, checks if it is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if it is and `false` otherwise. The function is then tested with several examples to demonstrate that it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[215,256],"elapsed":3.166351791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1236180041,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
