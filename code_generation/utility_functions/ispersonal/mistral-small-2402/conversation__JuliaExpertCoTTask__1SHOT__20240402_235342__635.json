The `ispersonal` function is then defined to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates that the `ispersonal` function works as expected for the provided types.","status":200,"tokens":[215,427],"elapsed":4.862177083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-972610453,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
