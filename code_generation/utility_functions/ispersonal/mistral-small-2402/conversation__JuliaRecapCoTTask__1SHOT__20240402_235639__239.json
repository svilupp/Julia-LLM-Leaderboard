[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is overloaded for each type using multiple dispatch, and returns the appropriate trait based on the provided vehicle.\n\nThe example at the end demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function with instances of each vehicle type, as well as an instance of an `AnyVehicle` type (which is assumed to be another subtype of `AbstractVehicle`).\n\nThis solution follows the guidelines for the Julia language by using multiple dispatch, preferring standard libraries, and emphasizing performance, clarity, and abstract types. It also follows the special instructions by providing a default behavior for any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[409,479],"elapsed":5.293325292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":988399931,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
