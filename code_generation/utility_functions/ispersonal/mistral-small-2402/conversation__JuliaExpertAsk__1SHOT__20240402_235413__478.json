All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```\nispersonal(::Type{T} where T<:AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\nThis function first defines a default method that returns `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Then, it defines two additional methods that return `true` specifically for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(CustomVehicle) # CustomVehicle is a subtype of AbstractVehicle that was not defined above\nfalse\n```\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and a hypothetical `CustomVehicle` type.","status":200,"tokens":[141,274],"elapsed":2.998258917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1203209010,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
