[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` that all vehicles will inherit from.\n2. Define concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. Define the function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument and returns a boolean value.\n4. Use multiple dispatch with the `isa` keyword to check if the provided `vehicle` is a `Union` of `Car` and `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it defaults to `false`.\n5. Provide examples of the function working with different types of vehicles.\n\nNote: The `Union` type is used to create a new type that represents the set of all instances of a given set of types. In this case, `Union{Car, Motorcycle}` represents either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`.","status":200,"tokens":[407,363],"elapsed":4.063144334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1488412090,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
