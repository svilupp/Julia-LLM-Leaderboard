All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function uses multiple dispatch to define separate methods for each of the supported vehicle types, and defaults to returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nIn the example usage, a `Car` instance is created and passed to the `ispersonal` function, which returns `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[215,253],"elapsed":2.806574583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":735712543,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
