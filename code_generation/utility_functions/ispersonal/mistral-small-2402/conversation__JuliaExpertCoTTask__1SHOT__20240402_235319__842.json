All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia code for the `ispersonal` function as per your requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(\"Car: \", ispersonal(car))\nprintln(\"Motorcycle: \", ispersonal(motorcycle))\nprintln(\"Bus: \", ispersonal(bus))\nprintln(\"Truck: \", ispersonal(truck))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `AbstractVehicle` type and four concrete subtypes for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the provided `AbstractVehicle` and returns a boolean value accordingly. The example usage demonstrates how the `ispersonal` function works for each of the four vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[215,299],"elapsed":3.308562917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1840178418,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
