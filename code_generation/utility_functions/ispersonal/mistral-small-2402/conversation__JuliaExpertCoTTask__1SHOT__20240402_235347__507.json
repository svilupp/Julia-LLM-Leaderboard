The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then we define a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument and returns a boolean value. Inside the function, we use the `isa` keyword to check if the vehicle is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle` and return `true` if it is. If the vehicle is of type `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we also return `false`. Finally, we provide some examples to test the function.","status":200,"tokens":[215,346],"elapsed":4.173700792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1297365615,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
