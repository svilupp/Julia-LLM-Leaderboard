It does this by providing specific methods for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, which return `true`, and a catch-all method for any type that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, which returns `false`.\n\nThe `AnySubtypeOfAbstractVehicle` in the example should be replaced with any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that you might have defined.","status":200,"tokens":[141,306],"elapsed":3.966039417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-586209909,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
