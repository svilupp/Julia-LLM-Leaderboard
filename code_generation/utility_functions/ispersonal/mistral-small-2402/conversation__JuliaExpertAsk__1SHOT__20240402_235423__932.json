All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `ispersonal` as follows:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct OtherVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(OtherVehicle))  # Output: false\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's multiple dispatch system to define behavior based on the type of the input argument. In this case, we define a default implementation for `AbstractVehicle` and override it for `Car` and `Motorcycle`. The function will return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,315],"elapsed":6.384100458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":605411991,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
