All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n  return isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\nend\n\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Output: true\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define Abstract Vehicle:** An abstract type `AbstractVehicle` is defined as a base type for all vehicle types.\n\n2. **Vehicle Subtypes:** Concrete vehicle types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are defined as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\n3. **`ispersonal` Function:**\n   - Takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n   - Returns `true` if the vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, indicating a personal vehicle.\n   - Returns `false` otherwise, covering all other subtypes, including `Bus` and `Truck`, and any other potential subtypes.\n\n4. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates the function usage by calling `ispersonal(Car())`, which prints `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[203,251],"elapsed":0.798105291,"cost":9.08e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":275539546,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
