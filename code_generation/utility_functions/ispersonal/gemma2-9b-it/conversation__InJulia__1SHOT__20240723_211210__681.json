All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it is, it returns `true` indicating it's a personal vehicle.\n    * If it's neither, it returns `false` by default.\n\n* **Example Usage**: \n    * Two instances, `my_car` (of type `Car`) and `my_bus` (of type `Bus`), are created.\n    * The `ispersonal` function is called with each instance, and the results are printed.\n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Traits and Subtyping:** Traits provide a way to define shared behavior or properties across different types. Here, `PersonalVehicle` acts as a conceptual grouping for vehicles suitable for personal use. Subtyping (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, etc., inheriting from `AbstractVehicle`) establishes a hierarchical relationship, enabling the `ispersonal` function to work based on the vehicle's type.\n* **Abstraction:** `AbstractVehicle` allows for polymorphism â€“ treating different vehicle types uniformly while still acknowledging their distinctions.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[101,505],"elapsed":1.265264292,"cost":0.0001212,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1598233878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
