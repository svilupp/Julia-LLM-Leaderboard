All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia. This function uses multiple dispatch, a powerful feature of Julia, to define different behaviors for different types.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus, Truck}}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example\nprintln(\"Car is personal: \", ispersonal(Car))\nprintln(\"Motorcycle is personal: \", ispersonal(Motorcycle))\nprintln(\"Bus is personal: \", ispersonal(Bus))\nprintln(\"Truck is personal: \", ispersonal(Truck))\n```\n\nIn this example, `ispersonal` returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,260],"elapsed":6.519235,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1510611691,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
