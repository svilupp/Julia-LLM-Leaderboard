All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus, Truck}}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example usage:\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)\nfalse\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function uses multiple dispatch to define different behaviors for different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The first method returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, while the second method returns `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` types. The third method acts as a catch-all, returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,288],"elapsed":6.863502166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2110011922,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
