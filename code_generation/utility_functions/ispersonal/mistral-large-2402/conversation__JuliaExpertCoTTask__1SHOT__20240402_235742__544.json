All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Here's a simple implementation based on your requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n\n# Example\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Output: true\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. We define the `ispersonal` function. It returns `true` if the provided type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. We provide an example using the `Car` type, which should return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[215,244],"elapsed":5.612058375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1342431862,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
