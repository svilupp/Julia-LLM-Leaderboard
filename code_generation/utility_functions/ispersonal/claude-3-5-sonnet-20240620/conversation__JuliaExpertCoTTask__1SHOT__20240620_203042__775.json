All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define the abstract type and subtypes\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function\n3. Provide examples\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Define abstract type and subtypes\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Implement ispersonal function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false  # Default for any other subtype\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # false\n\n# Example with a new subtype\nstruct Boat <: AbstractVehicle end\nprintln(ispersonal(Boat()))       # false\n```\n\nThis implementation satisfies all the requirements:\n- It works for Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck\n- Car and Motorcycle return true\n- Bus and Truck return false\n- It defaults to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle (as shown with the Boat example)\n\nThe function is concise and efficient, using the `isa` operator to check the type of the input vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[209,363],"elapsed":5.193736208,"cost":0.006072,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13539,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
