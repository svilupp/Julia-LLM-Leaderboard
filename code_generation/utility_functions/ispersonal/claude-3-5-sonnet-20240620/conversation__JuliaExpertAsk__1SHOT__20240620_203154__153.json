The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The catch-all method returns `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, while specific methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle` return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,217],"elapsed":3.749804917,"cost":0.0036780000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31824,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
