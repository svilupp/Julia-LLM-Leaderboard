All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution following the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through the approach:\n   - Define an abstract type AbstractVehicle\n   - Define subtypes for Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck\n   - Implement the ispersonal function with type dispatch\n\n2. Write the necessary code:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\nThe `ispersonal` function is implemented using multiple dispatch. It returns `true` for Car and Motorcycle, and `false` for all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle (including Bus and Truck).\n\n4. Check the solution:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # false\n\n# Test with a new subtype\nstruct Boat <: AbstractVehicle end\nprintln(ispersonal(Boat()))       # false\n```\n\nThis solution correctly implements the `ispersonal` function as per the given requirements. It returns `true` for Car and Motorcycle, `false` for Bus and Truck, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[209,385],"elapsed":5.350580959,"cost":0.006402,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22355,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
