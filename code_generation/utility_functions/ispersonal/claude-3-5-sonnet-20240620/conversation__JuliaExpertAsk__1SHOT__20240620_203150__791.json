All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of the `ispersonal` function with the requested functionality:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))           # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))    # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))           # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))         # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle)) # false\n```\n\nThis implementation uses multiple dispatch to define the behavior for different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The catch-all method returns `false` for any subtype not explicitly defined, satisfying the default behavior requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[141,232],"elapsed":3.227897834,"cost":0.0039030000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
