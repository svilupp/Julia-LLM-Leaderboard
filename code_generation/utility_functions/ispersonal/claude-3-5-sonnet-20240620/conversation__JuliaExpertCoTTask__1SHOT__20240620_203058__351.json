All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through the approach:\n   - Define an abstract type AbstractVehicle\n   - Define subtypes for Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck\n   - Implement the ispersonal function with type dispatch\n\n2. Write the necessary code:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   The function is implemented with type dispatch to handle different vehicle types.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   Let's test the function with different vehicle types:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # Should return false\n\n# Test with a hypothetical new vehicle type\nstruct Boat <: AbstractVehicle end\nprintln(ispersonal(Boat()))       # Should return false\n```\n\nThis implementation satisfies all the requirements:\n- It works for Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck types.\n- Car and Motorcycle return true.\n- Bus and Truck return false.\n- It defaults to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\nThe example `ispersonal(Car())` provided in the Data section will return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[209,399],"elapsed":5.84403625,"cost":0.006612,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4058,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
