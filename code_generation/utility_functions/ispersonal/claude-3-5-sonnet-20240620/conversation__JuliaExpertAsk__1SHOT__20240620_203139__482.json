The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The catch-all method returns `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, while specific methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle` return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,210],"elapsed":3.25194525,"cost":0.0035730000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4738,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
