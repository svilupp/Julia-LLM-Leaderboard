All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if so, and `false` otherwise. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior for each vehicle type.","status":200,"tokens":[200,233],"elapsed":1.35115275,"cost":0.00030207,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2142465067,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
