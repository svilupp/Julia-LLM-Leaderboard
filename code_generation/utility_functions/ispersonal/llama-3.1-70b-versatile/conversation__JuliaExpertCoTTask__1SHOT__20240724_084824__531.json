[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function uses the `in` operator to check if the given type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if so, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[200,224],"elapsed":1.368640083,"cost":0.00029496,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1686273353,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
