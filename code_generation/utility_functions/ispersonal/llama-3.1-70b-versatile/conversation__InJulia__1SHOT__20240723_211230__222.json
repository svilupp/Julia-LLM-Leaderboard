We then define the `ispersonal` function using multiple dispatch. The function takes a type as an argument and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[103,277],"elapsed":3.978504958,"cost":0.00027959999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":255529574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
