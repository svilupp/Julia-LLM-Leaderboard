[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

In this case, we have five different implementations: one for each of the four concrete types and one for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe first two implementations return `true`, indicating that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are personal vehicles. The next two implementations return `false`, indicating that `Bus` and `Truck` are not personal vehicles. The last implementation returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFinally, we test the function with some examples and print the results.","status":200,"tokens":[416,391],"elapsed":14.205296333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1199302878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
