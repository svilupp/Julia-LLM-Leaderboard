The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is defined to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The `::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}` syntax is used to match any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[150,225],"elapsed":9.442705625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1215364317,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
