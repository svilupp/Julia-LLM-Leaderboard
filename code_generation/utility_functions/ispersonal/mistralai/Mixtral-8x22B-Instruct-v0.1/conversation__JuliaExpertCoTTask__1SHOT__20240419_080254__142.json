The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. The example provided at the end of the code demonstrates that the function returns `true` when called with a `Car` object.","status":200,"tokens":[224,202],"elapsed":8.25786975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":843604462,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
