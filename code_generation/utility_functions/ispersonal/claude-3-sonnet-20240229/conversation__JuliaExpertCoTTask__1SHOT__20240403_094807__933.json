The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Define concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Implement the `ispersonal` function that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n4. Inside the function, check if the input vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle` using the `isa` operator. If it is, return `true`.\n5. If the input vehicle is a `Bus` or `Truck`, return `false`.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, return `false` as the default case.\n7. Provide examples of using the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Use the `isa` operator to check the type of the input vehicle.\n- Handle the specific cases for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as required.\n- Use a default case to handle any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n- Provide examples to demonstrate the usage and correctness of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[209,434],"elapsed":7.494804458,"cost":0.007137,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25306,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
