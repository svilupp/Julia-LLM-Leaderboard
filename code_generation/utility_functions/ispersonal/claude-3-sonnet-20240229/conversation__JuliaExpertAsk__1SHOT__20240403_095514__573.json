All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is defined with separate method definitions for each subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This allows us to handle each vehicle type differently while still providing a default behavior for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe function uses the `Type` parametric type to dispatch on the concrete type of the input argument. For example, `ispersonal(::Type{<:Car})` matches any type that is a subtype of `Car`. The function then returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` types.\n\nThe last method definition `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` serves as a catchall case, returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly handled by the previous method definitions.\n\nIn the example usage, we create an instance of `MyVehicle`, which is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, and call `ispersonal(MyVehicle)`. Since there is no explicit method definition for `MyVehicle`, the catchall case is invoked, and the function returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,530],"elapsed":9.595533083,"cost":0.008373,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6227,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
