[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The `ispersonal` function takes an instance of `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle` (considered personal vehicles), and `false` if it's a `Bus` or `Truck` (considered non-personal vehicles). For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n\nThe examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the `ispersonal` function with instances of each vehicle type, including a new `Tractor` type that defaults to `false` since it's not explicitly handled in the function.","status":200,"tokens":[392,529],"elapsed":9.570539208,"cost":0.009111,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30785,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
