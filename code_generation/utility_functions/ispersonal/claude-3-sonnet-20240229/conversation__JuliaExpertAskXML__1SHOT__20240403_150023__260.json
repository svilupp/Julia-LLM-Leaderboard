All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

The function uses multiple dispatch to handle different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFor the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, indicating they are personal vehicles. For the types `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`.\n\nThe last method `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false` acts as a default catch-all method that returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly handled by the other methods.\n\nThe examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[146,352],"elapsed":7.533951917,"cost":0.005718,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2680,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
