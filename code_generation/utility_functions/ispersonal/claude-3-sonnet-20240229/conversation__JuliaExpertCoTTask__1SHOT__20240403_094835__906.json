All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. The `ispersonal` function takes an argument `v` of type `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Inside the function, we use a series of `if-elseif-else` conditions to check the type of `v`.\n4. If `v` is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, we return `true` since these are considered personal vehicles.\n5. If `v` is of type `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `false` since these are not considered personal vehicles.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we return `false` by default.\n\nThe example shows how to call the `ispersonal` function with instances of different vehicle types, demonstrating the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[209,384],"elapsed":7.079687208,"cost":0.006387,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4847,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
