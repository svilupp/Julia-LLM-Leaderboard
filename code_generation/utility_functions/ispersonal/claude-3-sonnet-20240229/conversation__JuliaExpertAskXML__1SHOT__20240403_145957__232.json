All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T === Car || T === Motorcycle\nend\n\nispersonal(Car) # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle) # returns true\nispersonal(Bus) # returns false\nispersonal(Truck) # returns false\nispersonal(AbstractVehicle) # returns false (default)\n```\n\nIn this example, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function takes a vehicle type `T` as input and returns `true` if `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false`.\n\nThe function uses a `where` clause to constrain the input type `T` to be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The body of the function simply checks if `T` is equal to `Car` or `Motorcycle` using the `===` operator, which tests for identity equality. If either condition is true, it returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types. Note that if you pass a type that is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function will not be able to handle it, as the `where` clause restricts the input type.","status":200,"tokens":[146,385],"elapsed":7.784524375,"cost":0.006213,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5002,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
