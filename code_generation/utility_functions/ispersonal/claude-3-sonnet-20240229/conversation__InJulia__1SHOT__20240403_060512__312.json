We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to represent the base type for all vehicles.\n2. We define four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. The `ispersonal` function is defined with multiple method signatures to handle different vehicle types:\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})` return `true` because `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{Bus})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Truck})` return `false` because `Bus` and `Truck` are not considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` is a catch-all method that returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This ensures that if a new subtype is added in the future, it will default to `false` unless a specific method is defined for it.\n4. In the example usage, we call the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types to demonstrate the behavior.\n\nYou can extend this function to include more vehicle types by adding new method signatures for those types. If a new vehicle type should be considered a personal vehicle, you can define a new method that returns `true` for that type.","status":200,"tokens":[104,558],"elapsed":8.997921292,"cost":0.008682,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3948,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
