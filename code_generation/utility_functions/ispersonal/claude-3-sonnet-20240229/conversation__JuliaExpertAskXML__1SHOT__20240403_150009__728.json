The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function checks the input type and returns `true` if it's a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise (for `Bus`, `Truck`, or any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`).\n\nThe example at the end demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[146,294],"elapsed":5.202900416,"cost":0.004848,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2110,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
