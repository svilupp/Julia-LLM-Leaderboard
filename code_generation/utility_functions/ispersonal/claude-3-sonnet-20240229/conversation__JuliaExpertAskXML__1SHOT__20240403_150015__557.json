The function uses the `===` operator to check if the type `T` is exactly `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns `true`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, including `Bus`, `Truck`, and `AbstractVehicle` itself, the function returns `false`.\n\nThe examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[146,312],"elapsed":6.109409042,"cost":0.005118,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11850,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
