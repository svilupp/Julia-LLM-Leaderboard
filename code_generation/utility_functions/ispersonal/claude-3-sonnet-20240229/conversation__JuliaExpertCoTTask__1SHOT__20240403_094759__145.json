We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, and then define concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. The `ispersonal` function takes a single argument `vehicle` of type `T`, which is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Inside the function, we use a series of `if`/`elseif`/`else` statements to check the type of `vehicle`.\n4. If `T` is a subtype of `Union{Car, Motorcycle}`, we return `true`, indicating that these vehicle types are considered personal vehicles.\n5. If `T` is a subtype of `Union{Bus, Truck}`, we return `false`, indicating that these vehicle types are not considered personal vehicles.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we return `false` by default.\n7. In the example section, we create instances of each vehicle type and call the `ispersonal` function with them, demonstrating the expected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[209,433],"elapsed":8.496574708,"cost":0.007122,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
