All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

First, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n3. Inside the function, we use the `isa` operator to check the type of the input vehicle.\n4. If the vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, we return `true`.\n5. If the vehicle is a `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `false`.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we return `false` as the default case.\n7. The examples show the expected output for each vehicle type.","status":200,"tokens":[209,336],"elapsed":6.362929583,"cost":0.005667,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8589,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
