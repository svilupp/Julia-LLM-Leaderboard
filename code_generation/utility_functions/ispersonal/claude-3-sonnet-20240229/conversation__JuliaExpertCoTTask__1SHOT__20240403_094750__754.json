All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Define concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Write the `ispersonal` function that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument.\n4. Inside the function, use `typeof` to check the type of the vehicle.\n5. If the vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, return `true`.\n6. If the vehicle is a `Bus` or `Truck`, return `false`.\n7. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, return `false` by default.\n8. Provide an example usage of the `ispersonal` function with a `Car` instance.\n\nThis implementation follows the given task and provides a concise solution using pattern matching and type unions.","status":200,"tokens":[209,343],"elapsed":6.522459666,"cost":0.005772,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16247,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
