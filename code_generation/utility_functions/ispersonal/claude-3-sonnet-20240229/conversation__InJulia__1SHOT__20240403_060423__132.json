We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to serve as the parent type for all vehicle types.\n2. We define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`, and `OtherVehicle` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. The `ispersonal` function takes a type parameter `T` that must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n4. Inside the `ispersonal` function, we use the `<:` operator to check if the given type `T` is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, we return `true` because these are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n5. If the given type `T` is a subtype of `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `false` because these are not considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n6. For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, including `OtherVehicle`, we return `false` by default.\n\nIn the example usage, we call the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types and print the results. The output shows that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles, while `Bus`, `Truck`, and `OtherVehicle` are not considered personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[104,564],"elapsed":11.442174209,"cost":0.008772,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29540,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
