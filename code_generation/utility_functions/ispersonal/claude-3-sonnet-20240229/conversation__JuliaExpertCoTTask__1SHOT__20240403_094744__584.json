We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that inherit from it.\n2. The `ispersonal` function takes an argument `v` of type `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Inside the function, we use the `isa` operator to check the type of `v`.\n4. If `v` is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, we return `true`.\n5. If `v` is a `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `false`.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we return `false` by default.\n7. We provide examples of using the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.\n\nThis solution follows the given task and works for the specified types. It also handles any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` by defaulting to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[209,381],"elapsed":6.58924825,"cost":0.006342,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18582,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
