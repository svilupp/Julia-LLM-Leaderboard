We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to represent all vehicle types.\n2. We define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. The `ispersonal` function is defined using multiple method signatures:\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})` return `true` because `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{Bus})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Truck})` return `false` because `Bus` and `Truck` are not considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n   - `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` is a catch-all method that returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` not explicitly handled by the previous methods.\n\n4. In the example usage, we test the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types as well as a non-vehicle type (`typeof(1)`) to demonstrate the behavior.\n\nThe key points to note are:\n\n- The `ispersonal` function takes a type parameter `::Type{T}` where `T` is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n- For each concrete vehicle type (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`), we define a separate method that returns the desired trait (`true` or `false`).\n- The catch-all method `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` handles all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `false` by default.\n\nThis approach allows you to easily extend the `ispersonal` function to handle additional vehicle types in the future by adding new method signatures for those types.","status":200,"tokens":[104,659],"elapsed":10.913782541,"cost":0.010197,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8126,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
