All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is defined with multiple method signatures to handle each subtype differently.\n\nFor `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, indicating that these are personal vehicles for everyday driving. For `Bus` and `Truck`, the function returns `false`, indicating that these are not personal vehicles.\n\nThe last method signature `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` serves as a catch-all for any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` that may be defined in the future. By default, it returns `false`, assuming that any new subtype is not a personal vehicle unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n\nThe examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the `ispersonal` function with the different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[141,420],"elapsed":7.882526375,"cost":0.006723,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28375,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
