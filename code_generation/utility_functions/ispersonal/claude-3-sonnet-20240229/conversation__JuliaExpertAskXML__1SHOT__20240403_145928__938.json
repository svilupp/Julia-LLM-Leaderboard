The `ispersonal` function uses multiple dispatch to return a trait (true or false) based on the type of vehicle passed to it. The first two method definitions return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the next two return `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and the final method returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe commented example at the end demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function for the defined vehicle types as well as a non-vehicle type (`typeof(1.0)`).","status":200,"tokens":[146,343],"elapsed":6.955692959,"cost":0.005583,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2439,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
