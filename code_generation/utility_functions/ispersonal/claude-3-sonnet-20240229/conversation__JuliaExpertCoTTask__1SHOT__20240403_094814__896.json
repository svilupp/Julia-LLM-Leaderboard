Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Write the function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n4. Inside the function, use multiple `isa` checks to determine the type of the input vehicle.\n5. Return `true` if the input is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` if it is of type `Bus` or `Truck`.\n6. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.\n7. Provide examples of using the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.\n\nThis solution follows the task requirements precisely and demonstrates the behavior of the `ispersonal` function for the given vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[209,372],"elapsed":7.618784416,"cost":0.006207,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19510,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
