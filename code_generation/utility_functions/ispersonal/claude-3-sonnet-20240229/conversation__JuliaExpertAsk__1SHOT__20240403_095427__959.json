The `ispersonal` function is defined using multiple method signatures, each taking a type as an argument.\n\nThe first two methods return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, indicating that they are personal vehicles for everyday driving. The next two methods return `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` types.\n\nThe last method signature uses a type parameter `<:AbstractVehicle` to catch any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `false` by default.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that `ispersonal` behaves as expected for the given types, as well as an arbitrary subtype `BigRig` of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,367],"elapsed":6.472955292,"cost":0.005928,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31494,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
