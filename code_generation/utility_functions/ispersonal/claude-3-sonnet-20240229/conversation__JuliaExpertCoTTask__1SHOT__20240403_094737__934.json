We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and its concrete subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n\n2. The `ispersonal` function is defined as a method that takes a type parameter `T` as input.\n\n3. For the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true` as they are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\n4. For the types `Bus` and `Truck`, the function returns `false` as they are not considered personal vehicles.\n\n5. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false` by default.\n\n6. In the example, we call `ispersonal(Car)`, which invokes the method `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` and prints `true`.\n\nThis approach allows us to define the behavior of the `ispersonal` function for specific vehicle types and provide a default behavior for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[209,363],"elapsed":6.544683542,"cost":0.006072,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26408,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
