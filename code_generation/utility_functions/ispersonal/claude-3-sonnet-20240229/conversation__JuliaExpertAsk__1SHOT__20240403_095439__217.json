All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It uses the `where` clause to constrain the type parameter `T` to be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nInside the function, it checks if `T` is a subtype of `Union{Car, Motorcycle}`. If it is, it returns `true`, indicating that the vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. If `T` is a subtype of `Union{Bus, Truck}`, it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it also returns `false` by default.\n\nThe example at the end demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types. It prints `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,380],"elapsed":5.918415459,"cost":0.006123,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27661,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
