X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Defining functions\n   - Multiple dispatch using AbstractTypes and AbstractVehicle type\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing AbstractTrees, AbstractAlgebras\n\nAbstractVehicle <: AbstractTree\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n  ispersonal = false\n  \n  @dispatch function ispersonal(::Car) end\n  @dispatch function ispersonal(::Motorcycle) end\n  @dispatch function ispersonal() end\n\n  ispersonal(vehicle)\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n  return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n  return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal()\n  return false\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `ispersonal` function should now correctly identify personal vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) by returning `true`, while other types of AbstractVehicle will default to `false`. Note, this assumes you have defined Car and Motorcycle as subtypes of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[411,283],"elapsed":10.865672208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
