All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function is then defined with multiple methods, one for each subtype. The method for `AbstractVehicle` returns `false` by default, and the methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle` return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[200,207],"elapsed":2.575858209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":86954460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
