The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if it is, otherwise it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[200,210],"elapsed":1.567881125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":116500748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
