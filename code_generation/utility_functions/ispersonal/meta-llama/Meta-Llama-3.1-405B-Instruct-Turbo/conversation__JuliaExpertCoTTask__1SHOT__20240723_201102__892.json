All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if so, and `false` otherwise. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior for each subtype.","status":200,"tokens":[200,226],"elapsed":3.827765334,"cost":0.00439,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1681802017,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
