All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: Union{Car, Motorcycle} = true\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle = false\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # false\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an `AbstractVehicle` type and four concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function uses multiple dispatch to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, and `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior for each type.","status":200,"tokens":[138,210],"elapsed":3.98579075,"cost":0.00384,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1587875128,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
