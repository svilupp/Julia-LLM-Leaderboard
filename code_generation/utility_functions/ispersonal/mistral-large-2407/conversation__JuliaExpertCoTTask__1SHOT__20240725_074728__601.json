All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we will implement the `ispersonal` function that checks if a given vehicle type is a personal vehicle.\n\nHere are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Define the `AbstractVehicle` type and its subtypes.\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function.\n3. Provide an example to demonstrate the function.\n\nLet's start by defining the types and the function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))       # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # Should return false\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define AbstractVehicle and its subtypes**:\n   - `AbstractVehicle` is an abstract type that serves as the base type for all vehicle types.\n   - `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\n2. **Implement the `ispersonal` function**:\n   - The function takes a parameter `vehicle` of type `AbstractVehicle`.\n   - It checks if the `vehicle` is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if it is.\n   - For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false`.\n\n3. **Example usage**:\n   - We create instances of `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` and call the `ispersonal` function on them.\n   - The function should return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`.\n\nThis code should correctly implement the required functionality and demonstrate the expected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[215,541],"elapsed":11.289129125,"cost":0.005514,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1149188420,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
