All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and its subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the vehicle and returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for `Bus`, `Truck`, or any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Provide an example to demonstrate the function's usage.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the vehicle types\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Implement the ispersonal function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    elseif isa(vehicle, Bus) || isa(vehicle, Truck)\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 3: Provide examples\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # Should return false\n\n# Checking with an unknown type\nstruct Bicycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nprintln(ispersonal(Bicycle()))     # Should return false\n```\n\nNow, let's check that our solution is correct by running the code. Each call to `ispersonal` should return the expected output based on the type of vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[195,340],"elapsed":3.441385375,"cost":0.00023325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1940826490,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
