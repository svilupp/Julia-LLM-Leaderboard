All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Define subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. Implement the function `ispersonal` that checks if the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving based on its type.\n4. Test the function with an example.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the abstract type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Define the subtypes\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 3: Implement the function ispersonal\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 4: Example\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # should return false\n```\n\nNow let's check that the solution works correctly by running the provided examples along with some assertions.\n\n```julia\n# Check examples\n@assert ispersonal(Car()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Bus()) == false\n@assert ispersonal(Truck()) == false\n\nprintln(\"All tests passed!\")\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation, and all tests confirm that the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[195,345],"elapsed":4.132034625,"cost":0.00023625,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1603511100,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
