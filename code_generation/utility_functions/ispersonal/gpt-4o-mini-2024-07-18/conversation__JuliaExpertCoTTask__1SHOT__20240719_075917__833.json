All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define the `AbstractVehicle` abstract type and its subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Implement the `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the vehicle and returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Provide an example to demonstrate the function.\n\nNow, I will implement the code.\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the abstract type and its subtypes\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Implementing the ispersonal function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 3: Providing an example\nexample_vehicle = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(example_vehicle))  # This should print true\n\n# Test with other types\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))          # This should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))        # This should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))   # This should print true\n```\n\nNow, I will check that the solution is correct by running the provided examples and verifying the output.
