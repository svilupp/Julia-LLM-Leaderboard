All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It will return `true` for these types and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\n4. **Test the Function** - We'll provide an example of calling `ispersonal` with a `Car` instance.\n\nHere's how the code looks:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the Abstract Base Type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Define Specific Vehicle Types\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 3: Implement ispersional function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 4: Test the Function\n# Example\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # Should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # Should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # Should print false\n```\n\n### Checking the Solution\n- Calling `ispersonal(Car())` returns `true`.\n- Calling `ispersonal(Motorcycle())` returns `true`.\n- Calling `ispersonal(Bus())` returns `false`.\n- Calling `ispersonal(Truck())` returns `false`.\n\nThe solution works as intended and meets the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[195,399],"elapsed":4.595303708,"cost":0.00026865,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1089688595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
