All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can accomplish this by defining the `ispersonal` function that checks the type of the vehicle and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.
