All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The output shows that the function correctly identifies the personal vehicles as `true` and the non-personal vehicles as `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":18.847077542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":27796,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
