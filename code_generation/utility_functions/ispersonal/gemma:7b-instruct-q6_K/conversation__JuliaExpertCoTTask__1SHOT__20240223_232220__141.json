Then, I defined subtypes for various vehicles, such as `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. \n2. **Write functions and code:** I wrote the `ispersonal` function that takes an instance of `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, or `false` otherwise. I used the `isa` operator to check if the vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`.\n3. **Solve the task:** The function works correctly for the specified types and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n4. **Check the solution:** I provided an example usage of the `ispersonal` function to demonstrate its functionality. The output matches the expected results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":22.535790333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":5437,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
