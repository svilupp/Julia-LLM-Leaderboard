All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

The function `ispersonal` is called with each vehicle as an argument. The function returns `true` for the `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for the `Bus` and `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":19.2040855,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":3777,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
