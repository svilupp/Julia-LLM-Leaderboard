All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We'll implement a function that returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other unlisted subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    vehicle_type = typeof(vehicle)\n    if vehicle_type == Car || vehicle_type == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # false\n```\n\nSteps:\n1. Declare `AbstractVehicle` as an abstract type to represent all vehicles.\n2. Define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3.
