All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we will implement the function `ispersonal` that checks if a given subtype is a personal vehicle. Following are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Define the concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Implement the function `ispersonal` to return true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` and false for others.\n4. Provide an example to demonstrate the function's usage.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the abstract type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Define subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 3: Implement the function ispersonal\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\n# Step 4: Example usage\n# Provide an example of using the ispersonal function with a Car\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Expected output: true\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- `ispersonal` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` returns `true` because they are considered personal vehicles.\n- `ispersonal` defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This includes `Bus`, `Truck`, or any other types that might be defined later.","status":200,"tokens":[195,358],"elapsed":4.075718291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1988982976,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
