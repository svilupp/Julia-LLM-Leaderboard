All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use Julia's multiple dispatch and traits feature. We'll define a trait `PersonalVehicleTrait` and implement it for the specified vehicle types.
