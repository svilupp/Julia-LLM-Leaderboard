[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Recalling the required Julia snippets\n  2. Solving the task\n  3. Double-checking the solution\n\n### 1\\. Recalling the required Julia snippets\n\nWe will need the following snippets:\n\n- `abstract type`: Define an abstract type that serves as a supertype of other types.\n- `abstract subtype`: Define a subtype of an abstract type.\n- `typealias`: Define a type alias.\n- `function`: Define a function.\n- `return`: Return a value from a function.\n\n### 2\\. Solving the task\n\nWe will define an `AbstractVehicle` type and subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then we will define the `ispersonal` function that takes a `Vehicle` as input and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`.
