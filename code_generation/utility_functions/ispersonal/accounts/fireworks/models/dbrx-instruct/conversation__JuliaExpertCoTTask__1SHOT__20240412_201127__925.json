All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Define a function `ispersonal` that takes a single argument `vehicle` of type `AbstractVehicle`.\n   - Create a list of personal vehicles: `personal_vehicles = (Car, Motorcycle)`.\n   - Check if the type of the input `vehicle` is in the list of personal vehicles using the `isa` function. If it is, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.\n\n2.
