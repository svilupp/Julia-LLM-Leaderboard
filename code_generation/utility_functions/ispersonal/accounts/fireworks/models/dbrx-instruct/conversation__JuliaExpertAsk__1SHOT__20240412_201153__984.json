All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example of how you could define the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n```\nIn this example, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function is defined with methods for each of these concrete types, returning `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[136,200],"elapsed":3.361269625,"cost":0.0005376,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1017833379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
