All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to represent all vehicles.\n2. We define concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. We define a function `ispersonal` that takes a type as an argument (`::Type{T}`).\n4. We define specific methods for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` to return `true` or `false` accordingly.\n5. We define a default method for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` to return `false`.\n6. We test the function with the provided types.","status":200,"tokens":[199,308],"elapsed":2.54587225,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-281158960,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
