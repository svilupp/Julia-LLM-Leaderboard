[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

We use multiple dispatch to define separate implementations for each subtype.\n* For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, we return `true`. For `Bus` and `Truck`, we return `false`.\n* We define a default case for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` using a where clause. This ensures that the function will return `false` for any unknown subtype.\n* Finally, we provide an example usage of the `ispersonal` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the type of vehicle is determined by the type of the object, rather than by a specific property of the object. If the type of vehicle is determined by a property, a different approach would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[359,434],"elapsed":3.860245083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1692885252,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
