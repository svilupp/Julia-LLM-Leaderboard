All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle = begin\n    T isa Union{Type{Car},TYPE{Motorcycle}}\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```\nIn this implementation, the `ispersonal` function uses the `where` clause to restrict the input to subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. It then uses the `Union` type to match the provided type with either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` for these types and defaulting to `false` for all other subtypes.","status":200,"tokens":[137,192],"elapsed":8.481137417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1784935983,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
