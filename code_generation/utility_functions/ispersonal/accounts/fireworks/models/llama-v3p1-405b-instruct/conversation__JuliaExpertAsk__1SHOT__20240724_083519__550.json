All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

To ensure soundness, other abstract vehicles default to false. A custom example (Train is not a personal vehicle and will default to false as expected) is also given to demonstrate the behavior for other subtypes of `AbstractVehicles`.","status":200,"tokens":[137,508],"elapsed":14.639639834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1870373752,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
