All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\n# Define the abstract type and subtypes\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the `ispersonal` function\nfunction ispersonal(::Union{Car, Motorcycle})\n    return true\nend\nfunction ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```\nLet me walk you through my thought process:\n\n1.  First, we define the AbstractVehicle type. We then create subtypes such as Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck.\n2.  We define the `ispersonal` function with a method for the specific types we know are personal vehicles i.e, Car and Motorcycle. We return true in this function when input is of type Car or Motorcycle.\n3.  We define another method for the generic `ispersonal` function which takes any AbstractVehicle type and returns false. This ensures any other subtype of AbstractVehicle would default to returning false when `ispersonal` function is called.\n4.  Finally, we test our function with several instances of the various subtypes of vehicles to confirm that it behaves as desired.\n\nWith that, I confirmed that the function is correct.
