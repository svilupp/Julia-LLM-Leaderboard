All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, I think through my approach step by step:\n\n1. Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. Create subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. Write a function `ispersonal` that takes a type as an argument and returns `true` if the type is a personal vehicle and `false` otherwise.\n\nNext, I write the functions and code I need:\n```julia\n# Define the abstract type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Create subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Write the function\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}} = true\n\n# Now, we need to create a promotion step for when the type input is not a Type but an instance\nispersonal(t) = ispersonal(typeof(t))\n```\n\nTo solve the task and test my solution is correct, I create an example.
