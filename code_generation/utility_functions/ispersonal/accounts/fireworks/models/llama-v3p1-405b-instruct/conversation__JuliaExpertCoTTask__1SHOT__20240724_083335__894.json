The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we create a function `ispersonal` that takes a type as an input and returns `true` if the vehicle is for personal everyday use and `false` otherwise. \n\nWe need to find a way to identify personal vehicles. One possible way to do this is by assigning a constant which represents if a vehicle is personal or not.\n\n#### Step 2: Write any functions and other code needed\n\nFirst, we define the `AbstractVehicle` and its subtypes.\n\n```julia\n# Create Abstract Type with Subtypes\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define constant that determines if a type is of personal vehicle\nconst personalVehicles = [Car, Motorcycle]\n```\n\nNext, we create a function that checks whether a type has `true` for the constant `personalVehicles`.\n\n```julia\n# Create function to determine if provide vehicle is personal\nfunction ispersonal(type::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    if in(type, personalVehicles)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nWe can further simplify `ispersonal` to\n\n```julia\n# Create function to determine if provide vehicle is personal\nispersonal(type::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = in(type, personalVehicles)\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nFinally, we can solve the task\n\n```julia\n# Determine if Car() is personal\nresult = ispersonal(Car())\nprint(\"Is car a personal vehicle?\\n\", result)\n```\n\nThe answer should print `true`.\n\n### Example\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())\nispersonal(Motorcycle())\nispersonal(Bus())\nispersonal(Truck())\n```\n\nshould return `true` for the first two calls, and `false` for the last two.","status":200,"tokens":[199,447],"elapsed":15.453882459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":452079176,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
