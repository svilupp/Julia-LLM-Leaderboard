All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. The `Bus` and `Truck` structs do not inherit from `PersonalVehicle`, so their instances are correctly handled by the fallback implementation of `ispersonal`. \n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\ntrue\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[199,269],"elapsed":1.077551792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":566088306,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
