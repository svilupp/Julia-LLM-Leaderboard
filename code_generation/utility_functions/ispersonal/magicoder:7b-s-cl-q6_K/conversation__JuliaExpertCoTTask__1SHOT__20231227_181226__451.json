The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we define the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal(vehicle)` is generic over any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\nInside the function, we use pattern matching to check the type of `vehicle` using the `isa` operator. We return `true` if `vehicle` is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` if it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`. If `vehicle` doesn't match any of these types, we return `false`.\n\nThe example given in the problem description: \n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[227,339],"elapsed":18.552406292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
