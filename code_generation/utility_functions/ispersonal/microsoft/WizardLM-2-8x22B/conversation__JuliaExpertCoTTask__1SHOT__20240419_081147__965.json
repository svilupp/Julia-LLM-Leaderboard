The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It also defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that may be defined in the future.","status":200,"tokens":[220,553],"elapsed":29.123080416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":804072235,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
