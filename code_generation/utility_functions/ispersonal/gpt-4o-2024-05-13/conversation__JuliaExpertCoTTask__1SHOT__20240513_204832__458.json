Define the subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. Write the function `ispersonal` that distinguishes between personal and non-personal vehicles.\n\nHere is the code implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define the abstract type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define specific vehicle types\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the ispersonal function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Default fallback method for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nfunction ispersonal(::Any)\n    return false\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))        # should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))        # should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))      # should print false\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define the abstract type**: `AbstractVehicle` is the parent type for all vehicle types.\n2. **Define specific vehicle types**: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. **Implement the `ispersonal` function**:\n   - This function checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If so, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n   - A fallback method ensures any other type also returns `false`.\n\nFinally, we test the function with sample vehicle instances to ensure correct output.","status":200,"tokens":[195,366],"elapsed":3.508745583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1210004700,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
