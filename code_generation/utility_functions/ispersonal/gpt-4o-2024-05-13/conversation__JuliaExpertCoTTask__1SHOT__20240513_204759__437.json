All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other subtypes, the function should default to `false`.\n\n### Step 3: Create Example and Verify\nWe'll create an instance of `Car` and check if `ispersonal(Car())` returns `true`.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the Type Hierarchy\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Implement the `ispersonal` Function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 3: Create Example and Verify\n# Example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))          # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))   # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))          # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))        # Should return false\n\n# Example with a default case\nstruct Bicycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nprintln(ispersonal(Bicycle()))      # Should return false\n```\n\nThis implementation adheres to the given task and verifies the correctness with examples.","status":200,"tokens":[195,366],"elapsed":3.754407416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1468352455,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
