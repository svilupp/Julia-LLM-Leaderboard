All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` as the base type for all vehicles.\n2. Define subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that inherit from `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Implement the `ispersonal` function that takes a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype.\n\nCode:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in [Car, Motorcycle]\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # Output: false\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The abstract type `AbstractVehicle` is defined as the base type for all vehicles.\n- The subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are defined as structs that inherit from `AbstractVehicle`.\n- The `ispersonal` function takes a parameter `vehicle` of type `T`, where `T` is constrained to be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n- Inside the function, we check if the type `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` using the `in` operator. If it is, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nThis solution ensures that the `ispersonal` function works for the specified vehicle types (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`) and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[209,502],"elapsed":20.487784667,"cost":0.040784999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12095,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
