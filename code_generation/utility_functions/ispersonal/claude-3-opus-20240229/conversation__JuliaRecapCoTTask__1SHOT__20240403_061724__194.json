[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Motorcycle}) = true\n\n# Example\nispersonal(Car) # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle) # true \nispersonal(Bus) # false\nispersonal(Truck) # false\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Defined an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` that all vehicle types inherit from\n- Defined concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck` that subtype `AbstractVehicle`\n- Defined the `ispersonal` function with multiple dispatch based on the type passed in\n  - The base method accepts any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `false`\n  - Specific methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle` return `true`\n- Using `::Type{<:AbstractType}` allows matching on the type itself rather than an instance\n  - So we can call `ispersonal(Car)` directly with the type\n\nThis leverages multiple dispatch to concisely handle the logic for different vehicle types. Any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` will fall back to returning `false` unless an explicit method is added.\n\nThe example shows it returns the expected `true`/`false` for the 4 required types.
