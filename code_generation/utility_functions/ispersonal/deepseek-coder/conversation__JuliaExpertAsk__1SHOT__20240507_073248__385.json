All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `ispersonal` that checks if a given vehicle is a personal vehicle or not. Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle))  # false\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes a type parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle or not. The function is overloaded for each concrete type of `AbstractVehicle`. The default case returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[152,363],"elapsed":16.298902792,"cost":0.00012292000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":756415830,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
