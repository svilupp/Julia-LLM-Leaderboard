The function is overloaded for each subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, with `Car` and `Motorcycle` returning `true` and `Bus` and `Truck` returning `false`. The default behavior for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is to return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[152,335],"elapsed":14.970585834,"cost":0.00011508,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-939248222,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
