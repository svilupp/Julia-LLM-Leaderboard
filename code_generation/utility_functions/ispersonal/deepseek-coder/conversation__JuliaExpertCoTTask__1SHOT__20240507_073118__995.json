All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia code that defines the `AbstractVehicle` type, the `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` types, and the `ispersonal` function.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(vehicle::Car) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle) = true\n```\n\nThe `ispersonal` function is defined for each subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`, and for `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`.
