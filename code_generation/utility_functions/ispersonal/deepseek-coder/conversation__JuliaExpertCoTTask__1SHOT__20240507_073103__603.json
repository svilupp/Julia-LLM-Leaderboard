All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia code that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(vehicle::Car) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle) = true\n\n# Testing\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Should return false\n```\n\nIn this code, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then define a function `ispersonal` that returns `false` by default for any `AbstractVehicle`. We override this function for `Car` and `Motorcycle` to return `true`.\n\nThe `ispersonal` function is dispatched on the type of the argument, so it will call the appropriate method based on the runtime type of the argument. This is an example of multiple dispatch in Julia.\n\nThe last four lines of the code are tests to verify that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[226,321],"elapsed":11.98616525,"cost":0.00012152,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":811016256,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
