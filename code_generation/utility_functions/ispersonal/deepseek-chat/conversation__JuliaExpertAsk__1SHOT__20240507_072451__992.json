The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the vehicle and returns `true` if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[136,308],"elapsed":19.768312458,"cost":0.00010528,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":909127184,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
