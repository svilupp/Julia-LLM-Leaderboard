All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the input `vehicle` and returns `true` if it is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. The function also handles the case where the input is not one of the four specified types by defaulting to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[208,306],"elapsed":17.805864291,"cost":0.00011480000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-992292047,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
