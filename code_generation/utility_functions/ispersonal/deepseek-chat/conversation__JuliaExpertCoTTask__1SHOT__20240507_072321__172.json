The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the `vehicle` argument and returns `true` if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. The `isa` function is used to check if the `vehicle` is an instance of a specific type.","status":200,"tokens":[208,281],"elapsed":17.468559458,"cost":0.0001078,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":137507151,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
