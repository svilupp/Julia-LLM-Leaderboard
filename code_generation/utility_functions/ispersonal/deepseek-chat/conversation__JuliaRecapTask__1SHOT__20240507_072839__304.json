[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function returns `false` by default for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. However, we also define specific behavior for the types `Car` and `Motorcycle` (returning `true`) and for the types `Bus` and `Truck` (returning `false`).\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Int)\nfalse\n```\n\nIn the first two calls, we pass the types `Car` and `Bus` to the `ispersonal` function, and it correctly returns `true` for `Car` and `false` for `Bus`. In the last call, we pass the type `Int`, which is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, so the function returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[384,374],"elapsed":22.468542666,"cost":0.00015848000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-115894333,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
