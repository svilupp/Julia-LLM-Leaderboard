The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the provided `vehicle` and returns `true` if it's a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. The example usage demonstrates the function with instances of each type.","status":200,"tokens":[208,292],"elapsed":18.319843833,"cost":0.00011088000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":563538469,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
