The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the vehicle and returns `true` if it's a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. The function defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[136,259],"elapsed":14.853504166,"cost":9.156e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1804241551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
