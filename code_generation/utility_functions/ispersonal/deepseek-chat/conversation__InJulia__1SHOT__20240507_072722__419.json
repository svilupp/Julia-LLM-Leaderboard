All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a function `ispersonal` that checks if a given Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}})\n    return true\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))       # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))      # false\n```\n\nIn this code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes a type parameter that must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The first implementation of `ispersonal` returns `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that is not explicitly handled. The second implementation of `ispersonal` is specialized for the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, returning `true` for these types.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types and prints the results.","status":200,"tokens":[97,284],"elapsed":21.019616584,"cost":9.310000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1028367056,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
