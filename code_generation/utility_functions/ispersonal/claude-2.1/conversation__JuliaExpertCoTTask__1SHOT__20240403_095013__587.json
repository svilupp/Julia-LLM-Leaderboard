All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the input vehicle `v` is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` if so since those are personal vehicles. Otherwise it returns `false`. \n\nAn example call with `Car()` demonstrates it returning `true` for a personal vehicle type.\n\nThe function works for all the required input types and defaults to `false` for any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype not explicitly handled.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[207,244],"elapsed":9.535579792,"cost":0.007512,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5585,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
