All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function definition and an example usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractVehicle\n    if T <: Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\nispersonal(Car) # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle) # returns true \nispersonal(Bus) # returns false\nispersonal(Truck) # returns false\nispersonal(Train) # returns false by default\n```\n\nThe function takes in a concrete vehicle type T as input, checks if it is a subtype of either Car or Motorcycle using the <: operator, and returns true if so. Otherwise it returns false by default. I demonstrate calling it on several vehicle types, where Car and Motorcycle return true, while Bus, Truck and other types return false.","status":200,"tokens":[99,190],"elapsed":8.218856917,"cost":0.005352,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5548,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
