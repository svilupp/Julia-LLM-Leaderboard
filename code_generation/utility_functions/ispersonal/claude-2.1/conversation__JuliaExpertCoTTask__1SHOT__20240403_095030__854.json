The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the passed vehicle object is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` if so. Otherwise it checks if it is a `Bus` or `Truck`, returning `false` in that case. For any other vehicle type it defaults to `false`.\n\nAn example call with `Car()` shows it returning `true` as expected.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[207,251],"elapsed":8.504815791,"cost":0.007679999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13691,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
