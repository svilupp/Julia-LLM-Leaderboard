It checks for `Car` and `Motorcycle` specifically to return `true`, checks for `Bus` and `Truck` specifically to return `false`, and defaults to `false` for any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype.\n\nAn example call is shown for each vehicle type, demonstrating that it correctly identifies cars and motorcycles as personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[99,277],"elapsed":14.036785208,"cost":0.00744,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27588,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
