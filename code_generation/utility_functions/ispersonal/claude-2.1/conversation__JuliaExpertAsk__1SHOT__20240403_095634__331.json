The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It returns `false` for `Bus` or `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype.\n\nThe example calls demonstrate it working for the different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[137,233],"elapsed":8.723041459,"cost":0.0066879999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31922,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
