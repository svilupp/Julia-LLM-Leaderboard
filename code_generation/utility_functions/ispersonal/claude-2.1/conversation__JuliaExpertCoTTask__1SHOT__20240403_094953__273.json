All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end \nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if v isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Union{Bus, Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\nispersonal(Car()) # returns true\n```\n\nThis defines an abstract vehicle type and some concrete vehicle types. The `ispersonal` function checks if the input vehicle `v` is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` if so. Otherwise it checks if it is a `Bus` or `Truck`, returning `false` in that case. For any other vehicle type it defaults to `false`.\n\nAn example call with `Car()` is shown, which returns `true` as expected.\n\nThe key aspects are:\n- Define needed types\n- Check input type with `isa` and return appropriate boolean\n- Default to `false`\n- Show example usage\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[207,267],"elapsed":11.702081959,"cost":0.008064,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31525,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
