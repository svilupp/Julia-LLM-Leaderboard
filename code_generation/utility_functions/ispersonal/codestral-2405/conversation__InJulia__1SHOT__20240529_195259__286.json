All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmy_car = Car()\nmy_bus = Bus()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(my_car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(my_bus))  # Outputs: false\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_car` is a `Car`, so `ispersonal(my_car)` returns `true`. `my_bus` is a `Bus`, so `ispersonal(my_bus)` returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[100,304],"elapsed":2.145464125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":638301366,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
