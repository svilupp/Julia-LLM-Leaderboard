Here's how you could define the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `isa` function to check if the provided vehicle is an instance of either the `Car` or `Motorcycle` types. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nmy_car = Car()\nmy_truck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(my_car))  # Outputs: true\nprintln(ispersonal(my_truck))  # Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,241],"elapsed":1.796098167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-507549433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
