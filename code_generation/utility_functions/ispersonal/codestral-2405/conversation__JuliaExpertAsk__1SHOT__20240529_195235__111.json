This function leverages Julia's type dispatch system to efficiently handle different vehicle types, returning `true` for personal vehicles and `false` for non-personal vehicles. If the vehicle type is not explicitly handled, the function defaults to `false`, ensuring correct behavior for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,263],"elapsed":1.865526167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":37888115,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
