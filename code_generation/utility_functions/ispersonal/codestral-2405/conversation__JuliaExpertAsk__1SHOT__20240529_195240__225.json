It uses the `isa` function to check if the vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[141,252],"elapsed":1.82295875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":615604725,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
