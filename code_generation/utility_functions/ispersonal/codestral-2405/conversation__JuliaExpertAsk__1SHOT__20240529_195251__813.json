If it is, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it will return `false`, as per the default case specified in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[141,205],"elapsed":1.503268292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2028510882,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
