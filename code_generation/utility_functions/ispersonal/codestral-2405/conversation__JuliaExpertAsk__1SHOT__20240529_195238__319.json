The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

However, it is specifically defined to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types. This allows us to correctly identify personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[141,206],"elapsed":1.494931208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1959286621,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
