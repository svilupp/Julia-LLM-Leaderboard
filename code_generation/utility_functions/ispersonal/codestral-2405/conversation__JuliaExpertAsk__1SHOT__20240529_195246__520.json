The `isa` function is used to check if the vehicle is of the specified types. If the vehicle is not a `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, or `Truck`, the function will default to `false` as per the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[141,232],"elapsed":1.744113375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":708729449,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
