The `ispersonal` function takes a vehicle object as input and checks if it's an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` if so, and `false` otherwise. The `@show` macro is used to display the output of the function calls for `Car()`, `Motorcycle()`, `Bus()`, and `Truck()`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,253],"elapsed":1.826135667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1530732842,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
