All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we create the `ispersonal` function that checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, returning `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. In the example, we call `ispersonal` with a `Car` object, which returns `true` as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[215,210],"elapsed":1.532077041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-46117803,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
