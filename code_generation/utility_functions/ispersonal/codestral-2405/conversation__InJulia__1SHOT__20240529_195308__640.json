All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If the `vehicle` is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nIn the example, we create instances of `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`, and call the `ispersonal` function on each of them to demonstrate its behavior.\n\nIt should be noted that the `isa` function works with union types in Julia, so `vehicle isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}` can be used to check if a variable is an instance of any of the specified types.","status":200,"tokens":[100,330],"elapsed":2.298854916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":718989937,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
