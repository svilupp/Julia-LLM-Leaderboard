For any other `AbstractVehicle` subtype, the function defaults to `false`. This approach enables extensibility, as adding new vehicle types just requires defining their behavior in the `ispersonal` function.","status":200,"tokens":[141,234],"elapsed":1.680428583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1365492438,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
