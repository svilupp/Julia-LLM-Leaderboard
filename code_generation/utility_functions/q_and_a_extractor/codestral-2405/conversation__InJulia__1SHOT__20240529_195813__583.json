Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if !isempty(question)\n                push!(questions, strip(question))\n                question = \"\"\n            end\n            question = line[length(\"# Question\"):end]\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            if !isempty(answer)\n                push!(answers, strip(answer))\n                answer = \"\"\n            end\n            answer = line[length(\"# Answer\"):end]\n        else\n            question = strip(question) * \"\\n\" * line\n            answer = strip(answer) * \"\\n\" * line\n        end\n    end\n    push!(questions, strip(question))\n    push!(answers, strip(answer))\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown text. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it saves the rest of the line as the current question. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it saves the rest of the line as the current answer. If the line does not start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it appends the line to the current question and answer. The function then returns a tuple of all the extracted questions and answers. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[95,359],"elapsed":2.528868208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-820022069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
