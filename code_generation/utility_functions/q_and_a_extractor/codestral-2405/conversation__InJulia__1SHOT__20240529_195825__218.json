Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes the markdown-formatted text (`md`) as input.\n2. It initializes an empty string `question` to store the extracted question and an empty string `answer` to store the extracted answer.\n3. It sets a flag `is_question` to keep track of whether the current section is a question or an answer.\n4. It splits the markdown text into lines and iterates through each line.\n5. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `is_question` to `true`, clears the `question` string, and appends the remaining text from the line to the `question` string.\n6. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `is_question` to `false`, clears the `answer` string, and appends the remaining text from the line to the `answer` string.\n7. If a line doesn't start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it appends the text from the line to the `question` or `answer` string, depending on the value of `is_question`.\n8. After extracting all the questions and answers, the function returns a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` strings, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[95,315],"elapsed":2.198642959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":574043886,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
