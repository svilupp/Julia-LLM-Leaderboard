[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple way to do it in Julia using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Match\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)\", md)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s*(.+)\", md)\n\n    if question_match === nothing || answer_match === nothing\n        return (\"No question found\", \"No answer found\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1], [' ', '\\n'])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1], [' ', '\\n'])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will search for the text \"# Question\" followed by any characters (lazily, to stop at the first occurrence of \"# Answer\" or the end of the string), and then it will do the same for \"# Answer\". It will then strip any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines from the extracted text. If it can't find a question or answer, it will return \"No question found\" or \"No answer found\", respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[95,281],"elapsed":1.934308709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1087480574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
