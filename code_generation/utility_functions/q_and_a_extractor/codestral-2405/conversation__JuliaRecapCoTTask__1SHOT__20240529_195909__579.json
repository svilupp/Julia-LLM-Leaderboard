[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    section = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = \"answer\"\n        elseif section == \"question\"\n            question = strip(question * line * \"\\n\")\n        elseif section == \"answer\"\n            answer = strip(answer * line * \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines and then iterates over them. It changes the current section if it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If the current section is `question`, it appends the current line to the `question` string. Similarly, if the current section is `answer`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string. At the end, it returns a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input string is well-formatted and that each section starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` followed by a space. It also assumes that the `question` and `answer` sections are not empty.\n\nThis function can be improved to handle errors and edge cases more gracefully. For example, it could check that the input string is not empty and that it contains both a `question` and an `answer` section. It could also handle cases where the `question` or `answer` section is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[404,373],"elapsed":2.648492875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":115849784,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
