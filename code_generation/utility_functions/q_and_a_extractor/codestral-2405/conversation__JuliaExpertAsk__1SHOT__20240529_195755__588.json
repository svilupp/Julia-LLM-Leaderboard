It then iterates over the parsed document, checking for header elements with level 1. When it finds a header with text \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it sets the question or answer variable to the text of the next element in the document. The strip function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,251],"elapsed":1.831054125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1665405134,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
