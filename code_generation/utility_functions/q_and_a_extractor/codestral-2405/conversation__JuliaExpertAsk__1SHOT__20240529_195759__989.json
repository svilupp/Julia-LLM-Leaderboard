If the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it switches the mode to either \"question\" or \"answer\". Then, it appends the line (after stripping any leading or trailing spaces) to the corresponding string. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[136,269],"elapsed":1.894971667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1410437415,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
