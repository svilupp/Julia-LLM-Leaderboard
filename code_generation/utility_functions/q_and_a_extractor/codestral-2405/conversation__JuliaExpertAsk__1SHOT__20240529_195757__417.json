It changes the `mode` variable to `:question` or `:answer` when it encounters a new `# Question` or `# Answer` section. It then appends each line to the `question` or `answer` variable depending on the current `mode`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[136,273],"elapsed":1.996245667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1175344587,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
