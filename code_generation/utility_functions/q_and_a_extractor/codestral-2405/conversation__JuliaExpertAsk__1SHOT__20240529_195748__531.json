Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `q_and_a_extractor` that does what you've asked for. It uses a regular expression to match the question and answer sections and then strips any leading spaces and newlines.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\n+(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)\", md, overlapped=true)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\n+(.+)\", md)\n\n    question = isnothing(question_match) ? \"\" : strip(question_match[1])\n    answer = isnothing(answer_match) ? \"\" : strip(answer_match[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `md` as input, which is assumed to be the markdown-formatted text. It uses the `match` function from Julia's `Regex` module to find the text in the question and answer sections. The regular expressions used are:\n\n- `r\"# Question\\n+(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)\"` to match the question section. This matches the string \"# Question\" followed by one or more newlines, then captures any following text until it encounters \"# Answer\" or the end of the string. The `?` after `.+` makes the match non-greedy, so it will stop at the first \"# Answer\" it encounters.\n- `r\"# Answer\\n+(.+)\"` to match the answer section. This matches the string \"# Answer\" followed by one or more newlines, then captures the rest of the string.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If no match is found for either the question or answer section, an empty string is returned for that section. The function then returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,438],"elapsed":3.071710333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1976703279,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
