Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you to create a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia. This function will parse the given markdown-formatted text `md` and return a tuple with the extracted question and answer. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = strip(replace(line, \"# Question\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))\n        elseif in_question\n            question = strip(question * \"\\n\" * line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer = strip(answer * \"\\n\" * line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your markdown-formatted text as an argument. It will return a tuple where the first element is the extracted question and the second element is the extracted answer. The function will strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[95,319],"elapsed":2.273171,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1874726627,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
