It maintains a `section` variable to keep track of whether it's currently in the question or answer section. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it switches the current section. Otherwise, it appends the stripped line to the appropriate section's string. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer strings, after stripping any leading or trailing newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[136,255],"elapsed":1.827077167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1552828095,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
