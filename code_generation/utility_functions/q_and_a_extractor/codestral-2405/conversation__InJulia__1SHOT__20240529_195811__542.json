Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple solution using Julia's Regex and Match objects. This function will return a Vector of tuples, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    results = Tuple{String, String}[]\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|\\Z)\"s\n    for m in eachmatch(question_pattern, md)\n        question = strip(m.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(m.captures[2])\n        push!(results, (question, answer))\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression pattern that matches a `# Question` header, followed by any text (lazy matching), then a `# Answer` header, and then any text until the next `# Question` header or the end of the string. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function is used to find all matches of this pattern in the input string `md`, and for each match, the question and answer are extracted and added to the `results` Vector as a tuple.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `results` Vector, which contains a tuple for each question and answer in the input string.","status":200,"tokens":[95,325],"elapsed":2.226524583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":56450207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
