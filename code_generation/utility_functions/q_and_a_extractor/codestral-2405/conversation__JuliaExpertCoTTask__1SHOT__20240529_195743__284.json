It uses regular expressions to match the text in the Question and Answer sections, strips any leading or trailing spaces and newlines, and returns a tuple containing the question and answer. If the input string does not contain both a Question and Answer section, the function throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[237,276],"elapsed":2.031232708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":772136910,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
