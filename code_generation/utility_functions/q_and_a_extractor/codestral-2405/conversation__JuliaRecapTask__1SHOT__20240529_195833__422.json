[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

This function will extract all text in the markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. It will then return the answer in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\n1. Initialize variables to store the question and answer.\n2. Split the markdown text into lines.\n3. Iterate through each line.\n4. If the line starts with `# Question`, store the remaining text as the question and continue to the next line.\n5. If the line starts with `# Answer`, store the remaining text as the answer and continue to the next line.\n6. If the line does not start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, append the text to the current question or answer, depending on which one was last encountered.\n7.
