It then extracts the text for each section, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the question and answer as a tuple. If the question or answer sections are not found in the markdown text, the function will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[136,218],"elapsed":1.530158375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":555841817,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
