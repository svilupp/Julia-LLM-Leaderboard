[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(replace(line, \"# Question\" => \"\"))\n            in_question, in_answer = true, false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))\n            in_question, in_answer = false, true\n        elseif in_question\n            question = strip(question) * \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer = strip(answer) * \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution defines the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a string `md` as input. It initializes two empty strings for `question` and `answer`, and two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is part of the question or answer section.\n\nThe function then iterates through each line of the input markdown string. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `question` to the rest of the line and sets `in_question` to true. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `answer` to the rest of the line and sets `in_answer` to true. If the current line is part of the question or answer section, it appends the line to the respective string.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[402,415],"elapsed":2.929958584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1320051064,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
