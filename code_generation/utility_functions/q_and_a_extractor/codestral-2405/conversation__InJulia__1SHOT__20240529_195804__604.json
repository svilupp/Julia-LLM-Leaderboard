[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to find the questions and answers and the `split` function to extract the text. This function assumes that each question is followed by its answer and that there is no other text between questions and answers.\n\n```julia\nusing Match\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = eachmatch(r\"# Question\\n(.+?)\\n# Answer\\n\", md)\n    return [(strip(m.captures[1]), strip(split(md[m.end:end], \"\\n# Question\")[1])) for m in questions]\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a list of tuples, each tuple containing a question and its corresponding answer. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may not handle some edge cases. For example, it assumes that the markdown sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\" are always capitalized and that they are always followed by a newline. It also assumes that the input string `md` is well-formatted and that each question is followed by its answer.\n\nIf you're dealing with more complex or unpredictable markdown text, you may need a more sophisticated approach, potentially involving a markdown parser.","status":200,"tokens":[95,295],"elapsed":2.028082,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":909330756,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
