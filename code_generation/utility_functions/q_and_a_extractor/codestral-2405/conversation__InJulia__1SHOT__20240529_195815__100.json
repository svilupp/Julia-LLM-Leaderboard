[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question, answer = (\"\", \"\")\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(replace(line, \"# Question\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines, then checking each line to see if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it removes the \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" part and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The question and answer are then returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[95,220],"elapsed":1.620806375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2139420406,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
