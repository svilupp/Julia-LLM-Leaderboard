If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false, then it strips the line of the `# Question` prefix and assigns the result to `question`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it switches the flags and assigns the line to `answer`. If the current line is not a section header, it appends the line to the current section if it's not empty. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,343],"elapsed":2.469945291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":388543714,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
