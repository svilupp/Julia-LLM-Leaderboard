When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it begins storing any subsequent lines into the `question` variable, until it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, at which point it switches to storing lines into the `answer` variable. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the question and answer.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question is followed by exactly one answer, and that the question and answer sections are not nested within other sections. If that's not the case, you may need to modify this function to suit your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[95,367],"elapsed":2.541193708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":457803449,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
