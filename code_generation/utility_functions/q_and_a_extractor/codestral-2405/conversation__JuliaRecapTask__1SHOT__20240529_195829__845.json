[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The function iterates over each line of the text and checks if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, it sets the mode to 1 or 2 respectively and extracts the text after the header. If not, it appends the line to the current question or answer based on the mode. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text. The `replace` function is used to remove the header from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[402,336],"elapsed":2.368625792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1807188740,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
