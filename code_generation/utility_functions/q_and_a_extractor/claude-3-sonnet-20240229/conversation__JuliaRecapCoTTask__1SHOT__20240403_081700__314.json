[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = \"# Question\"\n    answer_start = \"# Answer\"\n\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        stripped = strip(line)\n\n        if startswith(stripped, question_start)\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(stripped, answer_start)\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \" \" * stripped\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \" \" * stripped\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We start by defining the strings `question_start` and `answer_start` that denote the start of a question and answer section, respectively.\n2. We initialize flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track if we're currently inside a question or answer section.\n3. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. We loop over each line in the input markdown `md` using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n5. For each line, we strip leading/trailing whitespace with `strip(line)`.\n6. If the stripped line starts with `question_start`, we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and reset `question` to an empty string.\n7. If the stripped line starts with `answer_start`, we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and reset `answer` to an empty string.\n8. If we're inside a question section (`in_question` is `true`), we append the stripped line to `question` with a space separator.\n9. If we're inside an answer section (`in_answer` is `true`), we append the stripped line to `answer` with a space separator.\n10. Finally, we return a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where we strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nThis function assumes that the question and answer sections are properly formatted with the specified headings (`# Question` and `# Answer`), and that there is at most one question and one answer section in the input markdown. If there are multiple questions or answers, it will only extract the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[380,612],"elapsed":10.030488541,"cost":0.010320000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22833,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
