The regular expression pattern `r\"(# Question\\n?)(.*?)(# Answer\\n?)(.*?)(?=\\n*\\s*#|\\Z)\"m` captures the following:\n   - `(# Question\\n?)`: Matches the string \"# Question\" followed by an optional newline character.\n   - `(.*?)`: Captures the question text in a non-greedy way.\n   - `(# Answer\\n?)`: Matches the string \"# Answer\" followed by an optional newline character.\n   - `(.*?)`: Captures the answer text in a non-greedy way.\n   - `(?=\\n*\\s*#|\\Z)`: Positive lookahead to ensure the match stops at the next heading or end of string.\n   - `m`: Enables multiline mode for the regular expression.\n\n2. `eachmatch` is used to find all matches of the pattern in the input markdown text `md`.\n\n3. An empty tuple `q_and_a` is initialized to store the extracted question-answer pairs.\n\n4. For each match `m`, the captured question and answer texts are extracted using `m.captures[2]` and `m.captures[4]`, respectively. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespace or newlines.\n\n5. The extracted question-answer pair is added to the `q_and_a` tuple using `push!`.\n\n6. Finally, the `q_and_a` tuple containing all extracted question-answer pairs is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown sections for questions and answers are formatted correctly, with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers. It will extract all such sections from the input text.","status":200,"tokens":[134,571],"elapsed":11.273319292,"cost":0.008967,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
