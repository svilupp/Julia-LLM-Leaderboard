Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function to extract the question and answer from a given markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    state = :init\n    q = a = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :answer\n        else\n            if state == :question\n                q *= strip(line)\n            elseif state == :answer\n                a *= strip(line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return q, a\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a state machine to parse the input text. It starts in the `:init` state and transitions to `:question` when it encounters a line starting with `# Question`. It then appends subsequent lines (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace) to the `q` string until it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, at which point it transitions to the `:answer` state and starts appending lines to the `a` string.\n\nThe function returns a tuple `(q, a)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[223,372],"elapsed":6.316220917,"cost":0.006249,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6897,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
