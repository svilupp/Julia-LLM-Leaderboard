[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts text from markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` and returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with leading/trailing whitespace removed:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*(#\\s*Answer|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=\\s*#|\\z)\"\n\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md, PCRE.DOTALL)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md, PCRE.DOTALL)\n\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define two regular expression patterns:\n   - `question_pattern` matches the text after `# Question` up until the next `# Answer` or end of string.\n   - `answer_pattern` matches the text after `# Answer` up until the next section header or end of string.\n2. We use the `match` function to find the matches in the input string `md` for both patterns, using the `PCRE.DOTALL` flag to make the dot (`.`) match newlines as well.\n3. If a match is found, we extract the captured text using `captures[1]`. If no match is found, we assign an empty string `\"\"`.\n4. We use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n5. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted and cleaned-up text.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown sections for Question and Answer are present and correctly formatted. If there are multiple occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer`, it will return the first match for each.","status":200,"tokens":[380,477],"elapsed":11.008234084,"cost":0.008295,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
