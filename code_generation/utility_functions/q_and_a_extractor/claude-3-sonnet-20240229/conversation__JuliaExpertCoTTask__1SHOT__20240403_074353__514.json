Define regular expression patterns for matching questions and answers.\n2. Use `match` function to find the first match of the question and answer patterns in the input text.\n3. If either the question or answer match is not found, return `nothing`.\n4. Otherwise, extract the captured text for the question and answer, strip any leading/trailing whitespace, and return them as a tuple.\n\nThe regular expressions use the `\\s*` pattern to match any leading/trailing whitespace, and the `.*?` pattern to match the text non-greedily until the next `#` or end of string. The `DOTALL` option is used to make the `.` match newlines as well.","status":200,"tokens":[223,432],"elapsed":8.081238583,"cost":0.007149000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13761,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
