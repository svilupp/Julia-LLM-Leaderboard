[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        line = strip(line)\n        if !isempty(line)\n            if line == \"# Question\"\n                in_question = true\n                in_answer = false\n                question = \"\"\n            elseif line == \"# Answer\"\n                in_question = false\n                in_answer = true\n                answer = \"\"\n            elseif in_question\n                question *= strip(line, ['#', ' ']) * \" \"\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= strip(line, ['#', ' ']) * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We initialize two empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n2. We also initialize two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently inside a Question or Answer section.\n3. We split the input markdown text `md` by newlines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n4. We iterate over each line of the split text using a `for` loop.\n5. We first strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the current line using `strip(line)`.\n6. If the line is not empty, we check its content:\n    - If it's `\"# Question\"`, we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and reset `question` to an empty string.\n    - If it's `\"# Answer\"`, we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and reset `answer` to an empty string.\n    - If we are inside a Question section (`in_question` is `true`), we strip any leading `#` or spaces from the line using `strip(line, ['#', ' '])` and append it to `question` with a space separator.\n    - If we are inside an Answer section (`in_answer` is `true`), we strip any leading `#` or spaces from the line using `strip(line, ['#', ' '])` and append it to `answer` with a space separator.\n7. Finally, we return a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))` containing the extracted question and answer strings with any leading/trailing whitespace removed.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,698],"elapsed":13.60132575,"cost":0.011607,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12206,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
