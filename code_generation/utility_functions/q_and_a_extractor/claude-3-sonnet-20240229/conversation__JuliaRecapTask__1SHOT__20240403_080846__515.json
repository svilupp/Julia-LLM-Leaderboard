[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from a given markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes two empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer, respectively.\n4. It uses two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether it's currently extracting the question or the answer.\n5. It iterates through each line of the markdown text.\n6. If the line starts with `\"# Question\"` (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace), it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n7. If the line starts with `\"# Answer\"` (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace), it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n8. If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line (excluding leading/trailing whitespace) to the `question` string, separated by a space.\n9. If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line (excluding leading/trailing whitespace) to the `answer` string, separated by a space.\n10. After iterating through all lines, it returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where `strip` is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Heading\n\nSome text\n\n# Question\n    What is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,651],"elapsed":10.913108833,"cost":0.010902000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14727,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
