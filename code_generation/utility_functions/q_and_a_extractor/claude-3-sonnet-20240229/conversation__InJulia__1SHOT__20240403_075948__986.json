The markdown text `md` is split into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. The function initializes empty strings `question` and `answer`, and boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of the current section.\n3. The function iterates over each line in the markdown text.\n4. If the line starts with \"# Question\" (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace), the `in_question` flag is set to `true`, and the `in_answer` flag is set to `false`.\n5. If the line starts with \"# Answer\" (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace), the `in_question` flag is set to `false`, and the `in_answer` flag is set to `true`.\n6. If the `in_question` flag is `true`, the stripped line (with leading/trailing whitespace removed) is concatenated to the `question` string, separated by a space.\n7. If the `in_answer` flag is `true`, the stripped line is concatenated to the `answer` string, separated by a space.\n8. After iterating through all lines, the function returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where `strip` removes any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer strings.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some random text\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Some more random text\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,654],"elapsed":11.105511666,"cost":0.010086000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8410,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
