Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n?(.*?)\\n(?=# Answer|#|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n?(.*?)\\n(?=# |#|$)\"\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    if question_match === nothing || answer_match === nothing\n        return nothing\n    else\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections from the input markdown string. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text following `# Question` until it encounters either `# Answer`, another header (`#`), or the end of the string.\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text following `# Answer` until it encounters another header (`#`) or the end of the string.\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first occurrence of the patterns in the input string.\n4. If either the question or answer match is `nothing` (not found), the function returns `nothing`.\n5. Otherwise, the captured text from the regex matches is extracted using the `.captures` field and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.\n6. The stripped question and answer texts are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNote that this assumes the markdown sections are formatted correctly with `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. If there are multiple occurrences of these headers, it will only extract the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[134,405],"elapsed":9.346718375,"cost":0.006477,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16285,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
