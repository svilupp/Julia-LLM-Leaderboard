Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=(#|$))\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=(#|$))\"\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md, PCRE.DOTALL)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md, PCRE.DOTALL)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer text from the input markdown string `md`. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Define the regular expression patterns for Question and Answer sections:\n   - `question_pattern`: Matches the text after `# Question` until the next `#` or end of string.\n   - `answer_pattern`: Matches the text after `# Answer` until the next `#` or end of string.\n\n2. Use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of each pattern in the input string. The `PCRE.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` to match newline characters.\n\n3. Extract the captured text from the matches using `captures[1]` and strip leading/trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n\n4. Return a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted text.\n\nTo test:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n# Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe solution assumes that there is only one Question and one Answer section in the input markdown string. If there are multiple sections, it will extract only the first occurrence of each.","status":200,"tokens":[223,463],"elapsed":8.244202583,"cost":0.007614,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13193,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
