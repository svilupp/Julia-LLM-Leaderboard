Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` and `answer_pattern` are regular expressions that match the sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", respectively. The `(.*?)` captures the text following the header until the next header or the end of the string.\n\n2. The `match` function is used to find the first match of the patterns in the input string `md`. The `MULTILINE=true` option allows the `.` to match newline characters.\n\n3. If a match is found, the captured text is extracted using `match.captures[1]`. If no match is found, an empty string is assigned.\n\n4. The `strip` function removes any leading/trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the extracted text.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted and stripped question and answer texts.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is at most one \"# Question\" and one \"# Answer\" section in the input markdown text. If there are multiple sections, it will only extract the first occurrence of each.","status":200,"tokens":[134,422],"elapsed":9.501613542,"cost":0.006732,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-58,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
