Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = answer = \"\"\n    state = :seeking_question\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            state = :reading_question\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            state = :reading_answer\n        else\n            if state == :reading_question\n                question *= strip(line, [' ', '\\n'])\n            elseif state == :reading_answer\n                answer *= strip(line, [' ', '\\n'])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize `question` and `answer` as empty strings.\n2. `state` tracks whether we're seeking a question, reading a question, or reading an answer.\n3. Split the input text `md` into lines.\n4. For each line:\n    - If the line starts with `\"# Question\"`, set `state` to `:reading_question`.\n    - If the line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, set `state` to `:reading_answer`.\n    - Otherwise, if `state` is `:reading_question`, append the stripped line to `question`.\n    - Otherwise, if `state` is `:reading_answer`, append the stripped line to `answer`.\n5. Return a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[223,424],"elapsed":6.618513875,"cost":0.0070290000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30520,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
