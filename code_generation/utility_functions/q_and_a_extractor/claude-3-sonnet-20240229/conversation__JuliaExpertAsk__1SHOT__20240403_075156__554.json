The `INLINE=true` option enables the `.captures` field to return the matched text instead of just the offsets.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` matches the text after `# Question` until the next blank line or another header.\n2. The `answer_pattern` matches the text after `# Answer` until the next blank line or another header.\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first occurrence of the patterns in the input text.\n4. The captured text from the matches is extracted using `.captures[1]`.\n5. The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the captured text.\n6. The `something` function returns the captured text if it exists, or an empty string if it's `nothing`.\n7. The extracted question and answer strings are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can call this function like:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[129,493],"elapsed":8.493508625,"cost":0.007782000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19401,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
