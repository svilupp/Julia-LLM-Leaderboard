[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in the markdown text `md`.\n2. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer texts.\n3. We use two booleans `in_question` and `in_answer` to track if we are currently extracting the question or answer text based on the section headers.\n4. We loop through each line of the markdown text `md` using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n5. For each line, we check if it starts with the section header `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"` using `startswith(strip(line), ...)`. `strip(line)` trims any leading/trailing whitespace.\n6. If it's a `\"# Question\"` header, we set `in_question=true`, `in_answer=false` and continue to the next line.\n7. If it's a `\"# Answer\"` header, we set `in_question=false`, `in_answer=true` and continue.\n8. If we are in the question section (`in_question=true`), we append the trimmed line (removing any leading/trailing spaces, newlines, carriage returns) to the `question` string with `\" \"` as a separator.\n9. If we are in the answer section (`in_answer=true`), we append the trimmed line to the `answer` string with `\" \"` as a separator.\n10. Finally, we return a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))` where we remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nThis function handles multiline questions and answers by appending each line to the respective string until the next section header is encountered.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Tracking section headers using booleans `in_question` and `in_answer`.\n- Stripping whitespace and newlines from lines before appending to the question/answer strings.\n- Returning a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted texts.","status":200,"tokens":[380,665],"elapsed":14.18057375,"cost":0.011115,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7538,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
