The `question_regex` matches the text after \"# Question\" until the next \"# Answer\", \"# Question\", or the end of the string.\n2. The `answer_regex` matches the text after \"# Answer\" until the next \"# Question\" or the end of the string.\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first match of these regular expressions in the input string `md`.\n4. The captured text (if any) is extracted using `match.captures[1]`.\n5. The `something` function is used to handle the case where no match is found, returning an empty string instead of `nothing`.\n6. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespace or newlines.\n7. The stripped question and answer texts are returned as a tuple.\n\nNote that this assumes that there is at most one \"Question\" and one \"Answer\" section in the input string. If you need to handle multiple questions and answers, you may need to modify the regular expressions and use something like `eachmatch` to iterate over all matches.","status":200,"tokens":[134,493],"elapsed":9.934753208,"cost":0.007797,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21810,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
