Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns a tuple with the extracted texts:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question_start = findfirst(line -> startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\"), lines)\n    answer_start = findfirst(line -> startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\"), lines)\n\n    if isnothing(question_start) || isnothing(answer_start)\n        return nothing\n    end\n\n    question_end = answer_start - 1\n    answer_end = findfirst(isempty, lines[answer_start+1:end]) === nothing ?\n                 length(lines) :\n                 answer_start + findfirst(isempty, lines[answer_start+1:end]) - 1\n\n    question = strip(join(lines[question_start+1:question_end], \" \"), ' ')\n    answer = strip(join(lines[answer_start+1:answer_end], \" \"), ' ')\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a string `md` which represents the markdown-formatted text.\n2. The `split` function is used to split the text into lines using the newline character `\\n`.\n3. The `findfirst` function is used to find the indices of the lines starting with `\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"`.\n4. If either of the question or answer sections is not found, the function returns `nothing`.\n5. The end index of the question section is calculated as the line before the start of the answer section.\n6. The end index of the answer section is calculated as either the last line of the input text or the first empty line after the start of the answer section.\n7. The `join` function is used to concatenate the lines between the start and end indices of the question and answer sections, respectively. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters.\n8. The extracted question and answer texts are returned as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question section.\nIt can span multiple lines.\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer section.\nIt can also span multiple lines.\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nQuestion: This is a question section. It can span multiple lines.\nAnswer: This is the answer section. It can also span multiple lines.\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one question-answer pair in the input text. If you need to handle multiple question-answer pairs, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[92,671],"elapsed":12.800852833,"cost":0.010341000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19852,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
