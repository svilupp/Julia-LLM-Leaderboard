Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=#\\s*Answer|#\\s*Question|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=#\\s*Question|$)\"\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md, PCRE_MULTILINE=true)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md, PCRE_MULTILINE=true)\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to match the question and answer text in the markdown. \n\n1. `question_pattern` matches the section starting with `# Question` and captures the text until the next section heading or the end of the input.\n\n2. `answer_pattern` matches the section starting with `# Answer` and captures the text until the next section heading or the end of the input.\n\nThe `strip` function is applied to remove leading/trailing whitespace from the captured text.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that there is only one question-answer pair in the input markdown. If there are multiple pairs, you may need to modify the regular expressions or use a more sophisticated parsing approach.","status":200,"tokens":[134,340],"elapsed":6.506495709,"cost":0.005502,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15928,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
