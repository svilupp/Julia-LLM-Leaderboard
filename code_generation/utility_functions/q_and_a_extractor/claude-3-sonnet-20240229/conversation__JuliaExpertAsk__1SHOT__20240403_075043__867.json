Here's how it works:\n\n1. It initializes empty vectors `questions` and `answers` to store the extracted questions and answers.\n2. It initializes boolean flags `question_mode` and `answer_mode` to keep track of the current mode (question or answer).\n3. It initializes strings `current_question` and `current_answer` to store the currently processed question and answer.\n4. It iterates over each line of the input markdown text.\n5. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it appends the previously processed question and answer to their respective vectors `questions` and `answers`, and initializes `current_question` with the text after \"# Question\" and resets `current_answer`. It also sets `question_mode` to `true` and `answer_mode` to `false`.\n6. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `answer_mode` to `true` and `question_mode` to `false`.\n7. If `question_mode` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to `current_question`.\n8. If `answer_mode` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to `current_answer`.\n9. After processing all lines, it appends the last `current_question` and `current_answer` to their respective vectors.\n10. Finally, it zips the `questions` and `answers` vectors into a tuple of tuples using the `tuple` function and returns the result.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters from the input lines.","status":200,"tokens":[129,687],"elapsed":11.487292625,"cost":0.010692,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5601,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
