[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    qpattern = r\"# Question(.+?)(?=(#\\s*Answer|#\\s*Question|\\Z))\"m\n    apattern = r\"# Answer(.+?)(?=(#\\s*Question|\\Z))\"m\n\n    questions = collect(eachmatch(qpattern, md))\n    answers = collect(eachmatch(apattern, md))\n\n    isempty(questions) || isempty(answers) && return (\"\", \"\")\n\n    q = strip(replace(questions[1].match, r\"^# Question\" => \"\"))\n    a = strip(replace(answers[1].match, r\"^# Answer\" => \"\"))\n\n    return (q, a)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define regular expression patterns `qpattern` and `apattern` to match the question and answer sections, respectively. The patterns capture the text after `# Question` or `# Answer` until the next section header or end of string.\n\n2. We use `eachmatch` to find all matches of these patterns in the input markdown text `md`.\n\n3. If no questions or answers are found, we return an empty tuple `(\"\", \"\")`.\n\n4. Otherwise, we extract the first matched question and answer using `questions[1].match` and `answers[1].match`.\n\n5. We `strip` any leading/trailing whitespace and remove the `# Question` or `# Answer` prefix using `replace`.\n\n6. Finally, we return the tuple `(q, a)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis function assumes there is at most one question and one answer section in the markdown text. If there are multiple sections, it will return the first ones found.\n\nThe input `md` is expected to be an `AbstractString`. The output is a tuple `(q, a)` where `q` and `a` are strings containing the extracted question and answer text, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[380,490],"elapsed":9.951096625,"cost":0.00849,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12787,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
