The `question_pattern` matches the text starting with `# Question` followed by any whitespace and a newline `\\s*\\n?`. It then captures the text `(.*?)` until the next `# Answer` or another `#` or the end of the string `\\Z`. The `m` flag makes the `.` match newlines as well.\n\n2. The `answer_pattern` matches the text starting with `# Answer` followed by any whitespace and a newline `\\s*\\n?`. It then captures the text `(.*?)` until the next `# Question` or another `#` or the end of the string `\\Z`. The `m` flag makes the `.` match newlines, and the `s` flag makes the regex match across newlines.\n\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first match for each pattern in the markdown text.\n\n4. The captured groups are extracted using `match.captures[1]` and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace with the `strip` function.\n\n5. The stripped question and answer texts are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text has at most one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section. If there are multiple occurrences, it will only return the first match for each section.","status":200,"tokens":[129,463],"elapsed":9.221830833,"cost":0.007332,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32085,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
