The captured text is then extracted using `.captures[1]` and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.\n\nFinally, the tuple `(question, answer)` is returned with the extracted and cleaned question and answer text.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes there is exactly one question and one answer section in the input markdown string. If there are multiple occurrences, it will only extract the first instances of each.","status":200,"tokens":[129,329],"elapsed":7.573451125,"cost":0.005322,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14014,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
