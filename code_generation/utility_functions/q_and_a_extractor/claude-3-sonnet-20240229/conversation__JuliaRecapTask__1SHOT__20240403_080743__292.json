[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We define the strings `question_start` and `answer_start` to match the headers for the question and answer sections.\n2. We initialize two empty arrays `question_lines` and `answer_lines` to store the lines for the question and answer, respectively.\n3. We use two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the question or answer section.\n4. We loop through each line in the markdown text, splitting it by newlines.\n5. If the line starts with the question header, we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false` and continue to the next line.\n6. If the line starts with the answer header, we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true` and continue to the next line.\n7. If we are in the question section (`in_question`), we push the stripped line to `question_lines`.\n8. If we are in the answer section (`in_answer`), we push the stripped line to `answer_lines`.\n9. After processing all lines, we join the lines in `question_lines` and `answer_lines` into strings `question` and `answer`, respectively, separated by spaces.\n10. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function like:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some other text\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text has exactly one question and one answer section, and it will extract the first occurrence of each section. If there are multiple question or answer sections, it will only extract the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[379,742],"elapsed":13.979427292,"cost":0.012267,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5003,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
