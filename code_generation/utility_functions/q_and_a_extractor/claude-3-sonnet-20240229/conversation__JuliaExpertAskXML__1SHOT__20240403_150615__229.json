The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text after `# Question` up to the next `# Answer` or the end of the string.\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text after `# Answer` up to the next `# Question` or the end of the string.\n3. The `match` function is used to find the matches for the two patterns in the input string `md`.\n4. The captured groups from the matches are accessed using `match.captures[1]`. The `something` function is used to provide a default value of an empty string in case no match is found.\n5. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the extracted text.\n6. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the largest ocean?\n\n# Answer\nThe largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[134,529],"elapsed":9.238147583,"cost":0.008336999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6622,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
