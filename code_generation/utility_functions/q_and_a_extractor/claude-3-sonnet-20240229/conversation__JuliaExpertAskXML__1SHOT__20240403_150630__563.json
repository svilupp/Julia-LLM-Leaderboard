Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n?(.*?)\\n(?=# Answer|#|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n?(.*?)\\n(?=# |$)\"\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to extract the text between the markdown headers `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text following `# Question` until it encounters either `# Answer`, another markdown header (`#`), or the end of the string.\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text following `# Answer` until it encounters another markdown header (`#`) or the end of the string.\n3. The `match` function from the `Base.PCRE` module is used to find the first match of each pattern in the input string.\n4. The captured text is extracted from the `MatchData` objects using the `captures` field, and the leading/trailing whitespace is removed using the `strip` function.\n5. The stripped question and answer texts are returned as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown text contains only one instance of `# Question` and `# Answer`. If there are multiple occurrences, it will return the first match for each pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[134,369],"elapsed":8.17564675,"cost":0.005937,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28098,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
