[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The input `md` is split into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Two empty strings `question` and `answer` are initialized to store the extracted question and answer.\n3. Two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` are used to keep track of whether we're currently processing the question or the answer section.\n4. We loop through each line in the markdown text.\n5. If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n6. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n7. If `in_question` is `true`, we append the stripped line (removing leading/trailing spaces) to the `question` string, followed by a space.\n8. If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the stripped line to the `answer` string, followed by a space.\n9. After processing all lines, the function returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where any leading or trailing spaces are removed from the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,587],"elapsed":11.035211166,"cost":0.009942,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5268,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
