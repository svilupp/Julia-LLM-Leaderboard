When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    state = :init\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :answer\n        else\n            if state == :question\n                question *= strip(line)\n            elseif state == :answer\n                answer *= strip(line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a state machine to parse the markdown text. It iterates through each line of the text and checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, it updates the state accordingly. Otherwise, it appends the line to the current question or answer string, stripping leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThe function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[223,341],"elapsed":6.396956625,"cost":0.005784,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23457,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
