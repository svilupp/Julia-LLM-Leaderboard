It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n2. It uses two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether it's currently extracting text for the question or the answer section.\n3. It iterates over each line in the input string `md`, splitting it by newlines.\n4. If the line is `\"# Question\"`, it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n5. If the line is `\"# Answer\"`, it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n6. If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line (without leading/trailing spaces) to the `question` string, separated by a space.\n7. If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `answer` string, separated by a space.\n8. Finally, it returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, stripping any leading/trailing spaces from the extracted text.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that there is only one question-answer pair in the input text. If you need to handle multiple question-answer pairs, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[129,467],"elapsed":8.46764175,"cost":0.007392,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32662,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
