Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text starting with `# Question`, followed by any number of whitespace characters (`\\s*`), then captures the text up to the next `# ` or the end of the string (`.*?`). The `m` modifier makes the pattern match across multiple lines.\n\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text starting with `# Answer`, followed by any number of whitespace characters (`\\s*`), then captures the text up to the next `# ` or the end of the string (`.*?`). The `m` modifier makes the pattern match across multiple lines, and the `s` modifier allows the `.` to match newline characters.\n\n3. The `match` function is used to search for the question and answer patterns in the input markdown text.\n\n4. If the `question_match` or `answer_match` is `nothing` (no match found), an empty string `\"\"` is assigned to the corresponding variable. Otherwise, the captured text is extracted using `captures[1]` and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is at most one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section in the input markdown text. If there are multiple occurrences, it will extract the first one it finds.","status":200,"tokens":[129,492],"elapsed":8.319427375,"cost":0.0077670000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2227,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
