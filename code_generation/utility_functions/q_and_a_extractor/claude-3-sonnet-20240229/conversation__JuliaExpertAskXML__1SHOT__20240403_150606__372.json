It uses `findfirst` to find the indices of the `# Question` and `# Answer` strings in the markdown text.\n2. If either `# Question` or `# Answer` is not found, it returns empty strings.\n3. It calculates the start and end indices of the question and answer sections, taking into account the length of the header strings (`# Question` and `# Answer`).\n4. It extracts the question and answer text using slicing and `strip` to remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n5. It returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers appear only once in the markdown text and are in the correct order. If your markdown text has a different structure, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[134,501],"elapsed":9.704591042,"cost":0.007917,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19022,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
