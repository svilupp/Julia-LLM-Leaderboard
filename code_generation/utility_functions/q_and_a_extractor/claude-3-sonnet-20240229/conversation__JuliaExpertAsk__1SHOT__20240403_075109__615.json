Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=(# Answer|#|$))\"m\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=(# Question|#|$))\"m\n\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    question = strip(something(question_match.captures[1], \"\"))\n    answer = strip(something(answer_match.captures[1], \"\"))\n\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer text from the provided markdown-formatted text. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text starting with `# Question` followed by any text until either `# Answer` or the end of the string. The `m` modifier enables multi-line mode, and the non-capturing group `(.*?)` captures the question text.\n\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text starting with `# Answer` followed by any text until either `# Question` or the end of the string. The `m` modifier enables multi-line mode, and the non-capturing group `(.*?)` captures the answer text.\n\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first occurrence of the patterns in the markdown text. If a match is found, the captured text is stored in the `captures` field of the `RegexMatch` object.\n\n4. The `something` function is used to safely access the captured text. If the capture is `nothing` (no match found), an empty string is returned instead.\n\n5. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, including newlines, from the captured question and answer text.\n\n6. Finally, the function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is at most one Question and Answer section in the provided markdown text. If there are multiple occurrences, it will only extract the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[129,484],"elapsed":10.301996291,"cost":0.007647,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13528,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
