[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that extracts question and answer texts from a markdown-formatted string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)((?=#\\s*Answer)|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#|$)\"\n\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    if question_match === nothing || answer_match === nothing\n        return nothing\n    else\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define two regular expression patterns:\n   - `question_pattern`: Matches the text starting with \"# Question\" and captures the text until either \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_pattern`: Matches the text starting with \"# Answer\" and captures the text until either another \"#\" or the end of the string.\n\n2. We use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of the patterns in the input markdown string `md`.\n\n3. If either the question or the answer match is not found, we return `nothing`.\n\n4. Otherwise, we extract the captured texts from the match objects using the `captures` field, strip any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip` function, and return them as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\n\nSome introductory text...\n\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\nThe meaning of life is 42.\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the meaning of life?\nAnswer: The meaning of life is 42.\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is only one question-answer pair in the markdown text. If you need to handle multiple pairs, you can modify the regular expressions and use a loop to extract all pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[380,532],"elapsed":10.466073166,"cost":0.009120000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2391,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
