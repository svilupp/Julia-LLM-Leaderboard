[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to extract question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*(#|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)\\s*(#|$)\"\n    \n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    if question_match === nothing || answer_match === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We define two regular expression patterns: `question_pattern` to match the question section, and `answer_pattern` to match the answer section.\n2. The `match` function from the standard `Regex` module is used to find the first occurrence of the question and answer patterns in the input markdown text `md`.\n3. If either the question or answer section is not found, the function returns an empty tuple `(\"\", \"\")`.\n4. If both sections are found, we extract the captured text using `captures[1]` and remove any leading/trailing whitespace with the `strip` function.\n5. The extracted question and answer texts are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `q_and_a_extractor(md)` with your markdown-formatted text `md`. For example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes the question and answer sections exist and appear only once in the input text. If your use case requires handling multiple occurrences or more complex patterns, you may need to modify the regular expressions and logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[380,514],"elapsed":9.763944833,"cost":0.00885,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12449,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
