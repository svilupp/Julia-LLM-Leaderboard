[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    is_question, is_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            is_question = true\n            is_answer = false\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            is_question = false\n            is_answer = true\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif is_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif is_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The function first splits the input string `md` into lines using the `split` function with the newline character `\\n` as the delimiter.\n2. It initializes two empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer texts.\n3. It also initializes two boolean flags `is_question` and `is_answer` to track whether the current line belongs to a question or an answer section.\n4. The function then iterates over each line in the `lines` array.\n5. If the line starts with `\"# Question\"` (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace), it sets `is_question` to `true`, `is_answer` to `false`, and resets `question` to an empty string.\n6. If the line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, it sets `is_question` to `false`, `is_answer` to `true`, and resets `answer` to an empty string.\n7. If `is_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line text to the `question` string, followed by a space.\n8. If `is_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line text to the `answer` string, followed by a space.\n9. Finally, after iterating over all lines, the function returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where the leading/trailing whitespace from the question and answer texts are stripped using the `strip` function.\n\nThis implementation assumes that there is exactly one question-answer pair in the input markdown text. If you need to handle multiple question-answer pairs, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[380,610],"elapsed":12.050269625,"cost":0.01029,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28899,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
