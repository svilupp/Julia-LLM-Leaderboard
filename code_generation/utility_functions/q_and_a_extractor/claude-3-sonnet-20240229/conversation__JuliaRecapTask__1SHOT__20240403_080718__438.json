[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer texts from a given markdown-formatted string `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(question), strip(answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It initializes two empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer texts, respectively.\n2. It also initializes two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line belongs to the question or answer section.\n3. It then iterates over each line of the input markdown string `md`.\n4. For each line, it checks if it starts with `\"# Question\"` or `\"# Answer\"` (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace). If so, it sets the corresponding `in_question` or `in_answer` flag to `true` and the other flag to `false`.\n5. If the `in_question` flag is `true`, it appends the current line (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace) to the `question` string, followed by a space.\n6. If the `in_answer` flag is `true`, it appends the current line (after stripping leading/trailing whitespace) to the `answer` string, followed by a space.\n7. After iterating over all lines, it returns a tuple `(strip(question), strip(answer))`, where `strip` is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown sections for Question and Answer are structured correctly, with each section starting with `# Question` or `# Answer` on a new line. If the input markdown is not formatted correctly, the function may not extract the question and answer texts accurately.","status":200,"tokens":[379,663],"elapsed":12.630803125,"cost":0.011082000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4071,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
