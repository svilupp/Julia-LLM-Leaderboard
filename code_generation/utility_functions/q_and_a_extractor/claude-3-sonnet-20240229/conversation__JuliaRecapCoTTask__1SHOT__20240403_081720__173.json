[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(?=#|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    \n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md, MULTILINE=true)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md, MULTILINE=true)\n    \n    question = strip(something(question_match.captures[1], \"\"))\n    answer = strip(something(answer_match.captures[1], \"\"))\n    \n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We define two regular expressions `question_pattern` and `answer_pattern` to capture the text between `# Question` and the next section/end of string, and `# Answer` and the next section/end of string, respectively.\n\n2. We use the `match` function with the `MULTILINE=true` option to allow the `.` in the regex to match newlines, so the patterns can span multiple lines.\n\n3. The `captures` from the `match` give us the text we want to extract. We use the `strip` function to remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\n4. The `something` function is used to provide a default value (`\"\"` empty string) in case the `match` doesn't find the pattern.\n\n5. Finally, we return the extracted `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text has at most one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section. If there are multiple occurrences, it will only extract the first one.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[380,400],"elapsed":9.416458958,"cost":0.0071400000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1766,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
