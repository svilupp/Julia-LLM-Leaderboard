Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. The `question_pattern` regular expression matches the text following the `# Question` header until the next header or the end of the text.\n2. The `answer_pattern` regular expression matches the text following the `# Answer` header until the next header or the end of the text.\n3. The `match` function is used to find the first match of the regular expressions in the input text.\n4. The captured groups from the matches are extracted using `captures[1]`.\n5. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace and newlines from the captured text.\n6. The question and answer strings are returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown-formatted text contains valid `# Question` and `# Answer` headers, and that these headers appear only once in the text. If the headers are missing or appear multiple times, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[129,364],"elapsed":7.425155833,"cost":0.005847000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22453,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
