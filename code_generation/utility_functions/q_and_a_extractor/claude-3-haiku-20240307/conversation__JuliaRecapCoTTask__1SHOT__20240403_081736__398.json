[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from the given markdown-formatted text `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The markdown text is split into individual lines using the `split` function.\n2. We initialize two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of the current section.\n3. We iterate through the lines and check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, we update the flags accordingly.\n4. If we are in the \"# Question\" section, we append the current line to the `question` variable. Similarly, if we are in the \"# Answer\" section, we append the current line to the `answer` variable.\n5. After the loop, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings using the `strip` function.\n6. Finally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nThe function should work with the given markdown-formatted text and return the question and answer as a tuple. If the markdown text does not contain the expected sections, the function will return empty strings for the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[380,481],"elapsed":4.817106583,"cost":0.00069625,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5208,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
