The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into lines using the `split` function.\n3. It initializes variables to store the question and answer, and flags to indicate whether we're currently collecting the question or answer.\n4. It iterates through the lines, checking if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it updates the collection flags accordingly.\n5. If we're collecting the question or answer, it appends the line to the corresponding string.\n6. After iterating through all the lines, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question and answer strings.\n7. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n    The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,568],"elapsed":5.05079275,"cost":0.000733,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2505,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
