This gives us a vector of strings, where the question and answer text are in the 2nd and 3rd elements, respectively.\n\nWe then strip any leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer text using the `strip` function, and return them as a tuple.\n\nLet's test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")\n# Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function correctly extracts the question and answer from the input text.","status":200,"tokens":[257,351],"elapsed":3.594028334,"cost":0.000503,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20199,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
