Find the start and end indices of the question and answer sections using `findfirst`, `findnext`, and string matching.\n2. Extract the text between the start and end indices, and use `strip` to remove leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n3. Return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown-formatted text follows the expected format, with the question and answer sections clearly demarcated by the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.","status":200,"tokens":[129,299],"elapsed":2.958431291,"cost":0.000406,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
