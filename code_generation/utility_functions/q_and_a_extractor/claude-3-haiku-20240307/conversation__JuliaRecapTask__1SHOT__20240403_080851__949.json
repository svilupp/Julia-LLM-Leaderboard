[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `md` string is split into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. We initialize two variables, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted text, and two boolean flags, `is_question` and `is_answer`, to keep track of the current section.\n3. We iterate through the lines and check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, we update the corresponding flag.\n4. If we're in a question or answer section, we append the current line to the respective variable, stripping any leading/trailing spaces or newlines.\n5. Finally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple, with any remaining leading/trailing spaces or newlines stripped.\n\nThis solution assumes that the markdown-formatted text is well-structured, with the question and answer sections clearly delimited by the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers. If the input text has a different structure, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[379,516],"elapsed":4.958858959,"cost":0.0007397500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25366,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
