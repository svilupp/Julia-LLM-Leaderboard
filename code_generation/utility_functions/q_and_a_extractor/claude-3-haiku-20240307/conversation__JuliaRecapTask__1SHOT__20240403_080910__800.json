[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into an array of lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Two variables `question` and `answer` are initialized to store the extracted question and answer.\n3. The function then iterates through the lines, checking if the current line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n4. If the current line is a question, the function extracts the question by joining the lines from the current line to the line before the next `# Answer` line, and strips any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n5. If the current line is an answer, the function extracts the answer by joining the lines from the current line to the line before the next `# Question` line, and strips any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n6. The function then updates the `i` variable to the index of the next `# Question` or `# Answer` line, depending on which one it found.\n7. Finally, the function returns a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  \nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question\n\nWhat is the largest ocean in the world?\n\n# Answer\n\nThe largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,693],"elapsed":5.960522209,"cost":0.000961,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4907,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
