[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the `q_and_a_extractor` function that extracts the question and answer from the given markdown-formatted text `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Flag to indicate if we're in the question or answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    # Iterate through the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Question\"\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Answer\"    \n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        # If we're in the question section, append the line to the question\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        # If we're in the answer section, append the line to the answer\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n\n1. Splitting the markdown-formatted text into lines.\n2. Iterating through the lines and checking if each line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n3. If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set the `in_question` flag to `true` and start appending the lines to the `question` variable.\n4. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set the `in_question` flag to `false` and the `in_answer` flag to `true`, and start appending the lines to the `answer` variable.\n5. After iterating through all the lines, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` variables and return them as a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a sample question.\n    \n# Answer\nThis is a sample answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: This is a sample question.\nAnswer: This is a sample answer.\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any special instructions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[380,627],"elapsed":5.615720333,"cost":0.0008787500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28740,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
