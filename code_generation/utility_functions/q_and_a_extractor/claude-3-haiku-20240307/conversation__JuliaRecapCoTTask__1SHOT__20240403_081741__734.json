[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Initialize variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n3. Iterate through the lines, checking if each line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n4. If a \"# Question\" line is found, extract the question by joining the lines from the next line until the next \"# Answer\" line is found.\n5. If a \"# Answer\" line is found, extract the answer by joining the lines from the next line until the next \"# Question\" line is found.\n6. Skip any lines that don't start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n7. Finally, return the question and answer in a tuple, with any leading spaces and newlines stripped using `strip()`.\n\nIf there are any Special Instructions provided, the function will prioritize them over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[380,548],"elapsed":4.82119975,"cost":0.0007800000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24153,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
