The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into individual lines using the `split` function.\n2. Two variables, `question` and `answer`, are initialized to store the extracted question and answer, respectively.\n3. Two boolean variables, `collecting_question` and `collecting_answer`, are used to track whether the function is currently collecting the question or the answer.\n4. The function iterates through the lines of the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with `# Question`, the `collecting_question` flag is set to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with `# Answer`, the `collecting_question` flag is set to `false`, and the `collecting_answer` flag is set to `true`.\n   - If the `collecting_question` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `question` variable.\n   - If the `collecting_answer` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `answer` variable.\n5. Finally, any leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the `question` and `answer` variables using the `strip` function, and the (question, answer) tuple is returned.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n  The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,599],"elapsed":4.999681709,"cost":0.0007717500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2223,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
