It splits the input text `md` into individual lines.\n2. It searches for the indices of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers in the lines.\n3. If both headers are found, it extracts the text between them (for the question) and the text after the \"# Answer\" header (for the answer).\n4. It returns the question and answer as a tuple, after stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n5. If either the \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" header is not found, it returns an empty tuple `(\"\", \"\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[129,368],"elapsed":3.3439935,"cost":0.0004922500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6286,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
