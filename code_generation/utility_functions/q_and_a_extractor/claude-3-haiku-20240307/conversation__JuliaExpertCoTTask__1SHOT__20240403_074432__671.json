Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Think through the approach step by step\n    # We need to find the indices of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers\n    # Then extract the text between those headers and return it as a tuple\n\n    # Find the indices of the headers\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = strip(md[question_start+length(\"# Question\"):answer_start-1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start+length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n\nprintln(q_and_a)  # Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1.
