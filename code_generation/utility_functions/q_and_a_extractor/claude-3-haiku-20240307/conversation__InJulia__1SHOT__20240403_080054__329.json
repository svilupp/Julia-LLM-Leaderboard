The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of the current state.\n4. It iterates through each line in the text:\n   - If the line starts with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `in_answer` to `true` and `in_question` to `false`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `question` variable, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `answer` variable, followed by a newline character.\n5. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n  The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\n\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,557],"elapsed":4.544261833,"cost":0.0007192500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16252,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
