The markdown text is split into individual lines using the `split()` function.\n2. Variables are initialized to store the question and answer, and two boolean flags (`in_question` and `in_answer`) are used to keep track of which section we're currently in.\n3. The function iterates through the lines of the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set the `in_question` flag to `true` and the `in_answer` flag to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set the `in_answer` flag to `true` and the `in_question` flag to `false`.\n   - If we're in a question section, we append the line to the `question` variable.\n   - If we're in an answer section, we append the line to the `answer` variable.\n4. After iterating through all the lines, we use the `strip()` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` variables.\n5. Finally, the function returns the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n  The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,671],"elapsed":5.960161209,"cost":0.0008617500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21732,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
