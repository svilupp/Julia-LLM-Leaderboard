[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from the given markdown-formatted text `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    extracting_question = false\n    extracting_answer = false\n\n    # Iterate through the lines and extract the question and answer\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            extracting_question = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            extracting_question = false\n            extracting_answer = true\n        elseif extracting_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif extracting_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into lines using the `split` function.\n2. Two variables `question` and `answer` are initialized to store the extracted text.\n3. Two boolean variables `extracting_question` and `extracting_answer` are used to keep track of whether we are currently extracting the question or the answer.\n4. The function iterates through the lines of the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `extracting_question` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `extracting_question` to `false` and `extracting_answer` to `true`.\n   - If `extracting_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `question` variable.\n   - If `extracting_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `answer` variable.\n5. Finally, the function returns the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nNote that the function uses the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nIf you have any special instructions, please provide them, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[380,519],"elapsed":4.869276125,"cost":0.00074375,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
