[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Two variables `question` and `answer` are initialized to store the extracted question and answer text.\n3. Two boolean flags `collecting_question` and `collecting_answer` are used to keep track of whether the current line is part of the question or answer section.\n4. The function iterates through the lines of the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", the `collecting_question` flag is set to `true`, and the `collecting_answer` flag is set to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", the `collecting_question` flag is set to `false`, and the `collecting_answer` flag is set to `true`.\n   - If the `collecting_question` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `question` variable.\n   - If the `collecting_answer` flag is `true`, the line is appended to the `answer` variable.\n5. After the loop, any leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the `question` and `answer` variables using `strip()`.\n6. The question and answer are returned as a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  This is the question.\n\n# Answer\n  This is the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: This is the question.\nAnswer: This is the answer.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,687],"elapsed":5.546370375,"cost":0.0009535,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1545,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
