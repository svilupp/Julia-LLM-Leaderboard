The `question` and `answer` variables are then extracted from the original `md` string, using the start and end indices found in the previous steps, and stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n5. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[129,452],"elapsed":4.1744075,"cost":0.0005972500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10918,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
