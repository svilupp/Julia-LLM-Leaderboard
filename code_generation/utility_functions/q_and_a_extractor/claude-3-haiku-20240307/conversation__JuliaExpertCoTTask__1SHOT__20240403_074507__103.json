We join these lines back into strings and use the `strip` function to remove any leading/trailing spaces or newlines.\n\n4. **Return the question and answer in a tuple**: Finally, we return the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nThe function handles the given data correctly and returns the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[223,473],"elapsed":4.648216709,"cost":0.0006470000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17813,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
