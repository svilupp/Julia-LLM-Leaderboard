[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the given task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find the indices of the Question and Answer sections\n    q_start = findnext(\"# Question\", md, 1)\n    q_end = findnext(\"# Answer\", md, q_start)\n    a_end = findnext(\"\\n\\n\", md, q_end)\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = strip(md[q_start+10:q_end-1])\n    answer = strip(md[q_end+8:a_end-1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We use the `findnext` function to find the starting and ending indices of the Question and Answer sections in the input markdown text `md`.\n2. The `q_start` variable stores the index of the start of the Question section (after the \"# Question\" string).\n3. The `q_end` variable stores the index of the start of the Answer section (after the \"# Answer\" string).\n4. The `a_end` variable stores the index of the end of the Answer section (the first empty line after the Answer section).\n5. We then extract the question and answer text using slicing, and use the `strip` function to remove any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n6. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThis solution should work for the given task and follows the guidelines provided in the Special Instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[379,350],"elapsed":3.51229625,"cost":0.00053225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22048,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
