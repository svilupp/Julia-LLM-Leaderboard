The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into individual lines using the `split()` function.\n3. It initializes variables `question`, `answer`, `in_question`, and `in_answer` to keep track of the current state.\n4. It iterates through the lines:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `question` variable.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `answer` variable.\n5. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple, with leading and trailing spaces and newlines removed using the `strip()` function.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n  The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,528],"elapsed":4.904146542,"cost":0.0006830000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25253,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
