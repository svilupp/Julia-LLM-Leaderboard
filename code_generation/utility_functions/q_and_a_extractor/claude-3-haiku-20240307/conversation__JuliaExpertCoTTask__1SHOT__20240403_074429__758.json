Think through the approach: We need to find the start and end of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, and extract the text between them.\n2. Write the necessary functions: `find_section` to find and extract the text for a given section.\n3. Solve the task: Use the `find_section` function to extract the question and answer.\n4. Check the solution: Test the function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[223,428],"elapsed":4.394195792,"cost":0.00059075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5953,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
