The function takes a `md` argument, which is a string containing the markdown-formatted text.\n2. The function splits the markdown text into individual lines using the `split` function.\n3. The function initializes two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer, respectively.\n4. The function also initializes two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is part of the question or answer section.\n5. The function then iterates through the lines of the markdown text:\n   - If the current line starts with `\"# Question\"`, the `in_question` variable is set to `true`.\n   - If the current line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, the `in_question` variable is set to `false`, and the `in_answer` variable is set to `true`.\n   - If the current line is part of the question section (i.e., `in_question` is `true`), the line is appended to the `question` variable, with any leading spaces or newlines stripped using the `strip` function.\n   - If the current line is part of the answer section (i.e., `in_answer` is `true`), the line is appended to the `answer` variable, with any leading spaces or newlines stripped using the `strip` function.\n6. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\n    The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,649],"elapsed":5.207706291,"cost":0.00083425,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11791,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
