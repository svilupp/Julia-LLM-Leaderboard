Find the start indices of the question and answer sections using `findfirst`.\n2. Extract the text between the start of the question section and the start of the answer section for the question.\n3. Extract the text after the start of the answer section for the answer.\n4. Use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n5. Return the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThe solution handles the given example correctly.
