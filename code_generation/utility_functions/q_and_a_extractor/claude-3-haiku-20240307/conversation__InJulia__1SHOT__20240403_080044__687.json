The `md` string is split into lines using the `split()` function.\n2. Variables `question`, `answer`, `is_question`, and `is_answer` are initialized to store the extracted question and answer, and to keep track of the current section.\n3. The function iterates through the lines:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `is_question` to `true` and `is_answer` to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `is_answer` to `true` and `is_question` to `false`.\n   - If we're in a question section, the line is appended to the `question` string.\n   - If we're in an answer section, the line is appended to the `answer` string.\n4. After iterating through the lines, the `question` and `answer` strings are stripped of any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function.\n5. The function returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n  Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,638],"elapsed":5.196465208,"cost":0.0008205,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21757,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
