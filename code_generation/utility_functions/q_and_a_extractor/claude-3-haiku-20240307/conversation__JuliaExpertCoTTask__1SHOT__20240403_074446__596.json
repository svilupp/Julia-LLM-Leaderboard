Then, the `q_and_a_extractor` function uses `find_section` to locate the Question and Answer sections, extracts the text between those indices, and returns them as a tuple, stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nThe final step checks the solution with the provided example data, and the output matches the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[223,531],"elapsed":4.876118583,"cost":0.0007195000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12608,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
