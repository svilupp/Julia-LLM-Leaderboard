Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It finds the starting index of the \"# Question\" section using `findnext(\"# Question\", md, 1)`.\n2. It finds the starting index of the \"# Answer\" section using `findnext(\"# Answer\", md, question_start)`.\n3. It extracts the question text by slicing the markdown string from the end of the \"# Question\" header to the beginning of the \"# Answer\" header, and strips any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n4. It finds the ending index of the answer section by looking for the next double newline `\\n\\n`.\n5. It extracts the answer text by slicing the markdown string from the end of the \"# Answer\" header to the double newline, and strips any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n6. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,354],"elapsed":4.162905125,"cost":0.00047475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
