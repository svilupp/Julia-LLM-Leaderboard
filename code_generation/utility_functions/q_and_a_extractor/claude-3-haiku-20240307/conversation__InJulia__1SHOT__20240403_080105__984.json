The markdown-formatted text `md` is split into an array of lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. The function initializes variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer.\n3. The function iterates through the lines, checking if the current line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n4. If the current line starts with \"# Question\", the function extracts the question by concatenating all the following lines until it reaches a line that starts with \"# Answer\".\n5. If the current line starts with \"# Answer\", the function extracts the answer by concatenating all the following lines until it reaches a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n6. The function strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question and answer using the `strip()` function.\n7. Finally, the function returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the largest ocean in the world?\n\n# Answer\nThe largest ocean in the world is the Pacific Ocean.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,681],"elapsed":5.478409958,"cost":0.0008742500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27974,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
