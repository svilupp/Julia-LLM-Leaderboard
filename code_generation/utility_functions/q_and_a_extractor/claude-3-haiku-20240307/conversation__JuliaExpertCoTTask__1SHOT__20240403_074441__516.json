Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Use a regular expression to find the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections\n   - Extract the text between the start of the \"Question\" and the start of the \"Answer\"\n   - Extract the text between the start of the \"Answer\" and the end of the text\n   - Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n   - Return the question and answer as a tuple\n\n2. Write the necessary function:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections\n    question_start = match(r\"^# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = match(r\"^# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the text between the start of \"Question\" and \"Answer\"\n    question = strip(md[question_start.offset:answer_start.offset-1])\n    \n    # Extract the text between the start of \"Answer\" and the end of the text\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start.offset:end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n3.
