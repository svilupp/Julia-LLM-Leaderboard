[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the input text into individual lines using the `split()` function.\n3. It initializes variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and boolean variables `extracting_question` and `extracting_answer` to keep track of the current state of the extraction process.\n4. It iterates through the lines of the input text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `extracting_question` to `true`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `extracting_question` to `false` and `extracting_answer` to `true`.\n   - If `extracting_question` is `true`, it appends the line to the `question` string, stripping any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function.\n   - If `extracting_answer` is `true`, it appends the line to the `answer` string, stripping any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function.\n5. Finally, it returns the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nThe function should work correctly for the given task, and it follows the guidelines provided in the Special Instructions. The solution uses only standard Julia libraries and functions, and it prioritizes performance, clarity, and abstract types.","status":200,"tokens":[379,597],"elapsed":4.926489917,"cost":0.0008410000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31952,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
