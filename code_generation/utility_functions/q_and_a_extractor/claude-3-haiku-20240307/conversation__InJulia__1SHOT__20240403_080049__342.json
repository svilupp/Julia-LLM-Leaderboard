The function first splits the input markdown text into lines using the `split` function.\n2. It then initializes variables to store the question and answer, as well as flags to keep track of whether we're currently in a question or answer section.\n3. The function then iterates through the lines, checking if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the corresponding flag to `true` and the other flag to `false`.\n4. If we're in a question section, the function appends the line to the `question` variable. If we're in an answer section, it appends the line to the `answer` variable.\n5. After iterating through all the lines, the function trims any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` variables using the `strip` function.\n6. Finally, the function returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n   The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,618],"elapsed":5.226930958,"cost":0.0007955000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":865,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
