Define a helper function `extract_section` that takes the markdown text and a header regex, and extracts the text between the header and the next header or the end of the text.\n2. Use `extract_section` to extract the question and answer sections separately.\n3. Return the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nThe solution is brief and concise, following the steps of problem-solving approach.","status":200,"tokens":[223,417],"elapsed":4.433290625,"cost":0.000577,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15673,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
