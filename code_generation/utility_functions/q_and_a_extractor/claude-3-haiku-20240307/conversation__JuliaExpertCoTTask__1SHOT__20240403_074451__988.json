Find the start and end indices of the question and answer sections using `findfirst` to locate the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers.\n2. Extract the text between those indices using a helper function `extract_text`.\n3. Return the question and answer as a tuple.\n4. Add a test case to ensure the function works correctly.\n\nThe function handles the case where the question or answer sections are not present by returning `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[223,479],"elapsed":4.606915375,"cost":0.0006545,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27348,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
