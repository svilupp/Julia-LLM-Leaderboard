The function splits the input markdown text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. It then iterates through the lines, checking if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n3. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets the `extracting_question` flag to `true` and the `extracting_answer` flag to `false`.\n4. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets the `extracting_answer` flag to `true` and the `extracting_question` flag to `false`.\n5. If the `extracting_question` flag is `true`, it appends the line (with leading/trailing spaces removed using `strip()`) to the `question` string, separated by a newline.\n6. If the `extracting_answer` flag is `true`, it appends the line (with leading/trailing spaces removed) to the `answer` string, separated by a newline.\n7. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` strings.","status":200,"tokens":[134,512],"elapsed":4.680614875,"cost":0.0006735,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5749,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
