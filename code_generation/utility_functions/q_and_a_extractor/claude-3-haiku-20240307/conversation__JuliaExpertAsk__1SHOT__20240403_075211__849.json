Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It finds the start and end indices of the question and answer sections using the `findfirst` and `findnext` functions.\n2. It extracts the question and answer text using substring slicing and the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines.\n3. It returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  \nThis is the question.\n\n# Answer\n\nThis is the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: This is the question.\nAnswer: This is the answer.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[129,343],"elapsed":3.087002375,"cost":0.00046100000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31186,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
