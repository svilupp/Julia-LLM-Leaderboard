The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer, and two flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether we are currently in the question or answer section.\n4. It iterates through the lines and checks if the current line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the corresponding flag to `true` and the other flag to `false`.\n5. If we are in the question section, it appends the current line to the `question` variable, and if we are in the answer section, it appends the current line to the `answer` variable.\n6. After iterating through all the lines, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted `question` and `answer` strings using the `strip()` function.\n7. Finally, it returns the `question` and `answer` in a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  This is a sample question.\n# Answer\n  This is a sample answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: This is a sample question.\nAnswer: This is a sample answer.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,667],"elapsed":5.675003084,"cost":0.0008567500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10820,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
