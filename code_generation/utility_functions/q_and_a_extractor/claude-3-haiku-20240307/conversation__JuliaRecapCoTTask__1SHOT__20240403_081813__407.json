[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for the given task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    is_question = false\n    is_answer = false\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a question or answer header\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            is_question = true\n            is_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            is_answer = true\n            is_question = false\n        # Append the line to the question or answer\n        elseif is_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif is_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the input text into lines using the `split` function.\n3. It initializes variables to store the question and answer, and flags to keep track of whether the current line is part of the question or answer.\n4. It iterates through the lines, checking if the line is a question or answer header. If so, it updates the corresponding flag.\n5. If the current line is part of the question or answer, it appends the stripped line to the corresponding variable.\n6. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe function should work for the given task, and it follows the provided guidelines for Julia programming. It uses the standard library functions and avoids introducing any new packages unless explicitly requested.","status":200,"tokens":[380,427],"elapsed":4.302289666,"cost":0.0006287500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22557,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
