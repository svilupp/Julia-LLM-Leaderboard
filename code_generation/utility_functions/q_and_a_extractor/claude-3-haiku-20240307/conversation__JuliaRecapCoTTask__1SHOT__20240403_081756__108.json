[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We split the input text `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. We initialize variables `question`, `answer`, `in_question`, and `in_answer` to keep track of the current section we're in.\n3. We iterate through the lines, checking if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" to determine if we're in the question or answer section.\n4. If we're in the question section, we append the line (after stripping leading/trailing spaces) to the `question` variable.\n5. If we're in the answer section, we append the line (after stripping leading/trailing spaces) to the `answer` variable.\n6. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe function should handle the given markdown-formatted text correctly and return the question and answer sections as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[380,508],"elapsed":4.771736541,"cost":0.0007300000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3527,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
