[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The markdown text is split into lines using the `split()` function.\n2. We initialize variables `question`, `answer`, `is_question`, and `is_answer` to keep track of the current state of the extraction process.\n3. We iterate through the lines and check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, we update the state variables accordingly.\n4. If we're in a question or answer section, we append the line to the respective variable.\n5. Finally, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer using the `strip()` function and return them as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,533],"elapsed":4.752712875,"cost":0.0007610000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16332,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
