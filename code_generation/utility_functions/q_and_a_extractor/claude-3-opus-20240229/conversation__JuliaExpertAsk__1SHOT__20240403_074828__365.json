The function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. It splits the string into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n3. It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. It uses boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is within the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n5. It iterates over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the stripped line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After processing all lines, it removes any trailing newline characters from `question` and `answer` using `rstrip`.\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted text.\n\nThe function assumes that the markdown text follows the format where the question section starts with \"# Question\" and the answer section starts with \"# Answer\". It extracts the text between these sections, excluding the section headers themselves. Leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[129,589],"elapsed":21.052045666,"cost":0.04611,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
