[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We split the markdown text `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text. We also initialize two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently extracting text from the Question or Answer section.\n\n3. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`, indicating that we are entering the Question section. We use `continue` to skip to the next iteration.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`, indicating that we are entering the Answer section. We use `continue` to skip to the next iteration.\n\n4. If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` string, adding a newline character at the end.\n\n5. If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` string, adding a newline character at the end.\n\n6. After processing all the lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from both `question` and `answer`.\n\n7. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text as input and returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer text. It uses string concatenation to build the question and answer strings while iterating over the lines of the markdown text.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,605],"elapsed":24.946933833,"cost":0.05106,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30054,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
