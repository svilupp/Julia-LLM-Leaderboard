It splits the markdown text `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. It initializes variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections. It also initializes a variable `current_section` to keep track of the current section being processed.\n\n3. It iterates over each line in the `lines` array.\n\n4. For each line, it checks if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" using `startswith()`. If a section header is found, it updates the `current_section` variable accordingly and continues to the next line.\n\n5. If the current line is not a section header, it appends the stripped line to the corresponding section (`question` or `answer`) using `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace. It also adds a newline character `\"\\n\"` to preserve the line breaks.\n\n6. After processing all the lines, it strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the `question` and `answer` variables using `strip()`.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the extracted `question` and `answer` as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can call this function by passing the markdown-formatted text as an argument, and it will return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,705],"elapsed":27.003754708,"cost":0.054255,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6171,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
