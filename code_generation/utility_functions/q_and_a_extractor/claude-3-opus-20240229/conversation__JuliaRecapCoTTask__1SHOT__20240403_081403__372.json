[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are some useful Julia snippets for this task:\n\n1. To extract text between markdown headers:\n```julia\nfunction extract_section(text, header)\n    pattern = Regex(\"(?<=$header\\\\n)(.+?)(?=\\\\n#|\\\\Z)\", \"s\")\n    match(pattern, text).captures[1]\nend\n```\n\n2. To strip leading/trailing whitespace and newlines:\n```julia\nstrip(\"\"\"\n  some text\n  with newlines  \n\"\"\")\n```\n\nSolution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q = extract_section(md, \"# Question\") |> strip\n    a = extract_section(md, \"# Answer\") |> strip\n    (q, a)\nend\n\nfunction extract_section(text::AbstractString, header::AbstractString)\n    pattern = Regex(\"(?<=$header\\\\n)(.+?)(?=\\\\n#|\\\\Z)\", \"s\") \n    match(pattern, text).captures[1]\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Use the `extract_section` helper function to extract the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. It uses a regular expression to match all text after the specified header until the next header or end of string.\n\n2. Apply `strip` to the extracted question and answer text to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines. \n\n3. Return the results as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo double check:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\n2 + 2 = 4\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"2 + 2 = 4\")\n```\n\nThe function uses abstract string types and a clear step-by-step approach for good performance and generality.
