Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns them as a tuple:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We initialize two empty strings, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted question and answer sections.\n\n2. We split the markdown text `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and store them in the `lines` array.\n\n3. We initialize two boolean variables, `in_question` and `in_answer`, to keep track of whether we are currently inside the question or answer section.\n\n4. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we have entered the question section.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we have entered the answer section.\n\n5. If we are currently inside the question section (i.e., `in_question` is `true`), we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n\n6. If we are currently inside the answer section (i.e., `in_answer` is `true`), we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n\n7. After iterating through all the lines, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\n8. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function by passing a markdown-formatted text as a string to `q_and_a_extractor`. The function will return a tuple with the extracted question and answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[92,637],"elapsed":21.902830125,"cost":0.049155,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24784,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
