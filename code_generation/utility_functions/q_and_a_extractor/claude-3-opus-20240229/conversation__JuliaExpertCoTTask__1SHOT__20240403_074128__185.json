When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to extract the question and answer from the given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. Split the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. Initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer text.\n3. Use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the Question or Answer section.\n4. Iterate over each line in the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", set `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false, then continue to the next line.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", set `in_question` to false and `in_answer` to true, then continue to the next line.\n   - If `in_question` is true, append the current line to the `question` string followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is true, append the current line to the `answer` string followed by a newline character.\n5. After iterating through all the lines, use `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n6. Return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function successfully extracts the question and answer from the markdown text and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[223,606],"elapsed":22.333555084,"cost":0.048795,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26466,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
