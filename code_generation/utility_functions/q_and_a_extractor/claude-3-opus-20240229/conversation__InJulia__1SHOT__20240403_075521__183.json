The function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. It splits the markdown string into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer text, respectively.\n4. It also initializes flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is within the Question or Answer section.\n5. It iterates over each line of the markdown string:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skips to the next line.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skips to the next line.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After iterating over all the lines, it uses `strip()` to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nYou can call this function by passing a markdown-formatted string as an argument, and it will return the question and answer text as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[92,714],"elapsed":23.038164166,"cost":0.05492999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3102,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
