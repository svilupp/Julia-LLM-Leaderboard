We split the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` to process each line separately.\n\n2. We initialize two variables, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted question and answer text.\n\n3. We use two boolean flags, `in_question` and `in_answer`, to keep track of whether we are currently in the question or answer section.\n\n4. We iterate over each line of the markdown text:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skip to the next line using `continue`. This indicates that we are now in the question section.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skip to the next line using `continue`. This indicates that we are now in the answer section.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` variable, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` variable, followed by a newline character.\n\n5. After processing all the lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `question` and `answer` variables.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can call this function with a markdown-formatted text as input, and it will return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[92,732],"elapsed":25.623473708,"cost":0.05628,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":579,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
