The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. We split the text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and store them in the `lines` array.\n3. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections.\n4. We also initialize two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently within the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n5. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array.\n6. If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we are now within the \"Question\" section.\n7. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we are now within the \"Answer\" section.\n8. If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line (stripped of leading/trailing spaces) to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n9. If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line (stripped of leading/trailing spaces) to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n10. After iterating through all the lines, we use `rstrip` to remove any trailing newline characters from both `question` and `answer`.\n11. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nYou can use this function by passing a markdown-formatted text as input, and it will return a tuple with the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[92,643],"elapsed":25.217842,"cost":0.049604999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18269,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
