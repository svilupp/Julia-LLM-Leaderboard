The function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. We split the string into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. We use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the Question or Answer section.\n5. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skip to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skip to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If we are currently in the Question section (`in_question` is `true`), we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If we are currently in the Answer section (`in_answer` is `true`), we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After processing all the lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n7. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted Question and Answer text.\n\nThis function will extract the text from the Question and Answer sections of the markdown-formatted string and return them as a tuple, with leading/trailing whitespace and newlines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[129,576],"elapsed":20.567053208,"cost":0.045134999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3960,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
