The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. We split the text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and store them in the `lines` array.\n3. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections.\n4. We also initialize two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently processing the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n5. We loop through each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next iteration. This ensures that we start extracting the text for the \"Question\" section.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next iteration. This ensures that we start extracting the text for the \"Answer\" section.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After processing all the lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from both `question` and `answer`.\n7. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted \"Question\" and \"Answer\" text.\n\nYou can call this function by passing a markdown-formatted text as an argument, and it will return a tuple with the extracted \"Question\" and \"Answer\" text.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function will extract the text from the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections and return them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[92,736],"elapsed":28.138403708,"cost":0.05657999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9873,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
