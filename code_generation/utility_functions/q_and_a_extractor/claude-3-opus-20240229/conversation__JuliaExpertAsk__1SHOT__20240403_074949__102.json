We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer text, respectively.\n2. We use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the question or answer section of the markdown.\n3. We split the markdown string `md` by newline characters (`\\n`) to iterate over each line.\n4. For each line:\n   - If the line starts with `\"# Question\"`, we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false` to indicate that we are now in the question section.\n   - If the line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true` to indicate that we are now in the answer section.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` string, adding a newline character at the end.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` string, adding a newline character at the end.\n5. After processing all lines, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines) from both `question` and `answer` strings.\n6. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text has the format:\n```\n# Question\n...\n# Answer\n...\n```\nIt extracts the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, excluding the headings themselves.","status":200,"tokens":[129,575],"elapsed":21.455664459,"cost":0.045059999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12148,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
