[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nKey points:\n- The function takes an `AbstractString` parameter `md` and returns a `Tuple{String,String}` with extracted question and answer.\n- It splits the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. \n- It iterates through the lines, tracking if it is currently in the Question or Answer section using boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer`.\n- When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" it sets `in_question` to `true`. Similarly for \"# Answer\".\n- When in a Question/Answer section, it concatenates the current line to the `question`/`answer` string, adding a newline. This preserves the original line breaks.\n- After processing all lines, it strips any leading/trailing whitespace from the `question` and `answer` using `strip()`.\n- Finally it returns the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nThis should correctly extract the question and answer text from the given markdown format into a tuple, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,465],"elapsed":22.280997166,"cost":0.04056,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
