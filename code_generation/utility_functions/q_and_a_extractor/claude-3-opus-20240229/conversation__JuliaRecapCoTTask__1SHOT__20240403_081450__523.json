[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are some useful Julia snippets for this task:\n\nTo extract text between two substrings:\n```julia\nfunction extract_between(text, start_marker, end_marker)\n    start_index = findfirst(start_marker, text)\n    end_index = findlast(end_marker, text)\n    if !isnothing(start_index) && !isnothing(end_index)\n        return text[last(start_index)+1:first(end_index)-1]\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo strip leading whitespace and newlines:\n```julia\nstrip(text, ['\\n', ' '])\n```\n\nPutting it together:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = extract_between(md, \"# Question\", \"# Answer\") |> text -> strip(text, ['\\n', ' '])\n    answer = extract_between(md, \"# Answer\", \"\") |> text -> strip(text, ['\\n', ' '])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n- The `extract_between` helper finds the position of the start and end markers in the text using `findfirst` and `findlast`\n- If both are found, it returns the substring between the end of the start marker and start of the end marker \n- For the answer, we don't need an end marker since it goes to the end of the string\n- The extracted text is piped `|>` to strip leading newlines `\\n` and spaces\n- Finally the question and answer strings are returned in a tuple\n\nLet's double check with an example:\n\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is 2+2?\n\n# Answer\n2+2 = 4\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis returns:\n```\n(\"What is 2+2?\", \"2+2 = 4\")\n```\n\nLooks good! The function extracts the question and answer text, strips leading whitespace, and returns them in a tuple.
