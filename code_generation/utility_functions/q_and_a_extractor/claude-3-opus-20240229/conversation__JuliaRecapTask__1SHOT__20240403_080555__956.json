[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to extract the Question and Answer sections from a given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Split the markdown text `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. \n\n2. Initialize empty `question` and `answer` strings to store the extracted text. Also initialize `in_question` and `in_answer` booleans to track which section we are currently in.\n\n3. Loop through each `line`:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and `continue` to the next line without further processing the current line.\n   - Similarly, if the line starts with \"# Answer\", set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and `continue`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, append the current line and a newline to the `question` string.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, append the current line and a newline to the `answer` string.\n\n4. After processing all lines, use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\n5. Return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThe function uses `AbstractString` as the argument type to accept any string subtype. It processes the markdown line by line, tracking the current section, and building up the question and answer strings. Finally, it strips whitespace and returns the result as a tuple.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,561],"elapsed":23.249038125,"cost":0.04776,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15619,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
