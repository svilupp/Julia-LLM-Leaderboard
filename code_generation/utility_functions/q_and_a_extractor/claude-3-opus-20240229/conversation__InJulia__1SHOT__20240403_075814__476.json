We split the markdown text `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. We initialize two empty strings, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted question and answer, respectively.\n\n3. We initialize two boolean flags, `in_question` and `in_answer`, to keep track of whether we are currently in the Question or Answer section.\n\n4. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next line.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next line.\n   - If we are in the Question section (i.e., `in_question` is `true`), we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If we are in the Answer section (i.e., `in_answer` is `true`), we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n\n5. After iterating over all the lines, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can call this function by passing the markdown-formatted text as an argument, and it will return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[92,729],"elapsed":24.939334459,"cost":0.056054999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11648,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
