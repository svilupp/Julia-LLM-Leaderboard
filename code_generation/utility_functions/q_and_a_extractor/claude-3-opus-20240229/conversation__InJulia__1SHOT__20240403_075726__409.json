Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text from the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections of a given markdown-formatted text and returns them as a tuple:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n\n2. It splits the text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and stores them in the `lines` array.\n\n3. It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections.\n\n4. It initializes boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line belongs to the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n\n5. It iterates over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`, indicating that the following lines belong to the \"Question\" section. It then continues to the next iteration.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`, indicating that the following lines belong to the \"Answer\" section. It then continues to the next iteration.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `question` string, along with a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string, along with a newline character.\n\n6. After iterating over all the lines, it uses the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nYou can call this function by passing the markdown-formatted text as an argument. It will return a tuple with the extracted question and answer text, with any leading spaces and newlines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[92,649],"elapsed":23.576586209,"cost":0.050054999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8302,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
