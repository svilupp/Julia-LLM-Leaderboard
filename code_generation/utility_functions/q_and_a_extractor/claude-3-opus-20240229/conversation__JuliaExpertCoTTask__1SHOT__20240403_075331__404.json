It splits the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n2. It initializes variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text and `current_section` to keep track of the current section.\n3. It iterates through each line of the markdown text.\n4. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `current_section` to \"question\". If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `current_section` to \"answer\".\n5. If `current_section` is \"question\", it appends the line to the `question` string. If `current_section` is \"answer\", it appends the line to the `answer` string.\n6. After iterating through all the lines, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace from `question` and `answer` using `strip()`.\n7. Finally, it returns the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\nThe function correctly extracts the question and answer from the provided markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[223,633],"elapsed":21.757590584,"cost":0.05082,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13472,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
