[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract the Question and Answer sections from a given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current = \"question\"\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            current = \"answer\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if !isempty(line)\n            if current == \"question\"\n                question *= line * '\\n'\n            elseif current == \"answer\"\n                answer *= line * '\\n'\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We split the markdown text `md` into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`. \n\n2. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and a `current` string to keep track of which section we're currently in.\n\n3. We loop through each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `current` to \"question\" and `continue` to the next line. \n   - If it starts with \"# Answer\", we set `current` to \"answer\" and `continue`.\n   - If the line is not empty, we append it to either `question` or `answer` depending on the value of `current`. We add a newline character `\\n` after each line.\n\n4. After the loop, we use `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from `question` and `answer`.\n\n5. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted text.\n\nThe function uses an `AbstractString` as the argument type to handle any string type. It efficiently builds the result strings by concatenation. The logic follows the markdown structure to extract the relevant sections.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,495],"elapsed":22.66380925,"cost":0.04281,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19231,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
