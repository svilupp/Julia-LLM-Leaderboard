The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n3. It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. It uses two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is within the question or answer section.\n5. It iterates over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skips to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skips to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `question` string with a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string with a newline character.\n6. After processing all the lines, it uses `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis function will extract the text within the markdown sections \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and return them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,576],"elapsed":21.726320167,"cost":0.045134999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1577,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
