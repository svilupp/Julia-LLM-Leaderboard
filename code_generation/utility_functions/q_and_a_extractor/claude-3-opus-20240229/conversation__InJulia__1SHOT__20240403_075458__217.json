The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")` and stores them in the `lines` array.\n3. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections.\n4. We also initialize boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n5. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we are entering the \"Question\" section.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next line. This indicates that we are entering the \"Answer\" section.\n   - If we are currently in the \"Question\" section (`in_question` is `true`), we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If we are currently in the \"Answer\" section (`in_answer` is `true`), we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After iterating over all the lines, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n7. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nYou can call this function by passing the markdown-formatted text as an argument:\n\n```julia\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis is the capital of France.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris is the capital of France.\")\n```\n\nThe function extracts the text from the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections of the markdown text and returns them as a tuple, with leading spaces and newlines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[92,750],"elapsed":26.774768667,"cost":0.057629999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4941,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
