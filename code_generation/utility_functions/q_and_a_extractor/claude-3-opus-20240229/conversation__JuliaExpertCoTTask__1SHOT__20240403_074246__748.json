When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract the question and answer from the given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true \n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\njulia> q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\n       What is the capital of France?\n       \n       # Answer\n       The capital of France is Paris.\n       \")\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe approach is:\n1. Initialize empty `question` and `answer` strings \n2. Use flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track which section we are in\n3. Split the markdown text into lines\n4. For each line:\n   - If it starts with \"# Question\", set `in_question` flag\n   - If it starts with \"# Answer\", set `in_answer` flag \n   - If in question section, append line to `question`\n   - If in answer section, append line to `answer`\n5. Strip leading/trailing whitespace from extracted `question` and `answer`\n6. Return tuple of `(question, answer)`\n\nThe key aspects are using the section headers to determine which part of the text to extract, and building up the `question` and `answer` strings line by line.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[223,454],"elapsed":18.776990584,"cost":0.037395,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9491,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
