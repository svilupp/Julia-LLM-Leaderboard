We split the markdown-formatted text `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text from the respective sections.\n\n3. We initialize two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently processing the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n\n4. We iterate over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and continue to the next line.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and continue to the next line.\n   - If we are currently in the \"Question\" section (`in_question` is `true`), we append the stripped line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If we are currently in the \"Answer\" section (`in_answer` is `true`), we append the stripped line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n\n5. After processing all the lines, we use `rstrip` to remove any trailing newline character from both `question` and `answer`.\n\n6. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown-formatted text follows the convention of using \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" as section headers. It extracts the text from those sections, removes any leading spaces and newlines, and returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[92,632],"elapsed":23.030416083,"cost":0.04878,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
