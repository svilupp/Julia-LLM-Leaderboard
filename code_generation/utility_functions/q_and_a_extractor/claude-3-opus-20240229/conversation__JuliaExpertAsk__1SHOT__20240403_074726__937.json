Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise solution to extract the question and answer from the given markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    m = match(r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*# Answer\\s*(.*)\"s, md)\n    m === nothing && return (\"\", \"\")\n    return (strip(m[1]), strip(m[2]))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. It uses `match` with a regular expression to find the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n   - The regular expression uses `s` flag for dot-all mode to match newlines.\n   - `(.*?)` captures the text between the sections in a non-greedy way.\n3. If no match is found, it returns an empty tuple `(\"\", \"\")`.\n4. If a match is found, it extracts the captured groups using `m[1]` and `m[2]`.\n5. The extracted text is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace using `strip`.\n6. The function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted question and answer.\n\nThe function correctly handles cases where the markdown text doesn't contain the specified sections.","status":200,"tokens":[129,299],"elapsed":13.853567459,"cost":0.024359999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23432,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
