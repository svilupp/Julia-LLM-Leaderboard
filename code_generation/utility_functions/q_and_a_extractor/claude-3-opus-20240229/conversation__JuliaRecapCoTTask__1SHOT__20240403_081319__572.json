[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis does:\n\n1. Initialize empty `question` and `answer` strings to store the extracted text.\n\n2. Initialize boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track if we are currently inside the Question or Answer section. \n\n3. Loop through each line in the markdown text `md`:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skip to the next line\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skip to the next line\n   - Else, if `in_question` is `true`, append the current line and a newline to `question` \n   - Else if `in_answer` is `true`, append the current line and a newline to `answer`\n\n4. After the loop, `strip` any leading/trailing whitespace from `question` and `answer`.\n\n5. Return the extracted `(question, answer)` tuple.\n\nSo this will extract all the text under `# Question` into `question` and all text under `# Answer` into `answer`, ignoring any other sections.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[380,485],"elapsed":20.052009541,"cost":0.042075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6149,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
