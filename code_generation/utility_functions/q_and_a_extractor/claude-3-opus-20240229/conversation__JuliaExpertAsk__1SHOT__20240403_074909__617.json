The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. It uses boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line belongs to the Question or Answer section.\n5. It iterates over each line in the `lines` array:\n   - If the line starts with `\"# Question\"`, it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n6. After iterating over all lines, it uses the `strip` function to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newline characters from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted Question and Answer text.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text follows the format where the Question and Answer sections are defined using `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, respectively. It extracts the text between these headings and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,582],"elapsed":20.548471291,"cost":0.045584999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4332,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
