[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to extract the question and answer text from a markdown string in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find start and end index of Question section\n    q_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    q_end = findnext(\"# \", md, last(q_start))\n    \n    # Extract Question text, strip leading spaces/newlines\n    question = strip(md[last(q_start):first(q_end)-1])\n        \n    # Find start and end index of Answer section \n    a_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    a_end = findnext(\"# \", md, last(a_start))\n    a_end === nothing && (a_end = (lastindex(md)+1,)) # Edge case - Answer is last section\n    \n    # Extract Answer text, strip leading spaces/newlines\n    answer = strip(md[last(a_start):first(a_end)-1])\n            \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Use `findfirst` to locate the start index of the \"# Question\" section. \n\n2. Use `findnext` to locate the end index of the Question section by finding the next \"# \" after the start of the Question.\n\n3. Extract the substring between these indexes and `strip` any leading/trailing whitespace to get the question text.\n\n4. Repeat similar steps for the \"# Answer\" section to extract the answer text.\n\n5. Handle the edge case where Answer is the last section by setting `a_end` to the end of the full string.\n\n6. Return the extracted `question` and `answer` in a tuple.\n\nThe function uses `AbstractString` to accept any string type. It returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted text.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,445],"elapsed":21.944190166,"cost":0.03906,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11335,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
