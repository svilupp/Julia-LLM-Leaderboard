We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n2. We use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the Question or Answer section.\n3. We split the markdown string `md` into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n4. We iterate over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - Otherwise, if we are currently in the Question section (`in_question` is `true`), we append the line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - Similarly, if we are currently in the Answer section (`in_answer` is `true`), we append the line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n5. After processing all the lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the `question` and `answer` strings.\n6. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text has a specific format where the question and answer sections are marked with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headings, respectively. It extracts the text between those headings and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,560],"elapsed":20.660855208,"cost":0.043934999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10631,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
