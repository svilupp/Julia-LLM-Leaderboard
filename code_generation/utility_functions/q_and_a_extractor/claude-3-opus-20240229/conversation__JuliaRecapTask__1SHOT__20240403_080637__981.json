[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to extract the question and answer sections from a given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # State: 0=outside section, 1=in question, 2=in answer \n    state = 0\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = 1\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = 2 \n            answer = \"\"\n        else\n            if state == 1\n                question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            elseif state == 2\n                answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis uses the following approach:\n\n1. Split the markdown text into lines\n2. Initialize state to 0 (outside of a Question/Answer section)\n3. Loop through each line:\n   - If line starts with \"# Question\", set state=1 and reset question \n   - If line starts with \"# Answer\", set state=2 and reset answer\n   - Else, if state=1 append line to question, if state=2 append to answer\n4. After loop, strip leading/trailing whitespace from question and answer \n5. Return tuple of (question, answer)\n\nThe key aspects are:\n\n- Using a state machine approach to track if we are currently in a Question, Answer or no section\n- Accumulating the question and answer text by appending lines \n- Stripping the accumulated text at the end to remove any extra whitespace\n\nLet me know if this makes sense or if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,434],"elapsed":19.209718834,"cost":0.038235,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29329,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
