We split the markdown text `md` into individual lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n2. We initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted question and answer text.\n3. We use flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether we are currently extracting the question or answer.\n4. We iterate over each line in `lines`:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and skip to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and skip to the next line using `continue`.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` string, adding a newline character `\\n` to preserve line breaks.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` string, adding a newline character `\\n` to preserve line breaks.\n5. After iterating over all lines, we use `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from both `question` and `answer`.\n6. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text follows the format where the question section starts with \"# Question\" and the answer section starts with \"# Answer\". It extracts the text between these section headers and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,586],"elapsed":20.75779075,"cost":0.045884999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26431,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
