It splits the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. It initializes empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n\n3. It uses boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether the current line is within the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n\n4. It iterates over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`, indicating that the following lines belong to the question section.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`, indicating that the following lines belong to the answer section.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `question` string.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, it appends the current line to the `answer` string.\n\n5. After iterating over all lines, it uses `strip()` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from the extracted `question` and `answer` strings.\n\n6. Finally, it returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThe function correctly extracts the question and answer from the given markdown text and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[223,638],"elapsed":21.644331458,"cost":0.051195,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30364,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
