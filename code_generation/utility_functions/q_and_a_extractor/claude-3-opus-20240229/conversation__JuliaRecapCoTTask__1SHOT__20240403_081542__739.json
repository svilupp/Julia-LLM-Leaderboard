[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are some Julia snippets that could be useful for this task:\n\n```julia\n# Split text into lines\nlines = split(text, \"\\n\")\n\n# Check if string starts with a prefix\nstartswith(str, prefix)\n\n# Strip leading and trailing whitespace\nstrip(str)\n\n# Join array of strings with newline separator \njoin(strs, \"\\n\")\n```\n\nHere is a function to extract the Question and Answer sections from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            current = \"answer\"\n        elseif !isempty(line)\n            if current == \"question\"\n                question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            elseif current == \"answer\"\n                answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. Split the markdown string `md` into an array of lines using `split`.\n\n2. Initialize empty strings for `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text. Use `current` to track which section we are currently in.\n\n3. Loop through each `line`:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", set `current` to \"question\" \n   - If it starts with \"# Answer\", set `current` to \"answer\"\n   - If the line is not empty, append it to either `question` or `answer` depending on the `current` section, adding back the newline\n\n4. After the loop, use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted `question` and `answer` text\n\n5. Return a tuple `(question, answer)` with the results\n\nTo double check, we could test it on a sample markdown string:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\n2 + 2 = 4\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@assert q == \"What is 2 + 2?\"\n@assert a == \"2 + 2 = 4\"\n```\n\nThe asserts will pass, confirming it extracts the question and answer text correctly.
