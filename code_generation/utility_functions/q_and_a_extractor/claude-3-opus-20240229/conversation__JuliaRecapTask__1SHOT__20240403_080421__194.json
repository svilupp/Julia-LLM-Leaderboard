[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to extract the question and answer text from a given markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We initialize two empty strings, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted text.\n\n2. We also initialize two boolean flags, `in_question` and `in_answer`, to keep track of whether we are currently inside the \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n\n3. We split the input markdown string `md` into individual lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n4. We iterate over each line:\n   - If the line starts with \"# Question\", we set `in_question` to `true`, `in_answer` to `false`, and `continue` to the next line since we don't want to include the section header in the extracted text.\n   - If the line starts with \"# Answer\", we set `in_question` to `false`, `in_answer` to `true`, and `continue` to the next line.\n   - If `in_question` is `true`, we append the current line to the `question` string, followed by a newline character.\n   - If `in_answer` is `true`, we append the current line to the `answer` string, followed by a newline character.\n\n5. After processing all the lines, we use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from both `question` and `answer`.\n\n6. Finally, we return a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text follows the format where the question section starts with \"# Question\" and the answer section starts with \"# Answer\". It extracts the text between these sections and returns them as a tuple.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","status":200,"tokens":[379,591],"elapsed":25.942002583,"cost":0.05001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
