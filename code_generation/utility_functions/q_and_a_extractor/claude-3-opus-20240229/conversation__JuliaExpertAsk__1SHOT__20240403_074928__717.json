Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that extracts the question and answer text from a given markdown-formatted string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the start and end positions of the question and answer sections\n    q_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    a_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    a_end = findnext(\"\\n#\", md, a_start)\n    a_end = a_end === nothing ? lastindex(md) : a_end - 1\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = strip(md[q_start+10:a_start-1])\n    answer = strip(md[a_start+8:a_end])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We use `findfirst` to find the starting positions of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" sections in the markdown string.\n\n2. We find the end position of the answer section by searching for the next occurrence of \"\\n#\" (newline followed by a hash symbol) after the start of the answer section. If there is no next occurrence, we assume the answer ends at the last index of the string.\n\n3. We extract the question text by slicing the markdown string from the end of \"# Question\" to the start of \"# Answer\" (excluding the newline). We use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n4. Similarly, we extract the answer text by slicing the markdown string from the end of \"# Answer\" to the end position of the answer section (or the end of the string). We use `strip` to remove any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown string contains exactly one question and one answer section, and that the question section appears before the answer section.\n\nYou can call this function with a markdown string as input, and it will return a tuple with the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[129,465],"elapsed":18.54207175,"cost":0.036809999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26149,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
