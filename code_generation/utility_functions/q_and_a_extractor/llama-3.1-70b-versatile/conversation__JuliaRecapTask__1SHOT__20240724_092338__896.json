[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We first split the markdown text into sections using the `split` function with the separator `\"\\n# \"`. This will give us an array of strings where each string is a section of the markdown text.\n2. We then initialize two variables, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted text.\n3. We iterate over each section using a `for` loop. For each section, we check if it's the question or answer section using the `startswith` function.\n4. If it's the question section, we extract the question text by stripping the leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` function. We also remove the `# Question` header by slicing the string from the 9th character to the end.\n5. If it's the answer section, we extract the answer text in a similar way.\n6. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple using the `return` statement.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample markdown text like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[353,423],"elapsed":2.553373,"cost":0.0005424399999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1039456312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
