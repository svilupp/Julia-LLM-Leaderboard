[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We split the markdown text into sections using a regular expression that matches the start of a line (`^`) followed by `#` and either `Question` or `Answer`. The `(?m)` flag enables multiline mode, which allows the `^` anchor to match the start of each line.\n2. We initialize variables to store the question and answer.\n3. We iterate over the sections, stripping leading and trailing whitespace from each section using the `strip` function.\n4. We check if the section is the question or answer by checking its index. If it's the second section (`i == 2`), it's the question; if it's the fourth section (`i == 4`), it's the answer.\n5. We assign the stripped section to the corresponding variable (question or answer).\n6. Finally, we return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(question)  # Output: \"What is the meaning of life?\"\nprintln(answer)  # Output: \"42\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[354,452],"elapsed":2.285199542,"cost":0.0005659399999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1470263484,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
