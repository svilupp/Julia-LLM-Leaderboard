The extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines, and returned as a tuple. The function is tested with the provided markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[212,262],"elapsed":5.18458775,"cost":0.00033206,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-304649875,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
