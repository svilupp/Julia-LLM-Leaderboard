It then iterates through the document's blocks, searching for headers of level 1 with the text \"Question\" or \"Answer\". When a matching header is found, it extracts the next block (assuming it's a paragraph) and returns it as the question or answer. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nTo use the function, you would pass a markdown-formatted string like this:\n\n```julia\nmd_string = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_string)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis should output the following:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,554],"elapsed":5.909957791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":291271978,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
