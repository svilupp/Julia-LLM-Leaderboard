[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif in_question\n            push!(questions, chomp(strip(line)))\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answers, chomp(strip(line)))\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Number of questions and answers don't match.\"))\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into lines, then iterates through the lines. If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate that it should start collecting the subsequent lines as the question or answer. It also strips leading and trailing whitespace and newlines from each line before adding it to the question or answer.\n\nAt the end, it checks that the number of questions and answers is the same, and returns the first question-answer pair if so. If the numbers don't match, it throws an error.\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed, and that every \"# Question\" is followed by exactly one question, and every \"# Answer\" is followed by exactly one answer. If those assumptions don't hold, the function may not work correctly.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\n# Question\nWho is the current President of the United States?\n\n# Answer\nJoe Biden\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n\n# Output:\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\n# Answer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,554],"elapsed":6.14085225,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1810250301,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
