If it does, it sets a flag indicating that it's in the Question or Answer section, respectively. It then appends any subsequent lines to the appropriate list, stripping any leading spaces or newlines. Finally, it joins the lists of lines together into a single string for each section and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[136,348],"elapsed":3.826805917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1099345276,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
