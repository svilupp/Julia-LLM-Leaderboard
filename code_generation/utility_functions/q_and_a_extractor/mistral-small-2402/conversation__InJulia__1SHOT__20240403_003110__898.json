The function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. It first splits the string into lines.\n3. Then, it iterates through the lines, keeping track of whether it's currently in a Question or Answer section using the `in_question` and `in_answer` variables.\n4. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the appropriate variable to `true` and clears the current text.\n5. If it's currently in a Question or Answer section, it appends the line (with any leading or trailing whitespace removed) to the current text.\n6. If it encounters a line that starts with `#` but isn't starting a new Question or Answer section, it knows that it's reached the end of the current section, so it pushes the current text onto the appropriate array.\n7. Finally, if both the `questions` and `answers` arrays are non-empty, it returns the last Question and Answer as a tuple. If either array is empty, it returns an empty string for the corresponding element of the tuple.\n\nYou can test the function with some example markdown text like this:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer:   $(answer)\")\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer:   The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,782],"elapsed":8.503631875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1049120492,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
