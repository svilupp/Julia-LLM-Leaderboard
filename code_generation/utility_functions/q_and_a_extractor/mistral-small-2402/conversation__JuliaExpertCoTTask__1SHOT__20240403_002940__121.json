If a section header is found, the function continues to the next line without processing the current one. If the line is part of the question or answer section, it is concatenated to the appropriate string with any leading newlines and spaces removed.\n\nThe function returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[237,401],"elapsed":7.393424833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1640411167,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
