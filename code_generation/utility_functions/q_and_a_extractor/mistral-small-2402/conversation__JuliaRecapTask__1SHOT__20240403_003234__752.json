[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

If it does, the function sets the appropriate boolean variable to `true` and resets the `current_text` variable to an empty string.\n* If the current line is inside a question or answer section, the function appends the line (with a newline character) to the `current_text` variable.\n* If the current line is not empty and either starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` or is empty, the function checks if it is currently inside a question or answer section. If it is, it pushes the current text (stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace) to the appropriate array and resets the `current_text` variable to an empty string.\n* Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `questions` and `answers` arrays.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\n# Question\nWhat is the largest planet in the solar system?\n\n# Answer\nJupiter\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor q in questions\n    println(q)\nend\nprintln(\"\\nAnswers:\")\nfor a in answers\n    println(a)\nend\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nQuestions:\nWhat is the capital of France?\nWhat is the largest planet in the solar system?\n\nAnswers:\nParis\nJupiter\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,806],"elapsed":8.933218542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1324925739,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
