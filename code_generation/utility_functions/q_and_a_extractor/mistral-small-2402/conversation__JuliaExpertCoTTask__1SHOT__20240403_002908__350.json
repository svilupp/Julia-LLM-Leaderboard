It then iterates through each line of the markdown-formatted text. If the line starts with a `#`, it assumes that a new section has started and sets the `current_section` variable accordingly. If it's inside a section, it checks if the current section is either \"Question\" or \"Answer\", and if so, adds the stripped line to the respective vector.\n\nAfter processing all lines, it checks if the number of questions and answers are equal. If not, it throws an error. Finally, it returns the first question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[237,516],"elapsed":5.838471042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1498273205,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
