It then iterates through the nodes in the resulting AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and extracts the content of the Question and Answer sections. The extracted content is stripped of any leading spaces and newlines, and the function returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nTo use this function, first add the Markdown package to your environment if you haven't already:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Markdown\")\n```\n\nThen, you can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(answer)\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[136,538],"elapsed":5.881469417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-481667151,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
