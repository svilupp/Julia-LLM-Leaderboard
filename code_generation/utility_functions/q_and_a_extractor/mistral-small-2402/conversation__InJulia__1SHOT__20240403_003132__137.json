It first splits the text into lines using the `split` function. It then initializes variables to store the question and answer, and iterates through the lines of the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag to indicate that it should start extracting the question. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate that it should start extracting the answer. It then appends each line to the appropriate variable, depending on which section it is currently in.\n\nAfter it has finished iterating through the lines, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the question and answer using the `strip` function. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use the function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(answer)\")\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,633],"elapsed":6.828648792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1181256933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
