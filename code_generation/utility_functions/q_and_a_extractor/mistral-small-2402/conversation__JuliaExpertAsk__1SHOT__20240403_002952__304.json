When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets `current_section` to \"question\" or \"answer\", respectively. If `current_section` is not empty, it appends the stripped line to the appropriate array (`questions` or `answers`). Finally, it returns a tuple containing the joined question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[136,309],"elapsed":3.333365709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1067763533,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
