If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate that it should start collecting text for that section. If it encounters a line that doesn't start with \"#\", it appends the line (with leading and trailing whitespace removed) to the current section's text. When it's finished, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,313],"elapsed":4.880729458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1532635549,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
