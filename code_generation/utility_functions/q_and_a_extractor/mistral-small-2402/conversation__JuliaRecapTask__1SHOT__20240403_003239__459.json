[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts the Question and Answer from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q_start = \"# Question\"\n    a_start = \"# Answer\"\n    q_found = false\n    q_text = \"\"\n    a_text = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, q_start)\n            q_found = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, a_start)\n            q_found = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if q_found\n            q_text = strip(q_text * \"\\n\" * line)\n        else\n            a_text = strip(a_text * \"\\n\" * line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (q_text, a_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts collecting text into the `q_text` variable. When it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops collecting text into `q_text` and starts collecting text into `a_text`.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the collected text.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(answer)\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that the Answer section always comes after the Question section. It does not handle cases where there are multiple Question/Answer pairs in the text. If these cases need to be handled, the function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[402,492],"elapsed":5.377730875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1543137899,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
