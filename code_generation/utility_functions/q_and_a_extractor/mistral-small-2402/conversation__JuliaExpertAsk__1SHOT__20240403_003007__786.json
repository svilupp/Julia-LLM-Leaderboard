If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, the current section is set accordingly. If the current section is nonempty, the trimmed and stripped line is added to the corresponding `questions` or `answers` array. Finally, the function returns a tuple of the joined question and answer strings.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[136,413],"elapsed":4.431342459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1560928308,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
