If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets a flag indicating whether it's currently in the question or answer section. It then appends the current line (with a newline character) to a buffer, and if it's at the end of a section, it strips the buffer and adds it to the corresponding vector. At the end, it returns the last question and answer it found.","status":200,"tokens":[136,335],"elapsed":6.335431708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1649274300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
