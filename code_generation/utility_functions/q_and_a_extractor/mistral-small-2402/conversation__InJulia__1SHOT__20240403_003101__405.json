If it finds a header node with the text \"# Question\", it sets the question text to the content of the next node. Similarly, if it finds a header node with the text \"# Answer\", it sets the answer text to the content of all subsequent nodes. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple, removing any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,408],"elapsed":4.419833333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-259830876,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
