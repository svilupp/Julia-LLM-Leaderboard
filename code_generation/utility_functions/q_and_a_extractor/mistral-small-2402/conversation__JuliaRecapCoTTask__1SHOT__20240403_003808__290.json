[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions, here is a Julia function that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns the answer in a tuple. The function uses the `eachline` and `split` functions from Julia's standard library.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= chomp(line) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= chomp(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the markdown-formatted text. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets a flag indicating that the following lines should be added to the `question` string. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets a flag indicating that the following lines should be added to the `answer` string. The function returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer strings at the end of the input.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThis function adheres to the provided guidelines by using Julia's standard libraries, preferring general type annotations, emphasizing performance and clarity, and avoiding new packages unless explicitly requested.","status":200,"tokens":[404,501],"elapsed":9.845109542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-22411019,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
