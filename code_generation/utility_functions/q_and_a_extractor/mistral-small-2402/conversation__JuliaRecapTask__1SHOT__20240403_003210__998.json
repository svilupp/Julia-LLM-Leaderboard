[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then iterates over this tree, keeping track of the last encountered Question and Answer headers, and accumulating the text of any Paragraph nodes that are children of these headers.\n\nOnce it has processed the entire tree, it returns the question and answer texts as a tuple.\n\nHere's a sample usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@show question\n@show answer\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nquestion = \"What is the capital of France?\"\nanswer = \"Paris\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,446],"elapsed":4.835717542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1110350198,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
