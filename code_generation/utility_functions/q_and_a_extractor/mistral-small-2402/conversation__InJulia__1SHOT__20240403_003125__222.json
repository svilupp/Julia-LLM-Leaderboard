[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple Julia function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for node in doc\n        if isa(node, MDHeading) && node.level == 1\n            text = lowercase(strip(node.text))\n            if startswith(text, \"question\")\n                question = strip(MDLeaf(node.content...).text)\n            elseif startswith(text, \"answer\")\n                answer = strip(MDLeaf(node.content...).text)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by parsing the markdown string into an abstract syntax tree using Julia's Markdown.jl package. It then iterates over the nodes in the tree and checks if each node is a first-level heading (i.e., a line starting with a single `#`). If it is, it checks if the text of the heading starts with \"question\" or \"answer\", and if so, it extracts the text of the following node (which should be the text of the question or answer) and stores it. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[95,311],"elapsed":3.354863,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-606780849,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
