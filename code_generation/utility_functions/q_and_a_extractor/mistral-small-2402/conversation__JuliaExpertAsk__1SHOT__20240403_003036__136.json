It then traverses the tree, keeping track of whether it's currently in a question or answer section based on the headings it encounters. When it finds a text node in the appropriate section, it appends the text to the corresponding string. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[136,311],"elapsed":3.450998667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1305331745,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
