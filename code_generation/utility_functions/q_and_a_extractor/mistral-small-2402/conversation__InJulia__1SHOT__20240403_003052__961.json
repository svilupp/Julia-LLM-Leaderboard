If it finds them, it sets the corresponding flags to `true`.\n\nThen, it checks if the node is a paragraph and if the corresponding flag is `true`. If it is, it appends the stripped and rendered text to the question or answer string.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[95,389],"elapsed":4.162465375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1627921039,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
