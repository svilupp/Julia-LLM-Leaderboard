It then iterates through the nodes in the tree and extracts the text of the nodes following the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(answer)\")\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,449],"elapsed":4.815260042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1715886087,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
