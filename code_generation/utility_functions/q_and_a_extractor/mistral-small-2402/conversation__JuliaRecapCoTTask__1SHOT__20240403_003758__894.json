[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description and special instructions (which are not provided), here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    questions = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    answers = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            push!(questions, strip(line))\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(questions) && !isempty(answers)\n        return (questions[end], join(answers, '\\n'))\n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines, then iterates over those lines. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it begins storing subsequent lines into the `questions` array. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it starts storing subsequent lines into the `answers` array. It continues this process until the end of the input string. Finally, it returns the last question and all the answers joined together with newlines.\n\nThe function uses `AbstractString` for the input and output types to be flexible with different string types, and it uses `Vector{AbstractString}` for the `questions` and `answers` arrays to allow for different string types as well.\n\nThe function assumes that each markdown document contains at least one question-answer pair, and that each question-answer pair is separated by a line with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". If the input string does not contain any question-answer pairs, the function returns an empty string for both the question and the answer.\n\nThe function uses multiple dispatch on the `AbstractString` type to handle strings of different types, and it uses standard Julia functions like `startswith`, `split`, `strip`, and `join` to process the input string. It does not use any external packages.","status":200,"tokens":[404,533],"elapsed":5.9990245,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":640836588,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
