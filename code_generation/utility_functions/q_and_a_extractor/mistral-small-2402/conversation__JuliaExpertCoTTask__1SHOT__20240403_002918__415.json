It then finds the indices of the Question and Answer sections using `findfirst` and Julia's string functions `startswith`. It extracts the Question and Answer text using array slicing and `join` to concatenate the lines into a single string. It then strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using `strip`. Finally, it returns the answer in a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are present in the markdown text and are in the correct order. If this is not the case, it will need to be modified to handle these situations.","status":200,"tokens":[237,476],"elapsed":5.169797792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-355091523,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
