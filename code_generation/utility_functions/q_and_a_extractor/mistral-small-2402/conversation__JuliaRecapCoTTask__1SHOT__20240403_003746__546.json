[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns them as a tuple:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question::AbstractString = \"\"\n    answer::AbstractString = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize flags to keep track of the current section\n    in_question::Bool = false\n    in_answer::Bool = false\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # If the line starts with '# Question', start capturing the question\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If the line starts with '# Answer', start capturing the answer\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we're in the question section, append the line to the question\n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n\n        # If we're in the answer section, append the line to the answer\n        if in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the lines of the markdown text and keeping track of whether it is currently in the question or answer section. When it finds a line that starts with '# Question', it starts appending lines to the `question` variable. When it finds a line that starts with '# Answer', it stops appending to `question` and starts appending to `answer` instead. The function returns the question and answer as a tuple, with any leading or trailing whitespace stripped off.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[404,574],"elapsed":6.414426916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1758485654,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
