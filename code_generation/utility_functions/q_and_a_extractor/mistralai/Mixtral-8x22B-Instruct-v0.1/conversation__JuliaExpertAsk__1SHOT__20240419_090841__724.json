If it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate that it should start collecting the following lines for that section. It then appends each line to the appropriate string, stripping any leading whitespace. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[145,269],"elapsed":26.159776375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1304485104,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
