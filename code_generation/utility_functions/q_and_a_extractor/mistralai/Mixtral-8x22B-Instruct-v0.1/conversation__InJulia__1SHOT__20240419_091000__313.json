Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(lines[i+1])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(lines[i+1])\n            if !isnothing(question) && !isnothing(answer)\n                return (question, answer)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (nothing, nothing)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input and returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. It first splits the input text into lines and then iterates over the lines. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to the next line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to the next line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). If both `question` and `answer` are not `nothing`, it returns the tuple `(question, answer)`. If it does not find a question-answer pair, it returns `(nothing, nothing)`.","status":200,"tokens":[104,337],"elapsed":7.730648959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1470753320,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
