Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(lines[i+1])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(lines[i+1])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        error(\"Invalid markdown format: Question or Answer not found\")\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input and returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. It first splits the input into lines and then iterates through each line. If it finds a line starting with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to the next line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). Similarly, if it finds a line starting with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to the next line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines) and breaks the loop. If either the `question` or `answer` variable is not set by the end of the loop, the function throws an error indicating an invalid markdown format.","status":200,"tokens":[104,326],"elapsed":7.260711042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1726741211,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
