Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = answer = nothing\n    in_question = in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            question = strip(replace(line, \"# Question\" => \"\"))\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))\n        elseif in_question && !occursin(\"#\", line)\n            question *= \" \" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer && !occursin(\"#\", line)\n            answer *= \" \" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line in the markdown text and checks if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, the function sets the corresponding flag (`in_question` or `in_answer`) to `true` and extracts the text after the keyword. If the line does not start with a `#` and the function is currently in a question or answer section, it appends the line to the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`).\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. If no question or answer is found, the corresponding value in the tuple will be `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[104,353],"elapsed":7.753139584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1428549284,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
