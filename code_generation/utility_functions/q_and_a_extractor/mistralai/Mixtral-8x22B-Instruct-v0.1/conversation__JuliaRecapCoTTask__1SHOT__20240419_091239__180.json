[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem description and special instructions, here is a Julia function that extracts the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= lstrip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= lstrip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each line in the markdown text and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the corresponding flag to `true`. If the flag is `true`, it appends the line (with leading spaces removed) to the question or answer string. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings with leading and trailing spaces removed.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is properly formatted and that the question and answer sections are not nested within each other. If the markdown text is not properly formatted, the function may not work as expected.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle cases where there are multiple question and answer sections in the markdown text. If you need to handle such cases, you will need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nThis function uses the `startswith` function to check if a string starts with a certain substring, the `lstrip` function to remove leading spaces from a string, and the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing spaces from a string. It also uses the `split` function to split the markdown text into lines.","status":200,"tokens":[413,444],"elapsed":18.79710325,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1845102414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
