The `ms` flags in the regex patterns allow for multiline matching and treat the input as a single line respectively. The function then extracts, strips, and returns the relevant sections as a tuple. If no matches are found, empty strings are returned for the respective sections.","status":200,"tokens":[126,210],"elapsed":4.841323334,"cost":0.00756,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1989507672,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
