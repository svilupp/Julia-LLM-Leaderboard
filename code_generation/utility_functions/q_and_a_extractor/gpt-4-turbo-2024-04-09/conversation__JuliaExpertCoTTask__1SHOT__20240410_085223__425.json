Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to extract text from markdown formatted sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. After identifying these sections, we will extract the text that follows them, trimming any leading or trailing spaces or newlines. The result will be returned as a tuple containing the question text and the answer text.\n\n## Plan:\n1. Split the markdown content using the line break `\\n` to process each line individually.\n2. Use flags or state indicators to determine when we are currently reading a `Question` section or an `Answer` section.\n3. As we process each line, we will check for sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer` to adjust our flags accordingly.\n4. Collect the content for the question and the answer based on these flags.\n5. Finally, after processing all lines, return the collected question and answer strings as a tuple.\n\nThis extraction process will handle the basic markdown structure and clean up any unnecessary whitespace.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md: str) -> tuple:\n    lines = md.split('\\n')  # Split the markdown text by new lines\n    capturing_question = False\n    capturing_answer = False\n    question_parts = []\n    answer_parts = []\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            capturing_question = True\n            capturing_answer = False\n            continue\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            capturing_answer = True\n            capturing_question = False\n            continue\n        \n        if capturing_question:\n            question_parts.append(line)\n        elif capturing_answer:\n            answer_parts.append(line)\n    \n    # Join parts into single cleaned up strings stripping empty parts\n    question = \"\\n\".join(part for part in question_parts if part).strip()\n    answer = \"\\n\".join(part for part in answer_parts if part).strip()\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\n```\n\nThis function will read through the provided markdown content, identify and group texts under the sections for \"Question\" and \"Answer\", and finally return them in a tuple format.\n\nThis process ensures that only text under designated headings is extracted and that unnecessary whitespace is removed from the result.","status":200,"tokens":[208,478],"elapsed":18.948913042,"cost":0.01642,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-306246253,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
