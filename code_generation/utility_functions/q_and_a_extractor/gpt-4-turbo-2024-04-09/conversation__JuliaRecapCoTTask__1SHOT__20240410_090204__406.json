[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract the Question and Answer parts from the given markdown text, we need to parse the text with the following approach:\n\n1. Identify sections of text beginning with `# Question` and `# Answer` respectively.\n2. Extract the content for each section without the markdown heading.\n3. Ignore leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines for cleaner messages.\n4. Return results packaged in a tuple.\n\nThe solution involves:\n- String manipulation to isolate sections based on `# Question` and `# Answer` markers.\n- Differential handling of line breaks and formatting to gather content appropriately.\n\nIn Julia, we would normally use string functions like `findfirst`, `findnext`, `split`, `strip`, etc., to manipulate the markdown text and extract relevant information.\n\n```julia\n# Function to extract the question and answer from a given markdown text\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # First split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    # Traverse each line and check if it marks the beginning of the question or answer\n    for line in lines\n        # Strip whitespace for cleaner detection\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Add the line to the respective content if it's part of `Question` or `Answer` sections\n        if in_question\n            push!(question, line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n        \n        # Turn off capture if a new section potentially starts (assuming sections start with `#`)\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"#\") && !(startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\") || startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\"))\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Combine lines and remove the leading/trailing white spaces\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function dynamically captures the text under `# Question` until it finds another section starting with `#`, similar for `# Answer`. It will sanitize input by ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces and joins content appropriately. The result is a tuple with both parts of the markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[350,540],"elapsed":12.291572958,"cost":0.0197,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1075055398,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
