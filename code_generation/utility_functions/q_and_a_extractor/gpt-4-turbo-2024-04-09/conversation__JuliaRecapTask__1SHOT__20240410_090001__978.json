[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Splitting can be done using `split()` or `splitlines()` to break at different delimiters like newlines.\n    - Using string functions like `strip()` to remove any unnecessary leading or trailing whitespace.\n    - Parsing through lines, `startswith()` can help identify lines that start with a particular pattern.\n \n2. **Solve The Task**:\n    - A step-by-step plan:\n        1. Split the input markdown text into lines.\n        2. Iterate over the lines to find sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n        3. Capture the text following these headings until the next heading or the end of the document.\n        4. Clean the captured text to remove any spurious whitespace or newlines.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**:\n    - Ensure corner cases are handled, such as markdowns that begin immediately with the headings or cases where there's no \"Answer\" section.\n    - Check if multiple \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections exist, ensuring they are captured correctly.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Split the Markdown content into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    capturing = false\n    q_or_a = nothing\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n\n    # Iterate through each line and identify Question and Answer sections\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Determine whether we are switching to question or answer\n            if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n                if q_or_a == :question # we were already capturing a question\n                    push!(question, strip(line[11:end]))\n                end\n                q_or_a = :question\n            elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n                if q_or_a == :answer # we were already capturing an answer\n                    push!(answer, strip(line[9:end]))\n                end\n                q_or_a = :answer\n            end\n            capturing = true\n        elseif capturing\n            # Add lines to the respective containers\n            if q_or_a == :question\n                push!(question, strip(line))\n            elseif q_or_a == :answer\n                push!(answer, strip(line))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join lines for question and answer and return them as a tuple\n    return (join(question, \" \"), join(answer, \" \"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function captures the logic needed to parse a markdown-formatted text and extract sections labeled as Question and Answer, converting them into a tuple of strings. Each section's content is concatenated into a single string with spaces separating different lines' contents. Each line's extra leading or trailing spaces are stripped for cleanliness.","status":200,"tokens":[349,619],"elapsed":30.550036875,"cost":0.02206,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1382376614,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
