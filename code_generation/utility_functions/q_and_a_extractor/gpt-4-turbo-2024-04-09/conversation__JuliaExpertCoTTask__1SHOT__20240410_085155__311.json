Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Solution Approach\n\n### Step 1: Think through your approach step by step\n- Split the given markdown content based on lines to isolate each line of text.\n- Use looping and string matching to identify the lines that begin with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Extract all lines that follow `# Question` until you reach either `# Answer` or the end of the markdown, storing them as `question`.\n- Similarly, extract all lines that follow `# Answer` until the end of the markdown or until another section starts, storing them as `answer`.\n- Ensure that the extracted `question` and `answer` texts have leading and trailing whitespaces, including newlines, removed.\n\n### Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n- Define the function `q_and_a_extractor` which takes in `md`, the markdown content.\n- Implement string manipulation techniques mentioned above to gather the `question` and `answer`.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n- Implement the function as described, making sure all cases are handled properly.\n\n### Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n- Test the solution with different `md` inputs to see if it extracts the `question` and `answer` correctly.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.splitlines()\n    capture = False\n    mode = None  # can be 'question' or 'answer'\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            capture = True\n            mode = 'question'\n            continue  # skip the 'Question' heading\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            capture = True\n            mode = 'answer'\n            continue  # skip the 'Answer' heading\n        \n        if line.startswith('#') and line not in ['# Question', '# Answer']:\n            capture = False  # stop capturing if another section starts\n            continue\n        \n        if capture:\n            if mode == 'question':\n                question.append(line)\n            elif mode == 'answer':\n                answer.append(line)\n    \n    # Join the collected lines and strip any residual whitespaces\n    final_question = '\\n'.join(question).strip()\n    final_answer = '\\n'.join(answer).strip()\n    \n    return (final_question, final_answer)\n\n# Sample markdown input\nmd_example = \"\"\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the function with the provided markdown\nq_and_a_extractor(md_example)\n```\n\nThis code properly defines the `q_and_a_extractor` function and uses string manipulation methods to identify the question and answer sections and extract them effectively. After implementing the function, test it with the provided markdown data.","status":200,"tokens":[208,568],"elapsed":12.838028833,"cost":0.019119999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2066723223,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
