[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting questions and answers from markdown-formatted text, I'll follow these outlined steps:\n\n1. Separate the content based on header markers specifically `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the content just after these markers until the next header or the end of the document.\n3. Clean the extracted content by trimming leading and trailing whitespaces and newlines.\n4. Return the results as a tuple containing the question and answer texts.\n\nThis can be achieved by processing the text line by line, searching for our specific headers, and capturing content accordingly. Using start flags when headers are found and capturing the subsequent lines until another flag or header is found will enable efficient extraction.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    capturing_question = false\n    capturing_answer = false\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n\n    # Constants for markdown headers\n    question_header = \"# Question\"\n    answer_header = \"# Answer\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        trimmed_line = strip(line)\n        \n        # Check if we encounter any headers\n        if startswith(trimmed_line, question_header)\n            capturing_question = true\n            capturing_answer = false\n            continue  # skip the header line\n        elseif startswith(trimmed_line, answer_header)\n            capturing_question = false\n            capturing_answer = true\n            continue  # skip the header line\n        end\n\n        # Capture content based on current mode\n        if capturing_question\n            push!(question, trimmed_line)\n        elseif capturing_answer\n            push!(answer, trimmed_line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join the collected lines and strip for clean content as Tuple\n    (join(question, \"\\n\") |> strip, join(answer, \"\\n\") |> strip)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown by lines, iterates through them, and toggles capturing modes based on which section (Question or Answer) the parser currently is in. It assembles the respective content and returns a tuple with both question and answer appropriately stripped of any excess whitespaces or newlines. Using Julia's efficient control structure and string handling functions, this function should be clear, performant, and in line with good Julia practices.","status":200,"tokens":[350,461],"elapsed":14.865105291,"cost":0.01733,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":855974769,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
