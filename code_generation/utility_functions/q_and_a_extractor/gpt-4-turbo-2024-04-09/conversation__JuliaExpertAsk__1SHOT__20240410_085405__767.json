Ensure that at any moment, only one flag (`inside_question` or `inside_answer`) is true.\n3. **Content accumulation**: If `inside_question` is true, append the text to `question_content`. If `inside_answer` is true, append the text to `answer_content`.\n4. **Cleanup**: Once all lines are processed, strip any excess whitespace or newlines from both the `question_content` and `answer_content`.\n5. **Return tuple**: Return the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[126,450],"elapsed":14.674394125,"cost":0.01476,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":806299185,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
