[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract text from markdown sections denoted by `# Question` and `# Answer` in the given string `md`, follow these steps using Julia:\n\n1. **Identify Section Boundaries**: Look for the lines beginning with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Markdown uses `#` for headings, so these labels will mark the start of the relevant sections.\n2. **Extract Contents**: After identifying the titles for \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, the content can be extracted by reading lines until the next heading is encountered or until the end of the string.\n3. **Clean Data**: Remove any excess whitespace or newline characters from the beginning and end of the extracted content.\n\nTo accomplish this:\n- Parse through the given markdown string line by line.\n- Use a simple state machine logic to track whether you're within a Question section or an Answer section.\n- Capture the text for these sections accordingly.\n- Ensure the implementation is robust against varying markdown structures like additional text or headings that might be present.\n\nThe function will be implemented in Julia utilizing string manipulation and basic file parsing techniques for clarity and performance.\n\nNow, let's implement the function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split markdown into lines\n    question = []  # to store question section lines\n    answer = []  # to store answer section lines\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")  # any other heading ends current section\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            push!(question, line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join lines and strip\n    question_text = strip(join(question, '\\n'))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, '\\n'))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses control flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to handle the state of being within the required sections. Each section's content is accumulated in an array which is later joined into a single string, trimmed for any extra spaces or newlines at the ends. Note the division of concerns for question and answer handling, ensuring that if future sections or additional formatting are added, modifications can be more readily managed.\n\nThis solution should accurately parse and extract the desired data from markdown inputs structured as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[350,576],"elapsed":14.014640417,"cost":0.02078,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":897752016,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
