[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I will implement a function named `q_and_a_extractor` that identifies the blocks of markdown that contain `# Question` and `# Answer` and extracts the subsequent text related to these headers.\n\nHere's the systematic approach:\n1. **Identifying Relevant Sections:**\n   - Using regular expressions to detect lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` in a given markdown string.\n   \n2. **Extracting Content:**\n   - After identifying the indices of lines where these headers are found, extract the content between `# Question` and `# Answer` for the question part, and from `# Answer` to the next major header or document end for the answer part.\n   \n3. **Cleanup:**\n   - Each extracted part should be stripped of unnecessary white spaces, especially around the content.\n\n4. **Return Format:**\n   - Function will return a tuple format `(question, answer)` after processing.\n\nThis should cover different scenarios including markdown texts with multiple sections of other names, ensuring only the segments under the specified headers are captured.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the input text into lines\n    lines = split(md, r\"\\r?\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    mode = nothing  # can be 'question', 'answer' or nil\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# \")\n            if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n                mode = 'question'\n                continue\n            elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n                mode = 'answer'\n                continue\n            else\n                mode = nothing\n            end\n        end\n        \n        if mode == 'question'\n            question *= stripped_line * \" \"\n        elseif mode == 'answer'\n            answer *= stripped_line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Trim and return the result\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n\n# Usage example for testing inside a code block (assumes markdown input as described)\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nSome introductory text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# More Information\nMore detailed text follows here.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)  # Expected to return: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis function follows the planned approach by using state-based text extraction controlled through a simple state machine toggled by markdown headers. This maintains scalability and simplicity. Note that `strip` is used to clean up both starting and accumulation of strings, ensuring the outputs are formatted according to the specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[349,562],"elapsed":13.395460167,"cost":0.02035,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1198354952,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
