Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text from the sections marked as `# Question` and `# Answer` from a markdown string:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to capture content after # Question and # Answer\n    question_pattern = r\"(?<=# Question\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n    answer_pattern   = r\"(?<=# Answer\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n    \n    # Use the regular expression to find the content\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md; keepempty = false)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md; keepempty = false)\n    \n    # Extract the text from `RegexMatch` object, remove leading and trailing spaces/newlines\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.match)\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.match)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It defines regex patterns to find all content following `# Question` or `# Answer` until another header denoted by `# ` or the end of the string.\n2. It uses `match()` function from standard Julia's `Base` to search for these patterns, ensuring all content is captured, including newlines, until the next section.\n3. If a match is found, it extracts the text and strips any leading or trailing whitespace and newline characters using `strip()`.\n4. The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer content.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n\n# Answer\nAn African or a European swallow?\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)  # Output: (\"What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\", \"An African or a European swallow?\")\n```\nThis example shows how the function correctly extracts and formats the question and answer from the given markdown string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,420],"elapsed":17.090042083,"cost":0.01386,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":62852374,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
