Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, I'll break down the steps required:\n\n1. **Parse the Text**: Identify the relevant sections (`# Question` and `# Answer`) from the markdown-formatted text.\n2. **Extract Content**: Extract the text that follows each of these headers until the next `#` which indicates a new header, or the end of string.\n3. **Format and Return**: Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces from the extracted text and return them in a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nI'll use Python's string functions and regular expressions to locate and extract the relevant question and answer sections from the given markdown.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the function `q_and_a_extractor` using the identified steps.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Define regular expressions to capture text under Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?:\\n#|$)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?:\\n#|$)\"\n    \n    # Find matches for the patterns\n    question_match = re.search(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = re.search(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the content and strip unnecessary white spaces\n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else \"\"\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else \"\"\n    \n    # Return the stripped question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example application (testing the function)\nexample_md = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(example_md))\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates extracting the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" from a given markdown content using regular expressions and minimal string manipulation. Regular expressions are used for robust matching, including potential occurrences of similar patterns, and `strip()` cleans up the final strings by removing unwanted whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[208,404],"elapsed":9.685764917,"cost":0.0142,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-166773050,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
