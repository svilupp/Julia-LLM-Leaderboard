[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can approach it by identifying specific sections labeled '# Question' and '# Answer' in the provided markdown text. We'll extract the corresponding sections by searching for these tags and processing the content up to the next '#' indicating a new markdown section or the end of the document.\n\nHere's a detailed plan:\n1. **Input**: A markdown text `md`.\n2. **Find**: Sections beginning with `# Question` and `# Answer`, carefully extracting text until the beginning of another section or the end of the document.\n3. **Output**: A tuple containing both the extracted question and answer text without leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n\nTo achieve this:\n- Read through each line of the markdown till you find lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n- For each section, capture text until another section (new line starting with `#`) or end of file.\n  \nWe must pay extra attention to avoiding trailing spaces and newlines from our final extracted content and ensure our logic correctly identifies when one section ends and another begins.\n\nLet's implement this solution in the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    capturing = 0  # 0: not capturing, 1: capturing question, 2: capturing answer\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if starts_with(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            if capturing != 0\n                # Finish previous section\n                if capturing == 1\n                    question = strip(question)\n                elseif capturing == 2\n                    answer = strip(answer)\n                end\n            end\n            capturing = 1\n            question = \"\"\n            continue\n        elseif starts_with(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            if capturing == 1\n                question = strip(question)\n            end\n            capturing = 2\n            answer = \"\"\n            continue\n        elseif starts_with(stripped_line, \"#\") && !starts_with(stripped_line, \"# Question\") && !starts_with(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            if capturing == 1\n                question = strip(question)\n            elseif capturing == 2\n                answer = strip(answer)\n            end\n            capturing = 0\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if capturing == 1\n            question = question * \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif capturing == 2\n            answer = answer * \"\\n\" * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    if capturing == 1\n        question = strip(question)\n    elseif capturing == 2\n        answer = strip(answer)\n    end\n\n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown into lines and works through them, adjusting state as it encounters different headings. It captures text corresponding to the questions and answers and constructs the result accordingly. The approach is efficient for processing markdown text in line-by-line fashion, and relies on string manipulation and control flow inherent in Julia.\n\nNext steps would be to test this function with various markdown samples to check the correctness and handle different markdown formatting that might arise.","status":200,"tokens":[350,649],"elapsed":16.917395208,"cost":0.02297,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1542998076,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
