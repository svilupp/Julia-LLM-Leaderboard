[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem is extract text specifically from sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer` within a markdown formatted string. Our task is to locate these sections, save their contents, and return them in a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n1. First, it's necessary to parse the given markdown such that each section starting with `# Question` or `# Answer` is identified.\n2. We will extract the contents of these sections - by observing when a section starts and when the next section begins.\n3. Ending of any of these sections can be marked by a new header (anything starting with `#` which is not `##` as it could be a subsection) or the end of the input string.\n4. Extracted strings will have their leading spaces and newlines removed before returning.\n\n## Julia Code Implementation:\n\nWe will define a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that parses through the given markdown and utilizes known string manipulation functions to get the desired output.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split by newlines\n    is_question, is_answer = false, false\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n\n    # Pattern to check start of new question or answer\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            is_question = true\n            is_answer = false  # Disable answer scanning in case of new question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            is_answer = true\n            is_question = false # Disable question scanning in case of new answer\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"#\") && !startswith(line, \"##\") # Any other main header signals end of current section\n            is_question = false\n            is_answer = false\n        end\n\n        if is_question\n            if question != \"\"\n                question *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif is_answer\n            if answer != \"\"\n                answer *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe function takes a markdown string and returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer with the unnecessary spaces trimmed out. We keep track of lines related to \"Question\" and \"Answer\", using flags controlled by whether those lines start entitled headers or not.\n\nThe implementation also handles cases where there may not be any sections of interest by returning an empty string for those sections.","status":200,"tokens":[350,525],"elapsed":12.672467375,"cost":0.01925,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":166510646,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
