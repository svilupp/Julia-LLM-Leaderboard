[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To approach this problem, we'll need to extract sections from a markdown text based on headings specifically formatted with `# Question` and `# Answer`. \n\n## Plan:\n1. Understand markdown section distinction: Each section typically starts with a markdown heading like `#`. We anticipate sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n  \n2. Extract text for these sections:\n   - Start extraction at the line beginning with `# Question` and stop at the next heading which might not necessarily be `# Answer`.\n   - Start extraction for the answer at `# Answer` and stop at the next heading.\n\n3. Handle leading and trailing whitespace:\n   - Remove any leading spaces or newlines after identifying the correct portions of text for \"question\" and \"answer\".\n\n4. Implement the function using string manipulation:\n   - Split the markdown to handle each line.\n   - Use flags or indicators to check when we're within a desired section after encountering `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n\nThis breakdown keeps the implementation within Julia's capabilities, notably its efficient string operations, without resorting to external libraries.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    capture_question_text = false\n    capture_answer_text = false\n    \n    question_lines = []\n    answer_lines = []\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            capture_question_text = true\n            capture_answer_text = false\n            continue  # Skip current line with headline\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            capture_answer_text = true\n            capture_question_text = false\n            continue  # Skip current line with headline\n        elseif startswith(line, \"#\")  # Any other section header\n            capture_question_text = false\n            capture_answer_text = false\n        end\n        \n        if capture_question_text\n            push!(question_lines, line)\n        elseif capture_answer_text\n            push!(answer_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question_text = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis code strategically works through the markdown, captures the relevant sections based on flags triggered by headings, and constructs the isolated question and answer while removing extra whitespaces and managing newlines accurately.","status":200,"tokens":[349,489],"elapsed":11.659946542,"cost":0.018160000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1537663850,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
