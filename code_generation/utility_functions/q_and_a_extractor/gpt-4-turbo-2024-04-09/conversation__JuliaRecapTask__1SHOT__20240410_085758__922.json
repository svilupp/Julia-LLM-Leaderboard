[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To address the task of extracting the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from a Markdown text, we'll use the following approach:\n\n1. **Identify Sections**: Iterate through the lines of the provided Markdown `md` text, checking for lines that start with `# Question` or `# Answer` which indicate the beginning of the desired sections.\n\n2. **Capture Content**: After recognizing the start of a section, accumulate subsequent lines of text until another section starts or the text ends.\n\n3. **Format and Return**: Trim unnecessary white spaces and new lines from the start and end of each captured content. Return the results as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nThis approach leverages simple text processing without the need for complicated libraries, sticking closely to Julia's native capabilities. We'll ensure:\n- Efficient string operations.\n- Robust detection of sections even if there are minor variations like `#Question` (without space).\n- A clean and understandable code structure in Julia.\n\nLet's implement and detail this step-by-step solution in the next cell.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    reading_mode = :none  # could be :none, :question, :answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(r\"^# Question\", line)\n            reading_mode = :question\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif occursin(r\"^# Answer\", line)\n            reading_mode = :answer\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif occursin(r\"^#\", line)\n            reading_mode = :none\n        else\n            if reading_mode == :question\n                question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            elseif reading_mode == :answer\n                answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Clean up the accumulated strings (trim extra whitespace and newlines from ends)\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with a sample markdown text\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n\n# Answer\nIt depends if it's an African or a European swallow.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\n```\n\nThis simplified method uses regex matching to determine section headers and employs basic string concatenation logic to build the results, which are then cleaned and returned. This should efficiently and effectively process markdown texts as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[349,510],"elapsed":13.912667917,"cost":0.01879,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-606212064,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
