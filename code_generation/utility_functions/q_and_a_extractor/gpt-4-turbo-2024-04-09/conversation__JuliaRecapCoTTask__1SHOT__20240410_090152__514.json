[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's how we can systematically approach this:\n\n1. **Recall Useful Julia Snippets**:\n   - String operations: `findfirst`, `findnext`, `findlast`, `occursin`.\n   - Substring extraction: `SubString`.\n   - String modification: `strip`.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n    - Locate the starting positions of the sections `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n    - Identify where each section ends (typically by the start of another section or the end of the document).\n    - Extract text for each section using respective indices.\n    - Strip unnecessary spaces and newlines from the extracted strings.\n    - Return the clean extracted texts as a tuple.\n\n3. **Double-check Solution**:\n    - Ensure substrings are correctly sliced.\n    - Verify creation of output tuple.\n    - Test edge cases like missing sections, closely named sections, or sections with no content.\n\nThe Julia features suitable for this algorithm include string searching methods like `findfirst` and substring extraction using slicing.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Finding indexes of Question and Answer sections\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Determining the end indexes of each section\n    if question_start !== nothing\n        question_end = findnext(r\"^#\", md, nextind(md, last(question_start)))\n    end\n    if answer_start !== nothing\n        answer_end = findnext(r\"^#\", md, nextind(md, last(answer_start)))\n    end\n    \n    # Extracting and cleaning text for Q&A\n    question_text = question_start !== nothing ? strip(SubString(md, nextind(md, last(question_start)), question_end == nothing ? end : prevind(md, question_end))) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_start !== nothing ? strip(SubString(md, nextind(md, last(answer_start)), answer_end == nothing ? end : prevind(md, answer_end))) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use regex-pattern `r\"^#\"` to find the start of any subsequent markdown headers following the sections of interest, ensuring that sections are terminated properly.\n- `strip` function is utilized to clean any leading and trailing whitespace and newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[350,518],"elapsed":15.275219541,"cost":0.01904,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1175547193,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
