The expected output is a tuple containing the extracted text for these sections `(question, answer)` with any leading spaces or newlines removed.\n\n## Plan\n- Use regular expression to capture the contents from `# Question` and `# Answer` sections separately.\n- First, get all the content present after `# Question` heading (including nested headings if exist).\n- Next, capture all the content immediately after the `# Answer` heading.\n- Each capture should clean the extracted result to remove extraneous spaces or newlines.\n- Finally, make the appropriate tuples from the processed text and return.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n```julia\nusing Base: match\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Patterns to match headings and their contents\n    question_pattern = r\"(?s)^\\# Question\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\s*\\n|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"(?s)^\\# Answer\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\s*\\n|$)\"\n    \n    # Match the patterns within the markdown text\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the capture groups if matches were found\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Testing function\nexample_md = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(example_md)\n```\n\nWe are handling possible cases of no matches using conditional evaluation (`!== nothing`) and stripping any extra spaces or newlines. The use of `(?s)` in the regex patterns allows `.` to match newlines, essential for capturing multiline texts in the `Question` and `Answer` sections.","status":200,"tokens":[208,426],"elapsed":10.679573208,"cost":0.01486,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1180311547,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
