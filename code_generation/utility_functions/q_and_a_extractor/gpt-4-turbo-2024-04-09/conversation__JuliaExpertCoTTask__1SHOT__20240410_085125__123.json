The markdown format typically uses `#` to indicate headings, so these strings can serve as delimiters.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Sections**: After identifying the beginning of the question and answer sections, the next job will be to extract text under these headers.\n\n3. **Formatting**: Strip any leading or trailing spaces/newlines from the text extracted in the question and answer sections.\n\n4. **Output**: Return the extracted text in a tuple `(question, answer)` format.\n\nNow, I will write a function `q_and_a_extractor(md)` that follows this approach using Python string operations.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    import re\n    \n    # Regular expressions to find sections marked 'Question' and 'Answer'\n    question_regex = r'# Question\\n(.*?)(\\n#|$)'\n    answer_regex = r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(\\n#|$)'\n    \n    # Search for the question and answer using the regex patterns\n    question_search = re.search(question_regex, md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer_search = re.search(answer_regex, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Extract the text, and strip it of leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question = question_search.group(1).strip() if question_search else \"\"\n    answer = answer_search.group(1).strip() if answer_search else \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example use:\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"))\n```\nThe output should be the tuple:\n```\n('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```\nThis function applies regular expressions to both identify the sections and extract the text while handling any surrounding whitespace or newlines efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[208,407],"elapsed":11.177535166,"cost":0.01429,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":111297706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
