[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To address the given task of extracting text from sections marked as `# Question` and `# Answer` in a markdown-formatted text, we can take the following approach using Julia:\n\n1. **Read and Split the Document**: Split the markdown text based on newline characters to segregate the text into individual lines.\n\n2. **Identify Sections Using Markers**:\n    - As the sections of interest are defined by specific headers starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, we can loop through the split markdown lines to identify where these headers start.\n    - We'll need to track whether we're currently inside a question or answer section.\n    \n3. **Extract Relevant Text**:\n    - Use two buffers, one for accumulating lines related to the question and another for the answer.\n    - Based on the current section identified, append lines of text to the respective buffer.\n\n4. **Cleaning and Formatting**:\n    - For both the question and answer buffers, strip any leading and trailing whitespace or newline characters to clean up the text.\n    \n5. **Return Result**:\n    - Output the contents of both buffers in a tuple format `(question, answer)`.\n\n**Julia Functions and Structures**:\n- Utilize string functions like `strip`, `startswith` to clean and identify headers.\n- Control structures like `if`, `elseif`, elements like arrays and tuples will be useful in manipulation and storage of data.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    collecting_question = false\n    collecting_answer = false\n    question_buffer = []\n    answer_buffer = []\n    \n    for line in lines\n        trimmed_line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(trimmed_line, \"# Question\")\n            collecting_question = true\n            collecting_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(trimmed_line, \"# Answer\")\n            collecting_answer = true\n            collecting_question = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(trimmed_line, \"#\")\n            # encountering any other heading, stop collecting\n            collecting_question = false\n            collecting_answer = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if collecting_question\n            push!(question_buffer, line)\n        elseif collecting_answer\n            push!(answer_buffer, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question_text = strip(join(question_buffer, '\\n'))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer_buffer, '\\n'))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function primarily controls the logic flow using flags to identify when sections begin and end, adjusting the collection procedure accordingly, and finally, it constructs and returns the cleaned-up text in tuple form. It effectively processes Markdown to extract the desired structured text segments.","status":200,"tokens":[350,555],"elapsed":14.64748875,"cost":0.02015,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1531793281,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
