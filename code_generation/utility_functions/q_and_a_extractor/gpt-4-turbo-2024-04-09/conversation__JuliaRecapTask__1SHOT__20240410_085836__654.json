[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, the main steps in Julia include:\n1. Splitting the given Markdown text into lines.\n2. Iteratively scanning through these lines to locate the sections that begin with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extracting the content of these sections by accumulating lines until another section starting with `#` is encountered or the document ends.\n4. Removing any leading spaces and newlines from the captured question and answer.\n5. Structuring the extracted question and answer into a tuple.\n\nKey points observed in Julia:\n- Usage of string functions like `startswith()`, `strip()` to handle formatting.\n- The use of `for` loops to iterate through lines, and simple checks to flag entering and exiting relevant sections.\n\nThis approach focuses heavily on proper extraction and formatting as per markdown conventions.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split text into lines\n    mode = nothing  # Track the current mode (Question, Answer, or nil)\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            mode = \"question\"\n            question = []  # Reset to avoid capturing previous unneeded lines\n            continue  # Skip processing this line further\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            mode = \"answer\"\n            answer = []  # Reset to avoid capturing previous unneeded lines\n            continue  # Skip processing this line further\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\") && stripped_line != \"# Question\" && stripped_line != \"# Answer\"\n            mode = nothing  # Changing to other section\n        end\n        \n        if mode == \"question\"\n            push!(question, line)\n        elseif mode == \"answer\"\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces/newlines\n    formatted_question = strip(join(question, '\\n'))\n    formatted_answer = strip(join(answer, '\\n'))\n    \n    return (formatted_question, formatted_answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function now handles correctly extracting question and answer sections, including dealing with potential shifts between sections or malformed markdown. It avoids capturing lines not in question or answer sections (`mode = nothing`), and cleans up the output before returning.","status":200,"tokens":[349,486],"elapsed":11.942299791,"cost":0.018070000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1638059235,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
