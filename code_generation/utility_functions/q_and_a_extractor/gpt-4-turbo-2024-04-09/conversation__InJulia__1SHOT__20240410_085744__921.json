[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that will perform the task of extracting texts under headers `# Question` and `# Answer` from a given markdown-formatted string. The function will return a tuple with the question text and the answer text as its elements.\n\nThe function uses regular expressions to find the sections of the markdown that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. It assumes that any section starts with a `#` at the beginning of a line and goes until the start of the next section marked similarly or the end of the string.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Regex to find the sections under '# Question' and '# Answer'\n    question_regex = r\"(?mi)^#\\s+Question\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\s*#\\s|\\z)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?mi)^#\\s+Answer\\s*\\n(.*?)(?=\\n\\s*#\\s|\\z)\"\n    \n    # Use regex to extract question and answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extracting texts, stripping leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nSuppose you have the following markdown formatted string:\n\n```markdown\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Further Information\nFrance is in Europe.\n```\n\nYou can call the function `q_and_a_extractor` with this markdown:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Further Information\nFrance is in Europe.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion_and_answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(question_and_answer)  # Output will be: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis function will correctly extract and return the question and answer texts. The function uses regex lookahead to ensure it captures up to a new section marked by `#` or the end of the input string, whichever comes first. It also handles cases where the Question or Answer section is not present by returning an empty string for the respective missing section.","status":200,"tokens":[91,521],"elapsed":12.323895292,"cost":0.016540000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1622575569,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
