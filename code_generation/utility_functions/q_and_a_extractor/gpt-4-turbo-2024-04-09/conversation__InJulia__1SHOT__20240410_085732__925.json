If a header (`# Question` or `# Answer`) is found, `capture_mode` is set appropriately.\n- Depending on the `capture_mode`, the function appends lines to either `question` or `answer`. Newlines are preserved where necessary.\n- After the loop, leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from `question` and `answer`.\n- It returns a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Some Initial Text\n\nIrrelevant introduction.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth?\n\nMore details can be added here, including formulas.\n\n# Answer\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.81 m/sÂ².\n\nThis is considered a standard value.\n\n# Other Information\n\nMore text here.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract question and answer\nqa = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(qa)\n```\n\nThis function will properly extract and report the `Question` and `Answer` sections.","status":200,"tokens":[91,599],"elapsed":15.04914275,"cost":0.01888,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1904540594,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
