It then iterates over each line checking for `# Question` or `# Answer` tags to determine what content to gather. It concatenates relevant lines into the `question` or `answer` variable, eventually returning both in a tuple, suitably stripped of excess whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[126,290],"elapsed":7.914998458,"cost":0.00996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-57824493,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
