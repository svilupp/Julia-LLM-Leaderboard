Using Python's string manipulation functions to first separate text based on these unique markers will allow for efficient extraction.\n2. **Cleanup**: After extracting the two parts (question and answer), I will clean them of any unnecessary whitespace or newline characters using Python's string strip method.\n3. **Return**: Once extracted and cleaned, these sections will be returned as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nBy following these steps, the function will handle the provided markdown text and extract the required information systematically.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Splitting the markdown to identify questions and answers\n    parts = md.split(\"# \")\n    \n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    for part in parts:\n        if part.startswith(\"Question\"):\n            question = part[len(\"Question\"):].strip()\n        elif part.startswith(\"Answer\"):\n            answer = part[len(\"Answer\"):].strip()\n    \n    # Return the extracted question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"))\n```\n\nThis function should correctly print the tuple `(What is the capital of France?, The capital of France is Paris.)` based on the supplied markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[208,320],"elapsed":7.874853292,"cost":0.011680000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2097472966,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
