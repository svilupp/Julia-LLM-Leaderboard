[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The steps below outline how to solve the problem with Julia:\n\n1. **Recall Julia Snippets Useful for This Task**:\n    - Usage of string operations: `findnext`, `findprev`, for searching specific substrings within a text.\n    - String manipulation functions: `strip` to clean unwanted whitespace and newlines.\n    - Knowledge on handling arrays and strings.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n    - Locate the start index for \"Question\" using `# Question` and similarly for \"Answer\" using `# Answer`.\n    - Extract the substring starting from each found index up to the next section, or until the end of the document.\n    - Clean and format each section to remove additional markdown structures or excessive whitespaces.\n    - Return the extracted and cleaned \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections as a tuple.\n\n3. **Verify The Solution**:\n    - Test the function with various markdown structures to ensure it extracts the information accurately and formats it correctly.\n\nThe implemented function must handle cases where the sections may have additional markdown or textual content after the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers, adapting to variations in spacing and text arrangement.\n\nWe will implement this in the Julia programming language.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation of the function described.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the markers for the start of the Question and Answer sections\n    question_start = findnext(\"## Question\", md, 1)\n    answer_start = findnext(\"## Answer\", md, 1)\n    \n    # Handle the case where the section markers are not found\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Determine the end of the Question and Answer sections\n    question_end = findnext(\"##\", md, nextind(md, question_start[2]))  # Search for next header\n    answer_end = findnext(\"##\", md, nextind(md, answer_start[2]))      # Search for next header\n\n    question_end = question_end === nothing ? lastindex(md) : prevind(md, question_end[1])\n    answer_end = answer_end === nothing ? lastindex(md) : prevind(md, answer_end[1])\n\n    # Extract the content\n    question_content = strip(md[nextind(md, question_start[2]) : question_end])\n    answer_content = strip(md[nextind(md, answer_start[2]) : answer_end])\n\n    # Return the formatted outputs\n    return (question_content, answer_content)\nend\n```\n\nThis function should efficiently extract the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" content from provided markdown while keeping focus on clean and minimal string manipulation based on the markdown structure. Considerations for the locations of sections and possible configurations have been addressed in this design.","status":200,"tokens":[350,606],"elapsed":17.069011667,"cost":0.02168,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1383722864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
