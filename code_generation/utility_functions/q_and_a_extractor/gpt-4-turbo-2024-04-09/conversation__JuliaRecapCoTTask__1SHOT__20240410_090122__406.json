[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, I will implement the solution in Julia. The main steps will revolve around parsing the markdown for specific section headers and extracting the corresponding text. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Headers**: Recognize sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Since markdown uses `#` for headers, searching for these particular strings will allow us to pinpoint the content we're interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Content**: For each of the identified sections, extract text until the beginning of the next section (denoted by the next `#`) or the end of the document.\n\n3. **Clean Up Content**: Before returning the extracted text, trim leading and trailing whitespaces and newlines.\n\n4. **Return Results**: Format the results into a tuple of the form `(question_text, answer_text)`.\n\nTo implement this in Julia:\n- Use Julia's string manipulation functions like `findnext`, `startswith`, and slice operations.\n- Handle edge cases such as sections that are not followed by any subsequent section headers.\n\nThe function I'll be crafting is named `q_and_a_extractor`. Let's move forward with the solution.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")  # Split the markdown into lines\n    question = nothing  # Placeholders for question and answer\n    answer = nothing\n \n    collecting_question = false  # Flags to keep track of which section we're in\n    collecting_answer = false\n \n    question_parts = []\n    answer_parts = []\n \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if collecting_question\n                # If already collecting question and see another header, ignore\n                continue\n            end\n\n            collecting_question = true  # Start collecting question text\n            collecting_answer = false  # Ensure not collecting answer\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            collecting_question = false\n            collecting_answer = true  # Start collecting answer text\n\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# \") && (collecting_question || collecting_answer)\n            # A new section starts, stop collecting previous section\n            collecting_question = false\n            collecting_answer = false\n        else\n            # Append lines to appropriate parts based on flags\n            if collecting_question\n                push!(question_parts, line)\n            elseif collecting_answer\n                push!(answer_parts, line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n \n    # Cleanup text, trim spaces and join lines\n    question = length(question_parts) > 0 ? strip(join(question_parts, \"\\n\")) : \"\"\n    answer = length(answer_parts) > 0 ? strip(join(answer_parts, \"\\n\")) : \"\"\n \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function has strategically been constructed considering Julia's syntax and data management patterns. It effectively extracts the required portions from the markdown text while ensuring the outputs are clean and appropriate.","status":200,"tokens":[350,599],"elapsed":15.315285875,"cost":0.02147,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-409461595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
