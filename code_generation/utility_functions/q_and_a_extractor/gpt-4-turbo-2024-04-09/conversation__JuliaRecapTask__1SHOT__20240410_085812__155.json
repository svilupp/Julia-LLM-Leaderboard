[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to parse markdown text to extract sections labeled \"Question\" and \"Answer\". The basic approach includes:\n\n1. **Reading Markdown Content**: This content might have various sections, and our interest specifically lies in those starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Extracting the Desired Sections**: We'll locate these markers, extract the content immediately following them up to the start of the next section or the end of the document.\n3. **Returning Result**: Format and return the content as `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo implement this:\n- Split the markdown document by lines.\n- Traverse each line to identify the ones starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Capture lines following these until another header (starting with `#`) or end of the document is reached.\n- Return trimmed results.\n\nThe following constraints and considerations will guide the solution:\n- Markdown headers `# Question` and `# Answer` can have optional leading spaces.\n- Section content extraction should be robust against various markdown structure deviations.\n\nThis approach assumes there's only one \"Question\" and one \"Answer\" section in the document. If there are multiple, only the first ones encountered will be captured.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    num_lines = length(lines)\n    \n    capturing_question = false\n    capturing_answer = false\n    question_lines = []\n    answer_lines = []\n    \n    # Regex to detect any markdown header (level 1-6)\n    header_regex = r\"^ *#+ \"\n\n    for (index, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        line_strip = strip(line)\n        # Check if line is the start of \"Question\" or \"Answer\" sections\n        if startswith(line_strip, \"# Question\")\n            capturing_question = true\n            capturing_answer = false\n            empty!(question_lines)\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line_strip, \"# Answer\")\n            capturing_answer = true\n            capturing_question = false\n            empty!(answer_lines)\n            continue\n        elseif occursin(header_regex, line) && line_strip != \"# Question\" && line_strip != \"# Answer\"\n            # Any other header stops the current capture\n            capturing_question = false\n            capturing_answer = false\n        end\n        \n        # Capture the lines appropriately\n        if capturing_question\n            push!(question_lines, line)\n        elseif capturing_answer\n            push!(answer_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    # Combine lines and strip outer whitespace\n    question_text = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function identifies the relevant sections based on headers, collects content until another section is reached or the document ends, and ensures the returned text is stripped of excess spaces and newlines for cleanliness.","status":200,"tokens":[349,595],"elapsed":14.077379958,"cost":0.02134,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":954619456,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
