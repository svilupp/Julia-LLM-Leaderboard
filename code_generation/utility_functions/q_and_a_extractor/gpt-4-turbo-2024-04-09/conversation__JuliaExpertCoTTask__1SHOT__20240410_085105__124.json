Split the input markdown text by lines.\n2. Iterate over these lines to detect sections that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n3. Capture the content following these specific headers using a flag-based approach.\n4. Clean and return the content.\n\nLet's proceed with this approach to implement the solution.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = [], []\n    capture_mode = nothing  # Can be :question or :answer\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped, \"# Question\")\n            capture_mode = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped, \"# Answer\")\n            capture_mode = :answer\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped, \"#\")  # Start of a new section\n            capture_mode = nothing\n        end\n        \n        if capture_mode == :question\n            push!(question, stripped)\n        elseif capture_mode == :answer\n            push!(answer, stripped)\n        end\n    end\n\n    question_content = strip(join(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_content = strip(join(answer, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question_content, answer_content)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a control flag `capture_mode` to determine when to start and stop recording lines for the question and the answer. It cleanly strips and ouputs both sections as required by the task.","status":200,"tokens":[208,402],"elapsed":17.555354083,"cost":0.01414,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-397921427,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
