Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, here's the approach:\n\n1. **Identify Blocks**: Use sections identified by the '# Question' and '# Answer' headers within the markdown text to split and extract the relevant information.\n2. **Cleanup**: Clean up each extracted section to remove unwanted whitespace or newline characters.\n3. **Return Data**: Return the cleaned sections in a tuple format.\n\nI will create the function `q_and_a_extractor` to implement these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input text into two parts on the basis of the '# Answer' heading\n    question_part, answer_part = split(md, \"\\n# Answer\\n\", limit=2)\n    \n    # Extract the question text by removing the '# Question' tag\n    question = replace(question_part, \"\\n# Question\\n\" => \"\")\n    \n    # Clean up whitespace and new lines\n    question = strip(question) \n    answer = strip(answer_part)\n    \n    # Return the cleaned question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Testing the function\nq_and_a_extractor(md_example)\n```\n\nThis function reads the markdown text, partitions it appropriately at the headers, strips unnecessary characters and spaces, and captures the desired text between identified marks. It then returns the question and answer in a tuple. The example provided matches the structure assumed in the split commands. Adjustments could be made to handle other variations in markdown formatting, such as different spacing or tabbing, by modifying the `replace` and `strip` calls.","status":200,"tokens":[208,344],"elapsed":8.230928708,"cost":0.012400000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":113713854,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
