[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll use a straightforward approach of parsing the markdown-formatted text:\n1. Identify the beginning of question and answer sections marked by \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n2. Extract the content immediately following each of these headings.\n3. Ensure to strip any leading or trailing white spaces/newlines.\n\nLet's summarize the steps:\n- Read the markdown text.\n- Find the beginning and end positions of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" sections.\n- Extract the content between those headings and the subsequent headings or the end of the text.\n- Strip out excess whitespace.\n\nWe will use built-in string operations like `find` and slicing to achieve this. This is efficient and straightforward given the problem constraints.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Identifiers for sections\n    question_tag = \"# Question\"\n    answer_tag = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    # Locate the positions of these tags\n    start_question = findfirst(occursin(question_tag), md)\n    start_answer = findfirst(occursin(answer_tag), md)\n\n    if start_question === nothing || start_answer === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\") # Return empty if any tag not found\n    end\n    \n    # Move the `start` index to after the tags and newlines\n    start_question_end = start_question + length(question_tag)\n    start_answer_end = start_answer + length(answer_tag)\n\n    # Find the beginning of the next line after tags\n    start_question_end = first((findfirst(isequal('\\n'), md[start_question_end:end]) + start_question_end - 1) - 1)\n    start_answer_end = first((findfirst(isequal('\\n'), md[start_answer_end:end]) + start_answer_end - 1) - 1)\n    \n    # If either indices are nothing, we have malformed markdown with no newline following the tag\n    if start_question_end === nothing || start_answer_end === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract until the next heading or the end of the text\n    end_question = findfirst(occursin(\"#\"), md[start_question_end+1:end])\n    end_answer = findfirst(occursin(\"#\"), md[start_answer_end+1:end])\n\n    question_text = end_question === nothing ? md[start_question_end+1:end] : md[start_question_end+1:start_question_end + end_question - 1]\n    answer_text = end_answer === nothing ? md[start_answer_end+1:end] : md[start_answer_end+1:start_answer_end + end_answer - 1]\n\n    # Strip the extracted text of external white spaces and newlines\n    question_clean = strip(question_text)\n    answer_clean = strip(answer_text)\n\n    return (question_clean, answer_clean)\nend\n```\n\nThis function is structured for easy debugging and follows a step-by-step approach, preserving clarity for future modifications or extensions. It checks for malformed markdown (missing newline after headers, etc.) and handles empty sections by returning empty strings correspondingly.\n\nThe approach involves very basic string indexing and search operations which are fast and reliable for the problem's constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[349,642],"elapsed":20.004691292,"cost":0.02275,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-415248669,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
