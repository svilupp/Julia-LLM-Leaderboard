Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:\n1. **Identify Sections:** Split the input markdown text on occurrences of `# Question` and `# Answer`. This will help in separating the different sections.\n2. **Extract Content:** Once split, the text immediately following `# Question` corresponds to the question, and the text immediately following `# Answer` corresponds to the answer.\n3. **Sanitize Text:** Strip leading and trailing whitespace characters, including newline characters, from both the question and answer to ensure cleanliness.\n4. **Output Tuple:** Return a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNow, let's write the `q_and_a_extractor` function following this plan.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split using # Question as delimiter; result[2] should contain question part and onward\n    question_split = split(md, \"# Question\")\n    answer_split = split(question_split[2], \"# Answer\")  # Split the part after # Question with # Answer\n    \n    # First part from answer split is the clean question. Second part is the answer.\n    question_text = strip(answer_split[1])  # Strip to clean up the question\n    answer_text = strip(answer_split[2])    # Strip to clean up the answer\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nq_and_a_extractor(\"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\")\n```\nThis function will extract and return the formatted question and answer in a tuple. The example provided would output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\").","status":200,"tokens":[208,344],"elapsed":8.966643917,"cost":0.012400000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1692428525,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
