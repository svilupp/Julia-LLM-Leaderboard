X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Splits the markdown text into lines.\n2. Identifies the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extracts the text following these headers until the next header or end of the text.\n4. Strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question_lines = []\n    answer_lines = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif in_question\n            push!(question_lines, stripped_line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer_lines, stripped_line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\nLet's test the function with a sample markdown text to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some Header\nThis is some intro text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Header\nMore text here.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis should confirm that the function correctly extracts and strips the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n\n### Final Code\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question_lines = []\n    answer_lines = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif in_question\n            push!(question_lines, stripped_line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer_lines, stripped_line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some Header\nThis is some intro text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Header\nMore text here.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should give us the correct output and confirm that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[402,1014],"elapsed":21.004527958,"cost":0.010332000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-741135040,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
