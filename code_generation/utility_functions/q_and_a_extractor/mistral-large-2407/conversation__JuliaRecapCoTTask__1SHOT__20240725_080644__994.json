[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting text from markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**:\n   - String manipulation functions like `split`, `strip`, and `startswith`.\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching.\n   - Basic control structures like `if-elseif-else` and `for`.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - We'll write a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text as input.\n   - We'll split the text into lines and iterate through them to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - Extract the text following these headers until the next header or the end of the text.\n   - Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**:\n   - Ensure that the function correctly identifies and extracts the text from the specified sections.\n   - Verify that the extracted text is stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question_lines = []\n    answer_lines = []\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"#\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif in_question\n            push!(question_lines, strip(line))\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer_lines, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some Header\nSome text before the question.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Header\nSome text after the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the Text**:\n   - The input markdown text is split into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n\n2. **Iterating Through Lines**:\n   - We iterate through each line to check if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n   - We use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we are currently in the question or answer section.\n\n3. **Extracting Text**:\n   - If a line starts with `# Question`, we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If a line starts with `# Answer`, we set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - If a line starts with any other header (`#`), we set both flags to `false`.\n   - If we are in the question section (`in_question` is `true`), we add the line to `question_lines`.\n   - If we are in the answer section (`in_answer` is `true`), we add the line to `answer_lines`.\n\n4. **Joining and Stripping**:\n   - We join the collected lines for the question and answer sections using `join(question_lines, \"\\n\")` and `join(answer_lines, \"\\n\")`.\n   - We strip any leading spaces and newlines from the joined text using `strip`.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**:\n   - The function returns a tuple containing the extracted and stripped question and answer.\n\nThis solution ensures that the text is correctly extracted and formatted as required.","status":200,"tokens":[404,955],"elapsed":19.337820708,"cost":0.009807,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1751401804,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
