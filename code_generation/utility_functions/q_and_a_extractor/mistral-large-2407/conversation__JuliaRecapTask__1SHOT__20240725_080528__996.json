[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here are some useful Julia snippets:\n\n- String manipulation: `strip`, `split`, `replace`\n- Regular expressions: `r\"pattern\"`, `match`, `eachmatch`\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to write a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections from a markdown-formatted text.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Use regular expressions to find the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n2. Extract the text following these sections until the next section or the end of the text.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the regex patterns for the sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"s\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"s\n\n    # Extract the text for the Question section\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.captures[1])\n\n    # Extract the text for the Answer section\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's test the function with a few examples to ensure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\n# Test case 1\nmd1 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult1 = q_and_a_extractor(md1)\nprintln(result1)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n\n# Test case 2\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Some Other Section\nThis is some other text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\n2 + 2 is 4.\n\n# Another Section\nMore text here.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult2 = q_and_a_extractor(md2)\nprintln(result2)  # Expected output: (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"2 + 2 is 4.\")\n\n# Test case 3\nmd3 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nNo answer provided.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult3 = q_and_a_extractor(md3)\nprintln(result3)  # Expected output: (\"No answer provided.\", \"\")\n```\n\nThe function should correctly extract the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections and return them as a tuple. The regular expressions ensure that we capture the text until the next section or the end of the text, and the `strip` function removes any leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[402,826],"elapsed":39.286169166,"cost":0.00864,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":913527187,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
