It uses flags to determine whether the current line is part of the `# Question` or `# Answer` section. The extracted text is concatenated into the `question` and `answer` variables, which are then stripped of leading and trailing whitespace before being returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[95,474],"elapsed":23.854002458,"cost":0.0045509999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1729609122,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
