Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts text from the markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`, and returns them as a tuple `(question, answer)`. The function also strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines for easier processing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Flags to indicate if we are in the Question or Answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if stripped_line == \"# Question\"\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif stripped_line == \"# Answer\"\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function processes the markdown text line by line, identifying the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections and extracting the corresponding text. It then strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text before returning it as a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function with the provided example or any other markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[95,455],"elapsed":9.804272125,"cost":0.004379999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":98014277,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
