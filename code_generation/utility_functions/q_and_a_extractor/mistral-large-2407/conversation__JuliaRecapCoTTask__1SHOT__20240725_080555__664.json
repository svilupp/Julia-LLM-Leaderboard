X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's break down the task systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nFor this task, we need to:\n1. Parse the markdown text to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text following these headings.\n3. Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the extracted text in a tuple.\n\nUseful Julia snippets:\n- String manipulation functions: `split`, `strip`, `startswith`.\n- Regular expressions for pattern matching.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nHere is the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Flags to indicate if we are in the Question or Answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    # Iterate through each line\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's test the function with a sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introduction.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\nThis is the conclusion.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis should correctly extract the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections and return them as a tuple.\n\n### Special Instructions\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided by the user, they should be incorporated into the solution. However, since no specific instructions were given in the provided text, the above solution should suffice.","status":200,"tokens":[404,658],"elapsed":14.800771041,"cost":0.007134,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2024034698,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
