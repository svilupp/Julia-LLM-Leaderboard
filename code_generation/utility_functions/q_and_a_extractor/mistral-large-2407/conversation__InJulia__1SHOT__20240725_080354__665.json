Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text from the markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer` and returns them as a tuple `(question, answer)`. The function also strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Flags to indicate if we are in the question or answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    # Iterate over each line\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if stripped_line == \"# Question\"\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif stripped_line == \"# Answer\"\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line to identify the sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`. It uses flags to determine when it is within these sections and appends the stripped lines to the respective `question` or `answer` strings. Finally, it strips any leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning the result as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[95,477],"elapsed":10.376463042,"cost":0.004578,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-194072316,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
