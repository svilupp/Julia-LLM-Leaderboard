[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts text from markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`, and returns them as a tuple `(question, answer)` with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    question_end = answer_start - 1\n    answer_end = findnext(\"\\n#\", md, answer_start)\n\n    if answer_end === nothing\n        answer_end = length(md)\n    else\n        answer_end = answer_end.start - 1\n    end\n\n    question = strip(md[question_start.stop+1:question_end])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start.stop+1:answer_end])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It searches for the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text.\n2. It calculates the end positions of the question and answer sections.\n3. It extracts the text between these positions and strips any leading and trailing whitespace.\n4. It returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function with different markdown texts to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[95,412],"elapsed":8.2542035,"cost":0.003993,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":436496572,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
