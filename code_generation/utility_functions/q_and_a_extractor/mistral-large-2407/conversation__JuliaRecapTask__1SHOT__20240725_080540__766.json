[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\nTo solve this task, we'll need to:\n- Parse the markdown text to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Extract the text following these sections.\n- Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n- Return the extracted text in a tuple.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nHere's the Julia code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Initialize flags to indicate when we are in the Question or Answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if stripped_line == \"# Question\"\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif stripped_line == \"# Answer\"\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\nLet's double-check the solution by running the example provided:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function should correctly extract the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections and return them as a tuple. The leading spaces and newlines are stripped, ensuring the output is clean.","status":200,"tokens":[402,582],"elapsed":12.220225042,"cost":0.006444,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2063399657,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
