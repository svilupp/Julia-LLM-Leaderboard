[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here are some useful snippets:\n\n- **String Manipulation**: `strip`, `split`, `replace`\n- **Regular Expressions**: `r\"pattern\"`, `match`, `eachmatch`\n- **Control Structures**: `for`, `if-elseif-else`\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts text from `# Question` and `# Answer` sections in a markdown string.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Use regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text following these headers.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the extracted text as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the regular expressions for the headers\n    question_header = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.+?)(?=#|$)\"s\n    answer_header = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.+?)(?=#|$)\"s\n\n    # Extract the text following the headers\n    question_match = match(question_header, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_header, md)\n\n    # Initialize question and answer as empty strings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Check if the matches were found and extract the text\n    if question_match !== nothing\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    end\n\n    if answer_match !== nothing\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\n### Step 4: Double-check the Solution\n\nLet's double-check the solution with a few test cases:\n\n```julia\nmd1 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\nThe answer is 4.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nHow do you say 'hello' in Spanish?\n\n# Answer\nYou say 'hola'.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md1))  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md2))  # Expected output: (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"The answer is 4.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md3))  # Expected output: (\"How do you say 'hello' in Spanish?\", \"You say 'hola'.\")\n```\n\nThe function should correctly extract the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections and return it as a tuple. If the sections are not found, it should return empty strings.","status":200,"tokens":[404,811],"elapsed":20.781579583,"cost":0.008511,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-96661239,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
