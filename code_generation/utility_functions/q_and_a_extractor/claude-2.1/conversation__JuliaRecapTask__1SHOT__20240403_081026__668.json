[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It accumulates the lines into separate question and answer string arrays. Finally it joins each array into a single string and returns the tuple.\n\nSome key aspects:\n- Use `startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")` to check for section headers after removing initial whitespace \n- Use a boolean flag to track which section we are currently inside\n- Accumulate lines into array, join at end\n- Return tuple `(question, answer)`\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[362,315],"elapsed":15.26528175,"cost":0.010456,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13603,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
