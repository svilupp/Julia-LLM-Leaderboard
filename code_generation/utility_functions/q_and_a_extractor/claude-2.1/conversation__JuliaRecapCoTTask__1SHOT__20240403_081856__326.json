[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    q_lines = String[]\n    a_lines = String[]\n    in_q = false\n    in_a = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        l = strip(line)\n        if startswith(l, \"# Question\")\n            in_q = true\n            in_a = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(l, \"# Answer\")\n            in_q = false\n            in_a = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_q\n            push!(q_lines, l)\n        elseif in_a \n            push!(a_lines, l)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    q = join(q_lines, \"\\n\")\n    a = join(a_lines, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return (q, a)\nend\n```\n\nThis iterates through each line, keeping track of whether we are currently inside a Question or Answer section. It accumulates the lines into separate arrays, joins them when done, and returns the Question and Answer text as a tuple.\n\nIt handles leading whitespace by using `strip` on each line before accumulating.\n\nLet me know if any part needs more explanation! I'm happy to clarify or improve the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[363,277],"elapsed":12.046345166,"cost":0.009552,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28281,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
