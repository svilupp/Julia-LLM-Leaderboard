It uses `strip` to remove any leading whitespace, and `startswith` to check for the section headers. Finally it joins the lines and returns the question and answer.\n\nTo test:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?  \n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nWhich would return:\n\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[128,363],"elapsed":11.447327,"cost":0.009736000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29987,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
