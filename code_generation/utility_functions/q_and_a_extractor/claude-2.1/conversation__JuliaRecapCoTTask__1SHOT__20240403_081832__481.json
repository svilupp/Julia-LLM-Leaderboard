[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to extract the Question and Answer sections from the given markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    q_lines = String[]\n    a_lines = String[]\n    in_q = false\n    in_a = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            in_q = true\n            in_a = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            in_q = false\n            in_a = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_q\n            push!(q_lines, strip(line))\n        elseif in_a \n            push!(a_lines, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = join(q_lines, \" \")\n    answer = join(a_lines, \" \")\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis iterates through each line, tracking if we are currently inside a Question or Answer section. It accumulates the lines of each section in separate string arrays, strips whitespace from each line, and joins them into the final question and answer strings.\n\nIt handles leading newlines and spaces by using `strip` on each line before accumulating.\n\nLet me know if any changes are needed to fit your use case! I can update the implementation based on any special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[363,306],"elapsed":12.776836708,"cost":0.010248,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
