Finally it joins the lines and returns a tuple with the question and answer.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- Use occursin() to check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" \n- Use boolean flags collect_q and collect_a to keep track of what to collect\n- Strip out any leading whitespace to clean the extracted text\n- Join the extracted lines and return a tuple\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[224,367],"elapsed":13.973518542,"cost":0.0106,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29212,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
