Split the markdown text into lines\n2. Keep track of whether we are currently in a Question or Answer section\n3. Build up q_lines and a_lines by stripping and appending lines appropriately \n4. Join the lines and return the question and answer\n\nThis handles leading spaces and newlines by stripping each line before appending.
