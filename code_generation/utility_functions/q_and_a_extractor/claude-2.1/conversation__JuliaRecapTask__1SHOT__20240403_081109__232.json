[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= stripped * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis iterates through each line, and keeps track of whether we are currently inside a Question or Answer section using the `in_question` and `in_answer` boolean flags. It accumulates the text from each section by concatenating to the `question` and `answer` strings. Finally it returns the cleaned up strings stripped of extra whitespace.\n\nLet's verify it works on a sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some header\nHere is some intro text.\n\n# Question \nWhat is Julia?   \n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis should return:\n\n```\n(\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[362,343],"elapsed":15.627102833,"cost":0.011127999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6330,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
