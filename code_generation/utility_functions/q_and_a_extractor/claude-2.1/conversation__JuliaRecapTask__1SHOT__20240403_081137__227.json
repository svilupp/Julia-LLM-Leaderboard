[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It uses `startswith` to detect the section headers, and `strip` to remove extra whitespace. The final strings are returned in a tuple.\n\nSome key aspects:\n\n- Use an abstract string type `AbstractString` for flexibility\n- Split the input on newlines to iterate line-by-line \n- Use `startswith` to parse section headers  \n- Build up strings incrementally\n- Strip leading/trailing whitespace \n- Return tuple with question and answer\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[362,313],"elapsed":14.137325417,"cost":0.010408,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14104,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
