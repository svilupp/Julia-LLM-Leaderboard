It accumulates the extracted lines into separate string arrays, strips any leading whitespace using `strip`, and joins them into question and answer strings at the end.\n\nTo test:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?  \n\nParis is the capital and most populous city of France.\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Q: $q\")\nprintln(\"A: $a\")\n```\n\nWhich prints:\n\n```\nQ: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris. \n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[128,388],"elapsed":13.544942625,"cost":0.010336000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12419,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
