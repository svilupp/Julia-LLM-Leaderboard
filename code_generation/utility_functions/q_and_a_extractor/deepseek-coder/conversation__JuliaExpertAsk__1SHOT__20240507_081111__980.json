Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer from the markdown text:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Define the regular expressions for the question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = re.compile(r'# Question\\n(.*?)(?=# Answer|$)', re.DOTALL)\n    answer_pattern = re.compile(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=# Question|$)', re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Find the question and answer sections\n    question_match = question_pattern.search(md)\n    answer_match = answer_pattern.search(md)\n\n    # Extract the text from the question and answer sections\n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else None\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else None\n\n    return (question, answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining regular expressions that match the question and answer sections. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` to match any character including newlines. The `(.*?)` is a non-greedy match for any text, and `(?=# Answer|$)` is a positive lookahead that matches the end of the question section.\n\nThe function then searches the markdown text for these sections and extracts the text from each section. If a section is not found, the corresponding variable is set to `None`. The text is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace before being returned.","status":200,"tokens":[148,364],"elapsed":13.516802625,"cost":0.00012264,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":558244034,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
