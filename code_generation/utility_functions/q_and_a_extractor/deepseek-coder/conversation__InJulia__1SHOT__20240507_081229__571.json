[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = strip(line[11:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(line[9:end])\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text into lines, then iterating over each line. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag indicating that it's in a question section, and resets the flag for the answer section. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it does the opposite. If the line is in a question or answer section, it appends the line to the appropriate string, stripping leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that each question and answer section is separated by a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If the markdown text is not well-formed, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[107,366],"elapsed":17.826495791,"cost":0.00011746,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2013794552,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
