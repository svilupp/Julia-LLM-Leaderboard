Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then searches for this pattern in the input string and extracts the matched text, stripping any leading spaces and newlines. The same process is repeated for the answer section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section. If the text is not well-formed or if there are multiple `# Question` or `# Answer` sections, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[148,370],"elapsed":13.533451083,"cost":0.00012432,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-46682335,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
