Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that does exactly what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = line[11:end]\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = line[9:end]\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside a question section. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside an answer section. It then appends the text to the appropriate variable.\n\nThe function returns a tuple of the question and answer, with leading spaces and newlines stripped from each.","status":200,"tokens":[107,320],"elapsed":16.002415375,"cost":0.00010458,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1948935344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
