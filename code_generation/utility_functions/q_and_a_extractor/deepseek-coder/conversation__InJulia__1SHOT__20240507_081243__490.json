When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside a question section. When it encounters a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets a flag indicating that it's inside an answer section. It then appends the text to the appropriate variable. When it encounters a line that doesn't start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it assumes that it's part of the current section and appends the text to the appropriate variable. Finally, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[107,354],"elapsed":14.4391085,"cost":0.00011410000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2029629805,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
