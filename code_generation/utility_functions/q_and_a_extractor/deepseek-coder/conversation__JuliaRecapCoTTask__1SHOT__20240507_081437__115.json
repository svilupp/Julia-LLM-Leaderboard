[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Split the markdown text into sections\n    sections = re.split(r'# Question|# Answer', md)\n\n    # Filter out the sections that don't start with 'Question' or 'Answer'\n    question_and_answer_sections = [section for section in sections if section.startswith('Question') or section.startswith('Answer')]\n\n    # Extract the questions and answers\n    questions = [section.strip() for section in question_and_answer_sections if section.startswith('Question')]\n    answers = [section.strip() for section in question_and_answer_sections if section.startswith('Answer')]\n\n    # Return the questions and answers as a tuple\n    return (questions, answers)\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown text into sections based on the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers. It then filters out the sections that don't start with 'Question' or 'Answer'. The questions and answers are extracted from the remaining sections and returned as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each question is immediately followed by its corresponding answer. If the markdown text does not follow this format, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[436,313],"elapsed":13.967077959,"cost":0.00014868,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-45508457,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
