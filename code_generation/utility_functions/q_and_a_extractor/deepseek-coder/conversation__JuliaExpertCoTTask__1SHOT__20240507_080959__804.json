Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer', md, re.DOTALL).group(1).strip()\n    answer = re.search(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)$', md, re.DOTALL).group(1).strip()\n    return (question, answer)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re.search` function to find the text in the markdown sections Question and Answer. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make the `.` special character match any character including a newline. The `group(1)` function is used to get the text that was matched by the first group in the regular expression. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere is how you can use this function with the provided data:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[250,306],"elapsed":11.537922,"cost":0.00012068000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1134457878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
