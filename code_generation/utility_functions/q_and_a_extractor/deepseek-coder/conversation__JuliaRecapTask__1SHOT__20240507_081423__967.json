[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts the text in the markdown sections Question and Answer:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = strip(line[11:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(line[9:end])\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into lines and then iterating over each line. It uses the `startswith` function to check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the appropriate flag to true and starts building the question or answer string. If the line is not a question or answer, it checks which flag is true and appends the line to the appropriate string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that there is only one question and one answer per markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers, or if the markdown text is not well-formed, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[434,370],"elapsed":14.804286792,"cost":0.00016436,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1732626541,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
