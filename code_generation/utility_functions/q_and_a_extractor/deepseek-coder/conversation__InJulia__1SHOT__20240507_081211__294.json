Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that extracts the question and answer from a markdown text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            question = strip(line[11:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(line[9:end])\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. It uses the `startswith` function to check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the appropriate flag to true and starts building the question or answer string. If the line is not a question or answer, it checks which flag is true and appends the line to the appropriate string.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that there is only one question and one answer per markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers, or if the markdown text is not well-formed, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[107,367],"elapsed":16.392836083,"cost":0.00011774000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":122604926,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
