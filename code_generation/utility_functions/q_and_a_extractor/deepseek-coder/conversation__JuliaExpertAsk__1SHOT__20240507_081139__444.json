Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Define the regular expressions for the question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = re.compile(r'# Question\\n(.*?)(?=# Answer|$)', re.DOTALL)\n    answer_pattern = re.compile(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=#|$)', re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Find the question and answer sections\n    question_match = question_pattern.search(md)\n    answer_match = answer_pattern.search(md)\n\n    # If both sections are found, return them as a tuple\n    if question_match and answer_match:\n        question = question_match.group(1).strip()\n        answer = answer_match.group(1).strip()\n        return (question, answer)\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining regular expressions that match the question and answer sections. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` to match any character including newline. The `(.*?)` is a non-greedy match for any characters, and `(?=# Answer|$)` and `(?=#|$)` are positive lookaheads that match the end of the question and answer sections.\n\nThe function then searches for these sections in the markdown text. If both sections are found, it extracts the text and returns it as a tuple. If either section is not found, it returns `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[148,375],"elapsed":14.278940708,"cost":0.00012572,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1113696918,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
