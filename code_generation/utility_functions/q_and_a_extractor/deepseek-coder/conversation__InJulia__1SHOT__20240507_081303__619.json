This function uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then extracts the text following these headers.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Define regular expressions for the question and answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"^# Question\\n(.*?)(?=# Answer|$)\"sm\n    answer_regex = r\"^# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=# Question|$)\"sm\n\n    # Find the question and answer sections\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # If both question and answer sections are found, return them as a tuple\n    if !isnothing(question_match) && !isnothing(answer_match)\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return nothing\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `match` function from the `Regex` module to find the first occurrence of the regular expressions in the markdown text. The `captures` field of the match object contains the text that was captured by the parentheses in the regular expression. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text contains exactly one question and one answer section. If there are multiple question or answer sections, or if the sections are not in the correct order, the function will not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[107,400],"elapsed":19.763870125,"cost":0.00012698,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1248188032,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
