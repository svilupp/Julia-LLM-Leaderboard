Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and extracts the text under the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer text with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    question_started = false\n    answer_started = false\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines to extract question and answer\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a heading for a question\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            question_started = true\n            answer_started = false\n            # Remove the heading and leading/trailing whitespace\n            question = strip(line[14:end])\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            # If an answer is already started, it means we have a new question-answer pair\n            if answer_started\n                # Return the previous question-answer pair\n                return (question, answer)\n            end\n            answer_started = true\n            question_started = false\n            # Remove the heading and leading/trailing whitespace\n            answer = strip(line[11:end])\n        elseif question_started\n            # Append the line to the question, stripping leading/trailing whitespace\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif answer_started\n            # Append the line to the answer, stripping leading/trailing whitespace\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the last question-answer pair if present\n    if question_started\n        return (question, \"\")\n    elseif answer_started\n        return (\"\", answer)\n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question What is the capital of France?\nSome additional text that should not be included.\n\n# Answer The capital of France is Paris.\nMore text that should also not be included.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis function will extract the text immediately following the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, and it will concatenate subsequent lines until it encounters a new heading. It assumes that each question-answer pair is separated by at least one empty line. If there are multiple question-answer pairs in the input markdown, this function will only return the first pair. If you need to extract multiple pairs, you would need to modify the function to accumulate pairs in an array and return that array instead.","status":200,"tokens":[100,668],"elapsed":49.280236708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-361723600,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
