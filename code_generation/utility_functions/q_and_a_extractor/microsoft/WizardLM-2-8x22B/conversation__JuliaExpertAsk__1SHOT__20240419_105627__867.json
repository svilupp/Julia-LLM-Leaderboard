When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets the current section to `:question` and initializes the `question` string. Similarly, when it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it sets the current section to `:answer` and initializes the `answer` string. It then appends the content of the lines to the respective strings, stripping leading and trailing whitespace and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the processed question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[141,393],"elapsed":85.02702575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":401867011,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
