Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and extracts the text under the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer text with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    question_started = false\n    answer_started = false\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines to extract question and answer\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a heading indicating the start of a question\n        if occursin(r\"^# Question\\s*$\", line)\n            question_started = true\n            answer_started = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if the line is a heading indicating the start of an answer\n        if occursin(r\"^# Answer\\s*$\", line)\n            question_started = false\n            answer_started = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the question section, append the line to the question\n        if question_started\n            question *= rstrip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the answer section, append the line to the answer\n        if answer_started\n            answer *= rstrip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace and return the tuple\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Some Title\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Question\nWhat is the largest ocean on Earth?\n\n# Answer\nThe largest ocean on Earth is the Pacific Ocean.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis function will output the first question and answer pair found in the markdown text. If you need to extract multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to return a list of tuples instead. Here's how you could do that:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor_multiple(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize a list to hold the question-answer pairs\n    qa_pairs = []\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n    question_started = false\n    answer_started = false\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines to extract question and answer pairs\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a heading indicating the start of a question\n        if occursin(r\"^# Question\\s*$\", line)\n            question_started = true\n            answer_started = false\n            current_question = \"\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if the line is a heading indicating the start of an answer\n        if occursin(r\"^# Answer\\s*$\", line)\n            question_started = false\n            answer_started = true\n            current_answer = \"\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the question section, append the line to the current question\n        if question_started\n            current_question *= rstrip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the answer section, append the line to the current answer\n        if answer_started\n            current_answer *= rstrip(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # If both question and answer have been started and completed, save the pair\n        if !question_started && !answer_started && !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n            push!(qa_pairs, (strip(current_question), strip(current_answer)))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of question-answer pairs\n    return qa_pairs\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nqa_pairs = q_and_a_extractor_multiple(md_text)\nfor (q, a) in qa_pairs\n    println(\"Question: \", q)\n    println(\"Answer: \", a)\nend\n```\n\nThis modified function `q_and_a_extractor_multiple` will return a list of tuples, each containing a question and its corresponding answer.","status":200,"tokens":[100,1129],"elapsed":87.398104417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":824647660,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
