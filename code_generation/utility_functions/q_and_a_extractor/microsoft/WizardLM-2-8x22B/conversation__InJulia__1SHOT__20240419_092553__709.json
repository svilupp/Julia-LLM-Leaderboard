Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and extracts the text under the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer text with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    question_started = false\n    answer_started = false\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines to extract question and answer\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a heading and start capturing accordingly\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            question_started = true\n            answer_started = false\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            question_started = false\n            answer_started = true\n        elseif question_started\n            # Append the line to the question, stripping leading/trailing whitespace\n            question *= rstrip(lstrip(line)) * \"\\n\"\n        elseif answer_started\n            # Append the line to the answer, stripping leading/trailing whitespace\n            answer *= rstrip(lstrip(line)) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove the heading lines from the question and answer\n    question = strip(question[15:end])  # Assuming the format \"# Question\\n\\nText\"\n    answer = strip(answer[11:end])    # Assuming the format \"# Answer\\n\\nText\"\n    \n    # Return the tuple with the extracted question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Some Title\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another Question\nWho wrote '1984'?\n\n# Another Answer\n'1984' was written by George Orwell.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown text follows a consistent format where the question and answer sections are clearly marked with `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, respectively, and that each question is followed by its corresponding answer.\n\nThe function also assumes that there is no other text between the heading and the actual question or answer text, except for optional newlines. If the markdown structure is more complex, the function would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function with a sample markdown text and print the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[100,681],"elapsed":34.199883958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":233185672,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
