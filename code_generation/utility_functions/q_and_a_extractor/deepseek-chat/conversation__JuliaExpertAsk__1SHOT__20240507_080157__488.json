The function assumes that the question and answer sections are separated by a newline and that each section starts with the specified markers (`# Question` and `# Answer`).\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Regular expression to match the question and answer sections\n    pattern = r'# (Question|Answer)\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?=\\n# |\\Z)'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer\n    question = matches[0][1].strip() if matches else ''\n    answer = matches[1][1].strip() if len(matches) > 1 else ''\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))  # Output: ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```\n\nThis function uses `re.findall` to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input text. The pattern is designed to match the section headers followed by the content until the next section header or the end of the text. The `[\\s\\S]*?` part is a non-greedy match that captures any character (including newlines) until the next part of the pattern is found. The `\\n# ` or `\\Z` at the end ensures that we stop capturing at the start of the next section or at the end of the text.\n\nThe function then extracts the question and answer from the matches, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and returns them in a tuple. If there are no matches or only one match, it returns an empty string for the missing part.","status":200,"tokens":[133,433],"elapsed":27.732663209,"cost":0.00013986,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1659317568,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
