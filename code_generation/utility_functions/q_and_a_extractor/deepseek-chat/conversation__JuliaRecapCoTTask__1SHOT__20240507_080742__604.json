[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will write a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that will iterate through the markdown-formatted text and identify the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. We will then extract the text following these markers, strip any leading spaces and newlines, and return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question = strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer = strip(line)\n            if answer !== nothing\n                return (question, answer)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachline` function to iterate over each line of the markdown text. It keeps track of whether it is currently inside a question or answer section using boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer`. When it finds a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the appropriate flag and continues to the next line. If it is inside a question or answer section, it strips the leading spaces and newlines from the line and assigns it to the `question` or `answer` variable. Once it has found an answer, it returns the tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is at most one question and one answer in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions and answers, the function will return the last question and the first answer it encounters. If you need to handle multiple questions and answers, you would need to modify the function to store all questions and answers and return them in a more appropriate data structure, such as a list or a dictionary.","status":200,"tokens":[382,471],"elapsed":29.126205417,"cost":0.00018536000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1823223191,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
