It extracts the relevant text and stores it in the `question` and `answer` variables, respectively. Once both have been found, it returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[232,425],"elapsed":26.254819875,"cost":0.00015148,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1877447645,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
