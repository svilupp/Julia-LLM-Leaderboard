Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

When it encounters a line starting with \"## Question\", it starts collecting lines that follow until it encounters a line starting with \"## Answer\". Similarly, it collects lines following \"## Answer\" until it encounters another \"## Question\" or the end of the string. It then joins the collected lines into the question and answer strings, respectively, and returns them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[94,347],"elapsed":21.013609583,"cost":0.00011032000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1676250347,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
