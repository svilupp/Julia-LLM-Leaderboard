The function `q_and_a_extractor` uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then extracts the text following these markers until the next newline character.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question_pattern = re.compile(r'# Question\\n(.*?)\\n', re.DOTALL)\n    answer_pattern = re.compile(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n', re.DOTALL)\n    \n    question_match = question_pattern.search(md)\n    answer_match = answer_pattern.search(md)\n    \n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else None\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else None\n    \n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))  # Output: ('What is the capital of France?', 'Paris')\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple with the question and answer, or `(None, None)` if no matching sections are found. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` to match any character including a newline, which is necessary to capture the entire text of the question and answer sections. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[133,374],"elapsed":24.185739833,"cost":0.00012334000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1806448063,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
