This function assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted and that the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections are properly delineated with the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_start = occursin(r\"^# Question\", md, overlap=false)\n    answer_start = occursin(r\"^# Answer\", md, overlap=false)\n\n    if !question_start || !answer_start\n        error(\"Markdown text does not contain both 'Question' and 'Answer' sections\")\n    end\n\n    question_end = findfirst(r\"^# Answer\", md, question_start.start + 1)\n    answer_end = findnext(r\"^#\", md, answer_start.start + 1)\n\n    if answer_end === nothing\n        answer_end = length(md) + 1\n    end\n\n    question = strip(md[question_start.start + 10:question_end.start - 1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start.start + 8:answer_end.start - 1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections using regular expressions. It then finds the end of the \"Question\" section by looking for the start of the \"Answer\" section, and the end of the \"Answer\" section by looking for the next section header. It strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns the question and answer in a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted and that the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections are properly delineated with the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers. If the markdown text is not well-formatted, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[94,457],"elapsed":32.31989425,"cost":0.00014112,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-322941751,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
