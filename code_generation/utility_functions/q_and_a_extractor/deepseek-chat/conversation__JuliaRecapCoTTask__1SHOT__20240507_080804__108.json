[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = startswith(md, \"# Question\")\n    answer_start = startswith(md, \"# Answer\")\n\n    if !question_start || !answer_start\n        error(\"The markdown text does not contain both Question and Answer sections\")\n    end\n\n    question_end = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    answer_end = findlast(\"# Question\", md)\n\n    if question_end === nothing || answer_end === nothing\n        error(\"The markdown text does not contain both Question and Answer sections\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(md[question_start[end] + 1:question_end[1] - 1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start[end] + 1:answer_end[end] - 1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the markdown text contains both Question and Answer sections. If not, it throws an error. Then it finds the start and end of the Question and Answer sections, strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, and returns the answer in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are not nested within each other, and that there are no other sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer` in the markdown text. If these assumptions do not hold, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[382,357],"elapsed":21.009402375,"cost":0.00015344000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-389200404,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
