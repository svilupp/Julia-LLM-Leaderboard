It keeps track of whether it's currently inside a \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section. When it finds a line that starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`. Similarly, when it finds a line that starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n\nIt then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns the question and answer as a tuple. If no answer is found, it returns the question and an empty string as the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[94,347],"elapsed":21.622556417,"cost":0.00011032000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1367659452,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
