[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will need to parse the markdown-formatted text and identify the sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Once we find these sections, we will extract the text following them, strip any leading spaces and newlines, and return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere is the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_pattern = r\"^# Question\\s*(.*)$\"m\n    answer_pattern = r\"^# Answer\\s*(.*)$\"m\n    \n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if occursin(question_pattern, line)\n            question = strip(match(question_pattern, line).captures[1])\n        elseif occursin(answer_pattern, line)\n            answer = strip(match(answer_pattern, line).captures[1])\n        end\n        \n        # If we have both a question and an answer, return the tuple\n        if !isnothing(question) && !isnothing(answer)\n            return (question, answer)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no question or answer is found, return nothing\n    return nothing\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match the start of the Question and Answer sections. It iterates over each line in the markdown text, checks if the line matches either the question or answer pattern, and if so, captures the text following the pattern. It then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the captured text.\n\nThe function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` if both a question and an answer are found. If no question or answer is found, it returns `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are separated by newlines and that there are no nested Question and Answer sections. If the markdown text has a different structure, the regular expressions and the logic of the function may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[382,458],"elapsed":28.788178791,"cost":0.00018172000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":820131005,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
