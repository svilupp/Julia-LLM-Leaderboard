This function uses regular expressions to find the sections and then strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Question and Answer sections\n    pattern = r\"^# (Question|Answer)\\n((?:(?!\\n# ).)*)\\n\"s\n\n    # Find all matches in the markdown text\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md, overlap=true)\n\n    # Extract the question and answer from the matches\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for match in matches\n        if match.captures[1] == \"Question\"\n            question = match.captures[2]\n        elseif match.captures[1] == \"Answer\"\n            answer = match.captures[2]\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    # Return the question and answer in a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your markdown-formatted text to it:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are well-formatted with a single line of `# Question` or `# Answer` followed by the text, and that there are no other sections starting with `# `. If the markdown text has different formatting, the regular expression and the function may need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[94,431],"elapsed":26.814059834,"cost":0.00013384,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1538614963,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
