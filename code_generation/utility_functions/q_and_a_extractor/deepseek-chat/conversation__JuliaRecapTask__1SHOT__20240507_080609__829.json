[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia that uses regular expressions to find the question and answer sections in the markdown text. The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a string `md` as input and returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_pattern = r\"^# Question\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^# Answer\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#|$)\"m\n    match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    if match !== nothing\n        question = strip(match.captures[1][1])\n        answer = strip(match.captures[2][1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `match` function from the `Base.Regex` module to find the question and answer sections. The regular expression `^# Question\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^# Answer\\n([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#|$)` matches the question and answer sections. The `^# Question\\n` and `^# Answer\\n` parts of the regular expression match the start of the question and answer sections. The `([\\s\\S]*?)` parts of the regular expression match the text in the question and answer sections. The `(?=#|$)` part of the regular expression is a positive lookahead that ensures that the match is followed by a `#` or the end of the string.\n\nThe `match.captures[1][1]` and `match.captures[2][1]` parts of the function extract the text from the question and answer sections. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThe function returns a tuple of the question and answer. If no match is found, the function returns an empty string for both the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[381,430],"elapsed":28.254855916,"cost":0.00017374000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":468383914,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
