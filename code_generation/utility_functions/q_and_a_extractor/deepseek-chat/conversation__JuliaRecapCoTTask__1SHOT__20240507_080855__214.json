[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will write a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that will iterate through the markdown-formatted text `md` and look for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. We will then extract the text following these markers and strip any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question = strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer = strip(line)\n            return (question, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachline` function to iterate over each line of the input string `md`. It checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` to determine if it should start collecting the question or answer text. Once it finds an `# Answer` line, it returns the collected question and answer as a tuple. If there is no `# Answer` line, it will return the last collected question and answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one question and one answer pair in the markdown text. If there are multiple question and answer pairs, this function will only return the last one it encounters. If you need to handle multiple pairs, you would need to modify the function to keep track of all pairs and return them in a list or another appropriate data structure.","status":200,"tokens":[382,406],"elapsed":23.682544875,"cost":0.00016716000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-31578891,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
