[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` to determine if it's in a question or answer section. If it's in a question section, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the line and assigns it to the `question` variable. If it's in an answer section, it does the same for the `answer` variable. If an answer is found, it returns the tuple `(question, answer)`. If no answer is found, it returns the tuple with the current `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[381,326],"elapsed":21.293610417,"cost":0.00014462,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1136580508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
