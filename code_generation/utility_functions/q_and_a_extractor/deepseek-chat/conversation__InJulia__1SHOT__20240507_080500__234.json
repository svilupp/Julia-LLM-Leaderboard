If the markdown text has multiple sets of questions and answers, the function will extract all of them and pair them accordingly. If the lengths of questions and answers are not equal, the function will only pair up to the minimum length.","status":200,"tokens":[94,478],"elapsed":29.47413075,"cost":0.000147,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-873713565,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
