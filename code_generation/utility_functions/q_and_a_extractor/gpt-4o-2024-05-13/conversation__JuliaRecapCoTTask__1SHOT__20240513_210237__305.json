[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the given task, we need to create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts text from the markdown sections titled \"Question\" and \"Answer\". Here are the steps we'll take:\n\n1. **Identify Sections**: We'll locate the starting points of sections marked by `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Extract Text**: We will extract the text between these markers.\n3. **Clean Text**: Strip any leading/trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. **Return Result**: Return the cleaned text from \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in a tuple.\n\nLet's write the function in Julia. First, recall the key Julia snippets that might be useful:\n- String manipulation functions like `strip`, `occursin`, `findfirst`, `chop`.\n- Indexing and slicing for extracting specific parts of the string.\n- Tuple creation for returning results.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    question_marker = \"# Question\"\n    answer_marker = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    # Find start indices of the markers\n    q_start = findfirst(question_marker, md)\n    a_start = findfirst(answer_marker, md)\n    \n    if q_start === nothing || a_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections must be present in the input\")\n    end\n    \n    # Define where each section starts and ends\n    q_start += length(question_marker)\n    a_start += length(answer_marker)\n    \n    q_end = findfirst(\"# \", md, q_start)\n    a_end = findfirst(\"# \", md, a_start)\n    \n    # Extract the sections\n    question_text = q_end === nothing ? md[q_start:end] : md[q_start:q_end-1]\n    answer_text = a_end === nothing ? md[a_start:end] : md[a_start:a_end-1]\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace\n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Markers Identification**: We identify the start of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n    ```julia\n    q_start = findfirst(question_marker, md)\n    a_start = findfirst(answer_marker, md)\n    ```\n    We handle the case where either marker is missing by throwing an error.\n    \n- **Determine Section Boundaries**: We set the start index just after the markers and find the next section header to determine the end.\n    ```julia\n    q_start += length(question_marker)\n    a_start += length(answer_marker)\n    ```\n    \n    Use `findfirst` to search for the beginning of the next markdown header (`\"# \"`), treating start-to-end cases using conditions.\n    \n- **Extract and Clean Text**: Extracting text slices from the markdown and then using `strip` to remove any extra spaces or newlines.\n    ```julia\n    question_text = strip(md[q_start:q_end])\n    answer_text = strip(md[a_start:a_end])\n    ```\n\n- **Return in a Tuple**: Finally, return the cleaned versions of the question and answer text in a tuple.\n    ```julia\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\n    ```\n\nWith this function, you can extract questions and answers from markdown-formatted text reliably while ensuring all leading/trailing whitespaces are removed.","status":200,"tokens":[349,717],"elapsed":8.233176667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1729753572,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
