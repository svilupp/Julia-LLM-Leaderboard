X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Identify the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text.\n2. Extract the text between these positions.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return a tuple of (Question, Answer).\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown does not contain both Question and Answer sections\")\n    end\n    \n    question_start += length(\"# Question\")\n    answer_start += length(\"# Answer\")\n    \n    question_text = strip(md[question_start:answer_start-1])\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start:end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's run some tests to verify the function:\n\n```julia\n# Test markdown\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introduction section.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nWe'll also test edge cases like extra spaces and newlines.\n\n```julia\n# Test markdown with extra spaces and newlines\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introduction section.\n\n\n# Question\n   \n   What is the capital of France?\n\n         \n# Answer\n    \n    The capital of France is Paris.\n       \n\"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThese tests should confirm that our function correctly extracts and strips the necessary text.\n\nHere's the complete function again for clarity:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown does not contain both Question and Answer sections\")\n    end\n    \n    question_start += length(\"# Question\")\n    answer_start += length(\"# Answer\")\n    \n    question_text = strip(md[question_start:answer_start-1])\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start:end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function should handle the task as described.","status":200,"tokens":[348,633],"elapsed":5.852656834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":579357714,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
