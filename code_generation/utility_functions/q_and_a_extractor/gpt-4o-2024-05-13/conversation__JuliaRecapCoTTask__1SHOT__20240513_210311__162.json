[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the steps needed to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identify Markdown Sections**: We need to locate text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Extract Text**: Extract the text between these markdown headings.\n3. **Clean Text**: Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. **Return Tuple**: Return the cleaned text as a tuple.\n\n### Useful Julia Code Snippets\n- **Regular Expressions**: `r\"# Question(.*) # Answer\"` to capture sections.\n- **String Operations**: `strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace.\n  \n### Plan\n1. Use regular expressions to locate the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n2. Capture and clean the content between these sections.\n3. Construct and return the result as a tuple.\n\n### Implementation\nHere's the Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` based on the above plan:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Define regular expression to match # Question and # Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s+(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s+(.*)\"\n    \n    # Find question section\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Find answer section\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check\n- Ensure that the function handles cases where there might not be a `# Answer` after `# Question`.\n- Confirm that all leading/trailing spaces and newlines are stripped correctly.\n\n### Example Usage\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n  What is the capital of France?\n  \n# Answer\n  The capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Should return: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nWith the `q_and_a_extractor` function implemented, it should handle the task as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[349,461],"elapsed":4.221389917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1209496901,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
