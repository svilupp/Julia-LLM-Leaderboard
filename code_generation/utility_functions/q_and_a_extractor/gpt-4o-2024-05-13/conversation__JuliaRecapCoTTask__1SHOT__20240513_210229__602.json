[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Specifically, we will use `occursin`, `findfirst`, `findnext`, and slicing techniques to isolate the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - Identify the starting points of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - Extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - Extract the text after `# Answer`.\n   - Strip leading spaces and newlines from both extracted texts.\n   - Return the results as a tuple.\n\n3. **Double-check** that the solution is correct and handles edge cases (e.g., when one of the sections is missing).\n\nHere is the Julia code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Identify start of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections must be present.\")\n    end\n\n    # To find the actual content, we need to get the locations just after the headers\n    question_content_start = question_start + length(\"# Question\")\n    answer_content_start = answer_start + length(\"# Answer\")\n\n    # Extract the content between the sections\n    question_raw = strip(md[question_content_start:answer_start - 1])\n    answer_raw = strip(md[answer_content_start:end])\n\n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question_raw, answer_raw)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We identified the starting positions of `# Question` and `# Answer` using `findfirst`.\n- The actual content positions are adjusted by adding the length of the section headers.\n- `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace and newlines.\n- The result is returned as a tuple containing the stripped contents of the Question and Answer sections.\n\n### Let's add a test case to ensure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n# Expected Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis should correctly implement the task.","status":200,"tokens":[349,509],"elapsed":4.922618333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1140206486,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
