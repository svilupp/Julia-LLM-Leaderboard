Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's walk through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Sections:** We need to locate the sections marked by `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Extract Content:** Once the sections are identified, we'll extract the text within these sections.\n3. **Strip Leading Spaces/Newlines:** Clean up the extracted text to remove leading spaces and newlines.\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Finally, return the question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Use regular expressions to capture the text between the headers\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s+([^#]+)\", md)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s+([^#]+)\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the matched content and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regular expressions:** We use regex to match the text between `# Question` and the next `#` or end of the string. Similarly, for `# Answer`.\n- **Capture groups:** The text between headers is captured using parentheses `([^#]+)`.\n- **Conditional check:** If the match is found, we strip leading/trailing whitespace; otherwise, default to an empty string.\n- **Return Tuple:** We return the cleaned text as a tuple.\n\nThis function should work effectively for the provided example and similar markdown-formatted text inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[210,409],"elapsed":3.790480875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-893023640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
