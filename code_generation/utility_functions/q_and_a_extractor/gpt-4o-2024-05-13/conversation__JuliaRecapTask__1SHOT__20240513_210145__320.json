[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Identify the start of the `# Question` section.\n2. Identify the start of the `# Answer` section.\n3. Extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n4. Extract the text after `# Answer`.\n5. Return the tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere's how we can write the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the positions of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Check if both tags exist\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown text does not contain both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text between the found positions\n    question_text = strip(md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start - 1])\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n\nThis function identifies the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer`, extracts the text between and after them respectively, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and returns the tuple.\n\nLet's create some test cases to verify the function works correctly:\n\n```julia\nmd1 = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is introductory text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\nThe answer is 4.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\nRandom text.\n\n# Question\nDefine photosynthesis.\n\n# Answer\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments.\n\"\"\"\n\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md1) == (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md2) == (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"The answer is 4.\")\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md3) == (\"Define photosynthesis.\", \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments.\")\n```\n\nRunning these tests will ensure that our solution is robust and covers various standard scenarios.\n\n### Full Code\n\nHere is the complete solution with test cases:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the positions of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Check if both tags exist\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown text does not contain both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text between the found positions\n    question_text = strip(md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start - 1])\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n\n# Test cases\nmd1 = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is introductory text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Answer\nThe answer is 4.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\nRandom text.\n\n# Question\nDefine photosynthesis.\n\n# Answer\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments.\n\"\"\"\n\nusing Test\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md1) == (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md2) == (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"The answer is 4.\")\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md3) == (\"Define photosynthesis.\", \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments.\")\n```\n\nThis ensures our implementation is both correct and thorough, covering extraction of text as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[348,991],"elapsed":12.68105425,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1886759189,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
