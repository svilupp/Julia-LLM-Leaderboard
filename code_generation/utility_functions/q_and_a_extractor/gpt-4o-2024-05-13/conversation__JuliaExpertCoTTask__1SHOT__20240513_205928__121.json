Identify and extract the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n2. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n3. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's write the function `q_and_a_extractor` to accomplish this.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Define patterns to identify start of Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*# Answer\\s*\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*)\"\n\n    # Use regex to extract the question part\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? question_match.captures[1] : \"\"\n\n    # Use regex to extract the answer part\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? answer_match.captures[1] : \"\"\n\n    # Strip leading/trailing spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    # Return the result as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's verify the function using the given data.\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define two regex patterns to capture the question and answer sections.\n- Extract the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections for the question.\n- Extract the text following the `# Answer` section for the answer.\n- Strip any leading/trailing spaces and newlines from both the question and the answer.\n- Return the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` should correctly handle the given markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[210,431],"elapsed":4.222417542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1279718051,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
