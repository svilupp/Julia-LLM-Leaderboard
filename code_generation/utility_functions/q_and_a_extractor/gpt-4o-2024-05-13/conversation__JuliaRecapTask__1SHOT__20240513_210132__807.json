[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task of extracting the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from a markdown-formatted text, we can use Julia's string manipulation capabilities. We need to search the text for the headers `# Question` and `# Answer` and then extract the text that follows these headers. \n\nHere are the steps we will follow:\n1. Locate the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.\n2. Extract the text under each header until the beginning of the next header or the end of the text.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted \"Question\" and \"Answer\" as a tuple.\n\nLet's write the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_header = \"# Question\"\n    answer_header = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    # Find the indices of the headers\n    question_start = findfirst(occursin(question_header), split(md, '\\n'))\n    answer_start = findfirst(occursin(answer_header), split(md, '\\n'))\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections must be present in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer texts by slicing the input accordingly\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question_lines = lines[question_start+1 : answer_start-1]\n    answer_lines = lines[answer_start+1 : end]\n    \n    # Combine lines and strip leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question_text = join(question_lines, \"\\n\")\n    answer_text = join(answer_lines, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We split the markdown text by newline characters using `split(md, '\\n')` to work with lines.\n2. We locate the line numbers of the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers using `findfirst(occursin(header), split(md, '\\n'))`.\n3. We ensure both headers are present.\n4. We extract the lines corresponding to the question and answer sections.\n5. We join the lines back into single strings for each section and strip any leading or trailing white spaces and newlines using `strip`.\n6. Finally, we return the question and answer texts as a tuple.\n\nLetâ€™s test our function with an example markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```julia\n(\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\")\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that all required text is extracted and properly formatted as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[348,607],"elapsed":5.471577167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1880197815,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
