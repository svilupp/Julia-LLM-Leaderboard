Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's break down the steps to solve the task. \n\n## Steps:\n1. Identify the sections for `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract text under each section.\n3. Return these texts as a tuple after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\n## Function Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question_start = occursin(\"# Question\", md) ? findfirst(\"# Question\", md)[end] + 1 : nothing\n    question_end = occursin(\"# Answer\", md) ? findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)[begin] - 1 : nothing\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || question_end === nothing\n        error(\"Both # Question and # Answer sections must be present in the given markdown.\")\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(md[question_start:question_end])\n\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)[end] + 1\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start:end])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function with provided data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We search for `# Question` to identify where the Question section starts.\n2. We search for `# Answer` to identify where the Question section ends and Answer section starts.\n3. Extract the text in between those markers for the question.\n4. Similarly, extract the text for the answer.\n5. Strip any leading/trailing spaces and newlines from both texts.\n6. Return them as a tuple.\n\n### Example Run:\nGiven the text:\n```markdown\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n```\nThe output would be:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[210,403],"elapsed":4.481347709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2110603346,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
