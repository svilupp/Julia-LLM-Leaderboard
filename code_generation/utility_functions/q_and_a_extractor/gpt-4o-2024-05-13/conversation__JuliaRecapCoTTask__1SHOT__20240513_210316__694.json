[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting the Question and Answer from the markdown text, we can assume that the sections are clearly defined by the headers `# Question` and `# Answer`. We will:\n\n1. Locate the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text in between these headers.\n3. Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines.\n\nLet's write the `q_and_a_extractor` function step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Required Headers\n\nWe will search for the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown text.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Text\n\nExtract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` for the question, and between `# Answer` and the next section (or end of text) for the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Strip Leading/Trailing Whitespace\n\nEnsure that the extracted texts are cleaned of any leading or trailing spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's the complete Julia code for the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Locate positions of the headers\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if (question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing)\n        error(\"The markdown text lacks a proper structure with # Question and/or # Answer headers\")\n    end\n    \n    # Adjust indices to get the start after the headers\n    question_start += length(\"# Question\")\n    answer_start += length(\"# Answer\")\n    \n    # Find end of the question section\n    answer_header_position = question_start <= answer_start ? answer_start - length(\"# Answer\") : length(md)\n    \n    # Extract and strip text\n    question = strip(md[question_start:answer_header_position-1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start:end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nBelow is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nHere is the introduction.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q_and_a[1])\nprintln(\"Answer: \", q_and_a[2])\n```\n\nThis function and example will properly extract and print the question and answer from the provided markdown text.
