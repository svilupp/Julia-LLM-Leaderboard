[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The `# Question` and `# Answer` denote the start of their respective sections, and we need to extract all text between these headings, stripping leading spaces and newlines. \n\nBelow are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Identify the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the corresponding text sections.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted sections.\n4. Return the results as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Finding the positions of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Checking if both headings are found\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both # Question and # Answer headings must be present in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the text between these positions\n    question_text = md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start - 1]\n    answer_text = md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end]\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines\n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\n\nLet's get started with our markdown text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\nThis concludes our document.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nHereâ€™s a summary of what this code does:\n- It finds the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Extracts text content between `# Question` and `# Answer` headings.\n- Strips leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted content.\n- Returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with these cleaned sections.\n\nLet's double-check the solution with the given example to ensure everything works correctly:\n```julia\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\n\nLet's get started with our markdown text.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\nThis concludes our document.\n\"\"\"\n\n(q, a) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nAfter running this snippet, it should output the respective `question` and `answer` correctly.
