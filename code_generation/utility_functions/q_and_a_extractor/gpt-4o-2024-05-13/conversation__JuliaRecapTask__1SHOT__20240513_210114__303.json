[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting text from specific sections in a markdown-formatted text, we can use Julia's powerful string processing capabilities. We'll focus on these key steps:\n\n1. Identify the start and end indices of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers.\n2. Extract the text between those indices.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's how we can systematically approach this:\n\n### Useful Julia Functions and Snippets\n- **Regular Expressions:** To find the positions of the headers.\n- **String Manipulations:** Using `strip` to remove leading/trailing spaces and `findfirst` to locate the headers.\n- **Substrings:** To extract text between identified indices.\n\n### Solution\n\nBelow is the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find positions for the start of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_start = findfirst(r\"(?i)#\\s*Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(r\"(?i)#\\s*Answer\", md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown text must contain both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract text after the headers\n    question_text = md[question_start.end+1:answer_start-1]\n    answer_text = md[answer_start.end+1:end]\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Headers Detection:**  \n   We use `findfirst` with a case-insensitive regular expression to locate the positions of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers.\n\n2. **Extract Text:**  \n   Using string slicing, we extract the text between the end of \"# Question\" and the start of \"# Answer\", and from the end of \"# Answer\" to the end of the document.\n\n3. **Strip Whitespace:**  \n   We use `strip` to clean up any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted sections.\n\n### Double-check\nWe'll verify a few scenarios:\n1. Normal case with both sections present.\n2. Edge case checks for missing # Question or # Answer which should raise an error.\n\n### Testing\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n\nmd = \"\"\"\n  # Question\n  What is the capital of Italy?\n\n  # Answer\n  The capital of Italy is Rome.\n  \"\"\"\n\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"What is the capital of Italy?\", \"The capital of Italy is Rome.\")\n\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nIs the Earth round?\n\n\n# Answer\nYes, the Earth is round.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n@test q_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"Is the Earth round?\", \"Yes, the Earth is round.\")\n\nprintln(\"All tests passed!\")\n```\n\nWith the presented code and tests, the function should handle the task properly.
