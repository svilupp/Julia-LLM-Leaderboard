X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Splits the text input into lines.\n2. Iterates through lines to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Collects texts under these sections until the next section or end of text.\n4. Strips any leading spaces and newlines from the collected texts.\n5. Returns a tuple with the cleaned question and answer.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")\n            current_section = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the solution\n\nCheck the following cases to ensure correctness:\n- Normal markdown with clear # Question and # Answer sections.\n- Multiple question and answer sections.\n- Cases where sections are empty or non-existent.\n- Ensure there is no leading or trailing whitespace in the output.\n\nLet's consider the following test case:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an example document.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\nThank you.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```julia\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Test it:\n\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThis should output the correct tuple.\n\n### Complete code including test:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"#\")\n            current_section = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n\n# Example usage for testing\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an example document.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\nThank you.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis should work as expected and provides the correct and clean extraction.","status":200,"tokens":[348,816],"elapsed":7.278080209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":120239511,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
