Below is the Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` which extracts the text from the markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and returns them as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question_start = findfirst(\"## Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"## Answer\", md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both `## Question` and `## Answer` sections must be present in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the question text\n    question_text = md[question_start + length(\"## Question\"):answer_start - 1]\n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n\n    # Extract the answer text\n    answer_text = md[answer_start + length(\"## Answer\"):end]\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Some other text\n## Question\nWhat is Julia?\n## Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\n|>\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function starts by finding the positions of the `## Question` and `## Answer` sections.\n- It then checks if these positions were found in the input markdown text. If not, it throws an error.\n- The function proceeds to extract the text between these sections and strips leading and trailing spaces and newlines.\n- Finally, it returns the stripped question and answer texts as a tuple.\n\nThis function assumes that the `## Question` and `## Answer` headers are present in the markdown text and there is no nested or duplicate headers. Adjustments might be necessary if the markdown structure differs significantly.","status":200,"tokens":[92,401],"elapsed":3.679773292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2074332912,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
