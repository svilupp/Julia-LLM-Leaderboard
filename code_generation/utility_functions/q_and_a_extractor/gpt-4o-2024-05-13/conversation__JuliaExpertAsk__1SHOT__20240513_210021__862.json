Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Hereâ€™s a concise implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String,String}\n    question_start = r\"# Question\\n\"\n    answer_start = r\"# Answer\\n\"\n    \n    q_start = findfirst(question_start, md)\n    a_start = findfirst(answer_start, md)\n    \n    question = q_start ? strip(md[q_start+length(question_start):a_start-1]) : \"\"\n    answer = a_start ? strip(md[a_start+length(answer_start):end]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. Use regular expressions `question_start` and `answer_start` to identify the start of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections.\n2. Find the positions of these sections in the text.\n3. Extract and strip the text between the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, and from the \"Answer\" section to the end of the text.\n4. Return a tuple with the cleaned question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[125,219],"elapsed":2.609697625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-139327152,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
