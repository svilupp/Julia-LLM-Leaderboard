[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will create a function called `q_and_a_extractor` that processes markdown text and extracts the contents of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, returning them as a tuple.\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections using the markdown headers (`# Question` and `# Answer`).\n2. Extract the content between these headers.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines from the extracted content.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if isnothing(question_start) || isnothing(answer_start)\n        error(\"Markdown text must contain '# Question' and '# Answer' sections\")\n    end\n    \n    question_start += length(\"# Question\")\n    answer_start += length(\"# Answer\")\n    \n    question_text = strip(md[question_start:answer_start - length(\"# Answer\")])\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start:end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the steps for clarity:\n\n1. `findfirst(\"# Question\", md)` locates the starting position of the \"Question\" section.\n2. `findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)` locates the starting position of the \"Answer\" section.\n3. We ensure both sections exist; otherwise, the function throws an error.\n4. Adjust the indices to get the actual content:\n   - Add the length of the header to the starting index (`question_start` becomes the index after `# Question`).\n   - Fetch everything between the end of the `# Question` header and the start of the `# Answer` header.\n   - Strip this content to remove leading and trailing spaces/newlines.\n5. Finally, fetch everything after the `# Answer` header and strip it similarly.\n6. Return the two cleaned strings as a tuple.\n\nThis structure should make the extraction clear, robust, and aligned with common Markdown formatting conventions.","status":200,"tokens":[349,439],"elapsed":5.183486125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1667776272,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
