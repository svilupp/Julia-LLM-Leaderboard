Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that extracts text from sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer` in a markdown-formatted string.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*\\n+(.+?)\\n+#\\s*Answer\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*\\n+(.+?)$\"\n\n    question = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    question_text = question !== nothing ? strip(question.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer !== nothing ? strip(answer.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses regular expressions to find the sections of text that follow `# Question` and `# Answer`. The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. It defines a pattern for the `# Question` section that captures the text until it meets the `# Answer` section. \n2. It defines a pattern for the `# Answer` section that captures the text till the end of the string.\n3. It extracts the text using the `match` function from each section.\n4. It strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n5. It returns a tuple with the extracted `question` and `answer` text.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,391],"elapsed":4.63964275,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1452528445,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
