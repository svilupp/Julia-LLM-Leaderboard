Identify the sections for \"Question\" and \"Answer\" in the provided markdown text.\n2. Extract the text following each section header.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the result as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nWe can use Julia's string manipulation functions to achieve this.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input string by newlines first\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Flags to identify when we are within question or answer sections\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    # Iterate over lines to extract the relevant sections\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip any leading/trailing spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided example\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n1. We split the input string by new lines to process each line individually.\n2. We use flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether we are within the 'Question' or 'Answer' sections.\n3. If we encounter the \"# Question\" header, we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`. Similarly, encountering the \"# Answer\" header toggles the flags appropriately.\n4. We concatenate lines to the respective variables (`question` and `answer`) while in the corresponding sections.\n5. After collecting the lines, we strip any leading or trailing whitespace/newlines.\n6. The function returns the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[210,520],"elapsed":4.805691708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1404471781,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
