Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n  question_start = findfirst(r\"# Question\\n\", md)\n  answer_start = findfirst(r\"# Answer\\n\", md)\n\n  if !isnothing(question_start) && !isnothing(answer_start)\n    question = trim(md[question_start+13:answer_start-1])\n    answer = trim(md[answer_start+9:end])\n    return (question, answer)\n  else\n    return (nothing, nothing)\n  end\nend\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n **Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Text Sections:** The function searches the input `md` string for the markers \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" using regular expressions.\n\n2.  **Extract and Trim:** If both markers are found, it extracts the text between them, removing any leading/trailing spaces and newlines using the `trim` function.\n\n3.  **Return Result:** It returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. If the markers are not found, it returns `(nothing, nothing)` indicating no Q&A was detected.","status":200,"tokens":[225,285],"elapsed":2.142046208,"cost":0.00010199999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-659942729,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
