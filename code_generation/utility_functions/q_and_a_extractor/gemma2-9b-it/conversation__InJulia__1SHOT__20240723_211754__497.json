This makes the output cleaner.\n- **Clearer variable names:** Variable names like `question` and `answer` are more descriptive.","status":200,"tokens":[98,663],"elapsed":1.595049292,"cost":0.00015219999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":833406439,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
