[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n  sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")\n  question = \"\"\n  answer = \"\"\n  \n  for i in 1:length(sections)\n    if startswith(sections[i], \"Question\")\n      question = trim(sections[i+1])\n    elseif startswith(sections[i], \"Answer\")\n      answer = trim(sections[i+1])\n      break \n    end\n  end\n  return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Splitting the input:**\n   - The `md` string is split into sections based on `\"\\n# \"`, effectively separating markdown headings.\n\n2. **Iterating through sections:**\n   - We loop through each section.\n\n3. **Identifying Question and Answer:**\n   - If a section starts with \"Question\", the subsequent section is assumed to be the question and is stored in the `question` variable after removing leading/trailing whitespace.\n   - If a section starts with \"Answer\", the subsequent section is the answer, stored in `answer`, and the loop breaks.\n\n4. **Returning the result:**\n    - The function returns a tuple containing the extracted `question` and `answer`.\n\n\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n\nThis solution assumes a consistent markdown format where questions and answers are always directly below their respective headings. It will require adjustments if the markdown structure varies.\n\n\n\n Let me know if you have any other markdown text extraction tasks!","status":200,"tokens":[369,332],"elapsed":1.402957792,"cost":0.0001402,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1012998057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
