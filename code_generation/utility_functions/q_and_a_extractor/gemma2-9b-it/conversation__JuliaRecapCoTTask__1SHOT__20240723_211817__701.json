[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

This gives us the index of this line.\n   - `answer_start`: Similarly, finds the index of the first line starting with \"# Answer\".\n\n3. **Handling Empty Questions/Answers:**\n\n   -  `if ( isBlank(...) )` checks if the lines before the question and answer markers are also empty strings. If so, it returns without extracting anything to avoid returning tuples with empty strings.\n\n\n4. **Extracting Text:**\n\n   - `start_question`:  Slices `md` from the line *after* `question_start` up to (but not including) the line of `answer_start`. This extracts the text between the markers.\n   - `start_answer`: Similarly, slices from the line *after* `answer_start` to the end.\n\n5. **Combining Lines:**\n\n   - `questions`:  Joins the extracted lines of the question section using newline characters (`\\n`).\n   - `answers`: Joins the extracted lines of the answer section.\n\n6. **Returning the Result:**\n\n   - The function returns a tuple containing `trim(questions)` and `trim(answers)`. The `trim` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[370,619],"elapsed":2.304447166,"cost":0.00019779999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-770656053,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
