[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n  question = \"\"\n  answer = \"\"\n  in_question = false\n  in_answer = false\n\n  for line in splitlines(md)\n    if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n      in_question = true\n      in_answer = false\n    elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n      in_question = false\n      in_answer = true\n    elseif in_question\n      question .= trim(line) . \"\\n\"\n    elseif in_answer\n      answer .= trim(line) . \"\\n\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  return (trim(question), trim(answer))\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** We first initialize empty strings for `question` and `answer`, and set two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n\n2. **Line-by-Line Processing:** \n   - The code iterates through each line of the input markdown text.\n   - If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`.\n   - If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n   - Inside the respective sections (while `in_question` or `in_answer` is true), the line is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `trim` and appended to the corresponding string.\n3. **Return:** After processing all lines, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the code!","status":200,"tokens":[370,390],"elapsed":2.134440208,"cost":0.000152,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1972837228,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
