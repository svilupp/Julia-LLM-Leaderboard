[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question, answer = nothing, nothing\n    \n    # Loop through lines in the markdown text\n    for line in split.(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = trim(line[findfirst(x -> x != \"#\" && x != \" \", line):end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = trim(line[findfirst(x -> x != \"#\" && x != \" \", line):end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - The code defines a function named `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a single argument `md`, representing the input markdown text as a string. \n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - Two variables, `question` and `answer`, are initialized to `nothing`. These will store the extracted question and answer text.\n\n3. **Line-by-Line Processing:**\n   - The code iterates through each line of the markdown text using `split.(md, \"\\n\")` which splits the string by newline characters.\n   - Inside the loop:\n     - It checks if the current line starts with `# Question` using `startswith`. If it does:\n       - It extracts the question text by finding the index of the first character that is not \"#\" or a space using `findfirst` and then slicing the line from that index to the end. \n       - The leading spaces and newlines are trimmed using `trim`.\n     - Similarly, if the line starts with `# Answer`, the answer text is extracted and trimmed.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted `question` and `answer`. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or questions!","status":200,"tokens":[370,417],"elapsed":3.34034075,"cost":0.00015739999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2063646466,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
