[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Use regular expressions to find the Q&A sections.\n    using Regex\n\n    question_match = match(Regex(\"(?<=# Question).*?(?=\\\\n# Answer)\", md), md, String)\n    answer_match = match(Regex(\"(?<=# Answer).*\", md), md, String)\n\n    return strip(question_match), strip(answer_match)\nend\n\n```\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Define the function:** We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown string `md` as input and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer as strings.\n\n2. **Use Regex for Extraction:**\n   - We utilize the `Regex` library to find sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" using regular expressions. \n   - The regular expression `(?<=# Question).*?(?=\\\\n# Answer)` is used to capture the entire text between \"# Question\" and the next line containing \"# Answer\". \n   - Similarly, `(?<=# Answer).*` captures everything after \"# Answer\".\n\n3. **Strip Leading Whitespace:**  We use the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question and answer text.\n\n4. **Return Extracted Data:** The function returns a tuple containing the extracted `question` and `answer`. \n\n\n\nThis approach leverages the power of regular expressions to precisely identify the desired text within the markdown input, while ensuring the extracted text is clean and ready for further processing.","status":200,"tokens":[370,348],"elapsed":2.767935917,"cost":0.0001436,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-756694684,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
