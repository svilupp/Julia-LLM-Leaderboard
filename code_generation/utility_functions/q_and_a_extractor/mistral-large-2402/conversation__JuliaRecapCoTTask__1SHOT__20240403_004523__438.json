[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in functions and following your problem-solving steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question:\\s*[\\n\\r](.+?)(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer:\\s*[\\n\\r](.+?)(?=#|\\z)\"\n\n    # Find the Question and Answer in the markdown text\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Check if both Question and Answer are present\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the Question and Answer\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n\n    # Return the Question and Answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. The `(?s)` at the start of the patterns is a flag that makes the `.` character match newline characters as well. The `[\\n\\r]` pattern matches a newline character (either a Unix-style `\\n` or a Windows-style `\\r\\n`). The `(.+?)` pattern matches and captures one or more characters in a non-greedy way. The `(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)` and `(?=#|\\z)` patterns are positive lookaheads that assert (without capturing) that the next characters are either the start of an Answer section, another section, or the end of the string.\n\nThe `match` function is used to find the first match of the pattern in the string. If no match is found, it returns `nothing`. The `captures` property of the `RegexMatch` object returned by `match` is a vector of the captured substrings. The first element (`captures[1]`) is the substring matched by the first (and in this case, only) capturing group in the pattern.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted strings.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted Question and Answer. If no Question or Answer is found, it returns a tuple of two empty strings.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Question section always appears before the Answer section, and that there is only one Question and one Answer in the markdown text. If these assumptions are not correct, the function may need to be modified.\n\nAs per your instructions, I haven't used any packages that aren't part of Julia's standard library. The function should be reasonably efficient, and the code should be clear and easy to understand. If you have any special instructions, please let me know, and I'll do my best to accommodate them.","status":200,"tokens":[404,751],"elapsed":17.548645791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":707772912,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
