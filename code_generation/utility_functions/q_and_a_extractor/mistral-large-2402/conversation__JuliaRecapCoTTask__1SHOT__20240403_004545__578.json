[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in functions and following the problem-solving steps you provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=#\\s*Question|\\z)\"s\n\n    # Find questions and answers\n    questions = matchall(question_pattern, md)\n    answers = matchall(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract and clean the text\n    extract_text(match) = strip(replace(match[1], r\"\\n\" => \" \"))\n    questions = extract_text.(questions)\n    answers = extract_text.(answers)\n\n    # Return a tuple of questions and answers\n    return [(q, a) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. It then extracts and cleans the text from these sections, removing any leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple of the cleaned question and answer text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that each Question section is followed by an Answer section, and it will stop extracting text at the next Question or Answer section or at the end of the string. If the structure of your markdown text is different, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle nested sections or other complex markdown structures. If your markdown text contains such structures, you may need a more sophisticated parsing approach.\n\nAs there were no special instructions provided, I followed the general guidelines for Julia programming.","status":200,"tokens":[404,454],"elapsed":11.265756083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1461102792,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
