This function uses regular expressions to find the text under the headers \"Question\" and \"Answer\".\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize question and answer as empty strings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the markdown nodes\n    for node in ast.content\n        if node isa Markdown.Header\n            # If the node is a header, check if it's \"Question\" or \"Answer\"\n            header_text = strip(node.content)\n            if header_text == \"Question\"\n                # If it's \"Question\", the next node should be the question text\n                question = strip(Markdown.content(next_sibling(node)))\n            elseif header_text == \"Answer\"\n                # If it's \"Answer\", the next node should be the answer text\n                answer = strip(Markdown.content(next_sibling(node)))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers are followed immediately by the question and answer text, respectively. If there might be other nodes in between, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[95,342],"elapsed":12.323187958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1613293933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
