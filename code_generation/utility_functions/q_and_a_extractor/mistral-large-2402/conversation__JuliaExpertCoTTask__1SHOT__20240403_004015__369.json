Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Initialize two empty strings for question and answer.\n   - Split the markdown text by newline characters to get each line.\n   - Iterate over the lines and check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n   - If it does, append the subsequent lines to the corresponding string until the next \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" is found.\n   - Return the tuple of question and answer strings after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    state = :none\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if state == :question\n            question *= \" \" * line\n        elseif state == :answer\n            answer *= \" \" * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function `q_and_a_extractor` is written to solve the task.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` correctly extracts the question and answer from the given markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[237,443],"elapsed":10.256922208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1809789868,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
