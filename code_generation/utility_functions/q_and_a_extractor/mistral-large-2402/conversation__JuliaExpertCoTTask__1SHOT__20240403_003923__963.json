Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple Julia function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    question_end = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    question = strip(md[question_start:question_end-1])\n\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    answer_end = findnext(\"#\", md, answer_start)\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start:answer_end-1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by finding the start and end indices of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in the markdown string, then using those indices to extract the relevant substrings. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted strings.\n\nYou can test this function with your provided data like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis should return a tuple `(\"Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\", \"Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[237,303],"elapsed":7.040655667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1782608126,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
