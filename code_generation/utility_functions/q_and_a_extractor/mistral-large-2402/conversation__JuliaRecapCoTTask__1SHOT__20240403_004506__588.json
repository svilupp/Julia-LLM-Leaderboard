[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in string functions and regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions for Question and Answer sections\n    q_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n    a_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n\n    # Find the first match for each section\n    q_match = match(q_regex, md)\n    a_match = match(a_regex, md)\n\n    # Check if both sections are present\n    if q_match !== nothing && a_match !== nothing\n        # Extract the matched text and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n        question = strip(q_match[1])\n        answer = strip(a_match[1])\n\n        # Return a tuple of question and answer\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        # If either section is missing, return nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining regular expressions to match the Question and Answer sections, then using Julia's `match` function to find the first match for each section in the provided markdown text. If both sections are present, it extracts the matched text, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and returns a tuple of the question and answer. If either section is missing, it returns `nothing`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are formatted correctly, with each section starting on a new line and separated by a hash (`#`) followed by the section name. It also assumes that the Answer section comes after the Question section.\n\nAs per your instructions, I've used Julia's standard library and general type annotations. The function should work with any markdown-formatted text represented as a string. If you have any specific performance concerns or other requirements, please let me know and I can adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[404,493],"elapsed":11.776258583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2028215524,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
