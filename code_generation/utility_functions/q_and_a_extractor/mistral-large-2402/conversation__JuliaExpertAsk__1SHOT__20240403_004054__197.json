If it finds a level-1 heading (`#`) that says \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it extracts the plain text from the next block and strips leading and trailing whitespace. The function returns a tuple of the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[136,264],"elapsed":5.934741334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-940685460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
