[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in functions and following the problem-solving steps you provided.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted, i.e., every question is followed by an answer, and there are no other headers in between.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize empty arrays to store questions and answers\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # If the line starts with \"# Question\", add the next lines until \"# Answer\" to questions\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(join(lines[i+1:min(i+1000, end)], \"\\n\")))\n            i += argmin(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), lines[i+1:end]) - 1\n        end\n        # If the line starts with \"# Answer\", add the next lines until the next \"# Question\" or end of text to answers\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(join(lines[i+1:min(i+1000, end)], \"\\n\")))\n            i += argmin(x -> startswith(x, \"# Question\") || startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), lines[i+1:end]) - 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return a tuple of questions and answers\n    return [(strip(q), strip(a)) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the lines of the markdown text and checking if each line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it adds the subsequent lines to the appropriate array until it reaches the next header. It then skips to the line after the next header and continues the process. Finally, it returns a tuple of each question and its corresponding answer, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.\n\nPlease replace `{{instructions}}` with any special instructions you have. If there are no special instructions, this function should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[404,563],"elapsed":14.141279042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-230352887,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
