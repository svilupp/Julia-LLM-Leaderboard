[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses Julia's built-in regex capabilities to find the sections of the markdown text that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", and then extracts the text that follows.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=#|\\z)\"s\n\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple where the first element is the question and the second element is the answer. If no question or answer is found, it will return an empty string for that part. Please note that this function assumes that the \"# Question\" section comes before the \"# Answer\" section. If that's not the case, you might need to adjust the regular expressions.","status":200,"tokens":[95,326],"elapsed":7.45509475,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1004907324,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
