Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Split the input string by newlines.\n   - Iterate through the lines to find the start of 'Question' and 'Answer' sections.\n   - Concatenate the subsequent lines until the next section starts or the end of the text.\n   - Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question and answer.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    question_start = findfirst(startswith(\"# Question\"), lines)\n    question_end = findfirst(startswith(\"# Answer\"), lines) - 1\n    question = join(strip.(lines[question_start:question_end]), \" \")\n\n    answer_start = findfirst(startswith(\"# Answer\"), lines)\n    answer_end = length(lines)\n    answer = join(strip.(lines[answer_start:answer_end]), \" \")\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n3.
