Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's a simple function using Julia's built-in regex and split functionality:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.+?)(?=#\\s*Answer)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.+?)(?=#|$)\"s\n\n    question = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question) || isnothing(answer)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        question = strip(question.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the text between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\", and \"# Answer\" and the next \"#\" (or the end of the string). The `s` at the end of the regex string is a modifier that makes the dot `.` match newlines as well. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text. If no question or answer is found, the function returns an empty tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[95,321],"elapsed":8.71464725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1641046442,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
