If it finds a header block with the text \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it takes the next block as the question or answer text, respectively, and converts it to plain text. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace. The function returns a tuple of the question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[136,267],"elapsed":6.132458417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-705146148,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
