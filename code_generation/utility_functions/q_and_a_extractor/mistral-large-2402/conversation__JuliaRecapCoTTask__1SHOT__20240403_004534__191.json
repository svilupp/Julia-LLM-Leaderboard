[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's a simple approach using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions and regular expressions. This function will work under the assumption that the question and answer are immediately followed by their respective headers (`# Question` and `# Answer`) and that each section continues until the next header or the end of the text.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions to match the question and answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"(?s)# Question\\n(.*?)(?=# Answer|\\z)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?s)# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=#|\\z)\"\n\n    # Extract the question and answer sections\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # Check if both sections were found\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        error(\"Both Question and Answer sections must be present in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the matched text and strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question_match.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n    answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines regular expressions to match the question and answer sections in the markdown text. It then uses these regular expressions to find the question and answer sections. If either section is not found, it throws an error. If both sections are found, it extracts the matched text, strips leading spaces and newlines, and returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[404,440],"elapsed":10.094848917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1400470558,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
