Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple Julia function that follows your instructions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    state = :none\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if state == :question\n            question *= \" \" * strip(line)\n        elseif state == :answer\n            answer *= \" \" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown string. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it updates its state and skips to the next line. If it's in the :question or :answer state, it appends the stripped line to the appropriate string. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped question and answer.\n\nYou can test the function with your provided data like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis should return `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[237,343],"elapsed":9.388115583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":961019030,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
