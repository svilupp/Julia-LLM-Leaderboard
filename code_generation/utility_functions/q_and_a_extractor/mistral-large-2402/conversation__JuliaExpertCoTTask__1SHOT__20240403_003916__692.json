Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n   - Use regular expressions or string manipulation functions to find and extract text between \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" for the question, and text after \"# Answer\" for the answer.\n   - Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n   - Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n(.+?)\\n# Answer\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n(.+)\"s\n\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    if question_match !== nothing && answer_match !== nothing\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.
