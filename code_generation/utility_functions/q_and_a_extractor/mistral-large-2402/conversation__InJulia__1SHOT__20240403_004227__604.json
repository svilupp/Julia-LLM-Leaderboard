Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then iterates over the blocks in the document. If it finds a header with the text \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it takes the next block and extracts the plain text from it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The function returns a tuple with the question and answer texts. If no \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section is found, it returns a tuple with `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[95,317],"elapsed":7.651761834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1433114412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
