[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple Julia function that uses regular expressions to extract the Question and Answer sections from a markdown formatted text.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n(.*)(?=# Answer)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n(.*)\"s\n\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining two regular expressions, one for the Question section and one for the Answer section. The `match` function is used to find the first occurrence of each section in the text. If either section is not found, the function returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text and returns it as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Answer section comes after the Question section and that there are no other sections in between. If your markdown text does not follow this format, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `Regex` module from Julia's standard library, so you don't need to install any additional packages to use it.\n\nRemember to test the function with different inputs to ensure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,524],"elapsed":14.652920041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1851171910,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
