[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in functions and following your guidelines:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer\n    q_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.+?)#\\s*Answer\"s\n    a_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.+?)(?=#|\\z)\"s\n\n    # Find Question and Answer in the markdown text\n    q_match = match(q_pattern, md)\n    a_match = match(a_pattern, md)\n\n    # If both Question and Answer are found\n    if !isnothing(q_match) && !isnothing(a_match)\n        # Extract the Question and Answer\n        question = strip(q_match[1])\n        answer = strip(a_match[1])\n\n        # Return the Question and Answer as a tuple\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        # If Question or Answer is not found, return an empty tuple\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. It then extracts the text in these sections, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the Question and Answer as a tuple. If either the Question or Answer section is not found in the text, the function returns an empty tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Answer section immediately follows the Question section, and that there are no other headers (starting with '#') until the next Question section. If your markdown text does not follow this format, you may need to adjust the regular expressions accordingly.\n\nAs per your instructions, I've used `AbstractString` as the type for the input `md`, which allows for any string-like object to be passed to the function. This function does not require any external packages, and it should be reasonably efficient for most use cases. However, if you need to process very large markdown files, you may need to consider a more efficient parsing strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[404,506],"elapsed":13.554690292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1093333871,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
