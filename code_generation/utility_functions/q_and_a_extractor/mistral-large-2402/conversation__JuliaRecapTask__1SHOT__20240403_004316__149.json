[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract the question and answer from a markdown formatted text. Here's a simple function that uses Julia's built-in regex and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.+?)#\\s*Answer\"s\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.+)\"s\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Check if both Question and Answer are present\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question_match[1], ['\\n', ' ', '\\r', '\\t'])\n    answer = strip(answer_match[1], ['\\n', ' ', '\\r', '\\t'])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining regex patterns for the Question and Answer sections, then using Julia's `match` function to find the first match of each pattern in the input string. If both sections are present, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns a tuple with the question and answer. If either section is not present, it returns a tuple of two empty strings.","status":200,"tokens":[402,363],"elapsed":8.575040666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1205679707,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
