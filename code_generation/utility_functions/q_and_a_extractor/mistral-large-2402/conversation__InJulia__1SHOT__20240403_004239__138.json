[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses Julia's built-in regular expressions to find the markdown sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\z)\"\n\n    question = strip(match(question_regex, md).captures[1])\n    answer = strip(match(answer_regex, md).captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining two regular expressions: one for the question and one for the answer. The `(?s)` at the start of each regular expression is a flag that makes the `.` character match newlines as well, which allows us to capture multi-line questions and answers. The `\\z` character matches the end of the string, and the `(?=...)` part is a positive lookahead that matches a position where the pattern inside the lookahead could start.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text. The `match` function is used to find the first match of the regular expression in the string, and the `captures` property is used to get the part of the string that was captured by the regular expression.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown text always starts with a question and ends with an answer, and that there's only one question and one answer in the text. If this isn't the case, the function might need to be modified to handle more complex markdown structures.","status":200,"tokens":[95,432],"elapsed":11.943024708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1786629465,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
