[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the `Markdown.jl` package to parse the markdown text, and then extracts the question and answer text.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    ast = Markdown.parse(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    for block in ast.content\n        if block isa Markdown.Header && block.content == \"Question\"\n            question = strip(Markdown.plaintext(next(ast.content, block)))\n        elseif block isa Markdown.Header && block.content == \"Answer\"\n            answer = strip(Markdown.plaintext(next(ast.content, block)))\n        end\n        if !(question === nothing || answer === nothing)\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the blocks in the markdown's abstract syntax tree (AST). If it finds a header block with the content \"Question\" or \"Answer\", it extracts the text from the next block and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The function returns a tuple of the question and answer text.\n\nPlease note that you need to install the `Markdown.jl` package before using this function. You can install it using the package manager in Julia by typing `] add Markdown` in the Julia REPL.\n\nAlso, this function assumes that the question and answer are in the next block after the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers, respectively. If your markdown text has a different structure, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[95,387],"elapsed":8.733890583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2060127440,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
