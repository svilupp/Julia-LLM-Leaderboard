Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write that function in Julia. Here's a simple way to do it using Julia's built-in regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Initialize question and answer as empty strings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the parsed markdown\n    for block in doc.content\n        if typeof(block) <: Markdown.Headers\n            header = strip(Markdown.content(block))\n            if header == \"Question\"\n                # The next block should be the question\n                question = strip(Markdown.content(next(block)))\n            elseif header == \"Answer\"\n                # The next block should be the answer\n                answer = strip(Markdown.content(next(block)))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown using `Markdown.parse`. It then iterates over the parsed markdown, looking for headers that are either \"Question\" or \"Answer\". When it finds such a header, it takes the content of the next block as the question or answer, respectively. It then returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[95,322],"elapsed":7.579349209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-485208744,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
