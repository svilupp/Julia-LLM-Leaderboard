[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple function that uses Julia's built-in string functions and regular expressions to accomplish this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=#|\\z)\"s\n\n    # Extract the Question and Answer sections\n    question = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # If both Question and Answer sections are found\n    if isnothing(question) == false && isnothing(answer) == false\n        # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n        question = strip(replace(question.captures[1], r\"^\\s+[\\n\\r]?\" => \"\"))\n        answer = strip(replace(answer.captures[1], r\"^\\s+[\\n\\r]?\" => \"\"))\n\n        # Return the Question and Answer as a tuple\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines regular expressions to match the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. It then uses these regular expressions to extract the Question and Answer sections. If both sections are found, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns the Question and Answer as a tuple. If either section is not found, it returns an empty string for that section.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the Question section always appears before the Answer section, and that there is only one Question and one Answer section in the markdown text. If these assumptions are not correct, the function may need to be modified.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `Regex` module for regular expression matching, which is part of Julia's standard library. Therefore, no additional packages need to be installed to use this function.\n\nAs per your instructions, I've prioritized performance and clarity, and I've used abstract type annotations to make the function as general as possible. The function should work with any markdown-formatted text that follows the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[404,548],"elapsed":14.738034916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-869665080,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
