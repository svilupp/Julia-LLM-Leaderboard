The `nextind` and `prevind` functions are used to skip the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" strings themselves. If any of the sections are not found, it returns an empty tuple. Finally, `strip` is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[136,260],"elapsed":6.064957916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-42050331,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
