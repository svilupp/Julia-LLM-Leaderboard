[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's a simple function that uses Julia's built-in string functions and regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions for Question and Answer sections\n    q_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n    a_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\Z)\"\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer\n    question = match(q_regex, md)\n    answer = match(a_regex, md)\n\n    # Check if both Question and Answer are present\n    if isnothing(question) || isnothing(answer)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n        question = strip(question.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n        answer = strip(answer.captures[1], ['\\n', ' '])\n\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines regular expressions to match the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. It then uses these regular expressions to extract the text following the Question and Answer headers. If either the Question or Answer is not present, it returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text and returns it as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[402,356],"elapsed":9.374187833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-262200218,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
