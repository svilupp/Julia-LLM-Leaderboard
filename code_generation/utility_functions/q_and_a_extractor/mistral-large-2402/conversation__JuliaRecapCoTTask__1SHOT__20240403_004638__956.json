[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer\n    q_pattern = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    a_pattern = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n\n    # Find questions and answers in the markdown text\n    q_match = match(q_pattern, md)\n    a_match = match(a_pattern, md)\n\n    # If both Question and Answer are found, return a tuple\n    if isnothing(q_match) || isnothing(a_match)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    else\n        question = strip(q_match.captures[1])\n        answer = strip(a_match.captures[1])\n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the first occurrences of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in the markdown text. The `(?s)` at the beginning of the patterns is a DOTALL modifier that makes the dot `.` match newline characters as well. The `(.*?)` part matches any character (including newlines, thanks to the DOTALL modifier), and the `(?=\\n#|$)` part is a positive lookahead that makes sure the match ends when a new section starts (`\\n#`) or at the end of the string (`$`). The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the \"Question\" section comes before the \"Answer\" section. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the function accordingly. Also, it only extracts the first occurrence of each section. If there are multiple \"Question\" or \"Answer\" sections in your markdown text, you may need to modify the function to handle that.\n\nAs per your instructions, I didn't use any external packages, and I used the `AbstractString` type for the input to make the function as general as possible. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.","status":200,"tokens":[404,562],"elapsed":13.667233791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":350932025,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
