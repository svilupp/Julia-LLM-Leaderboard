This function uses Julia's built-in regular expressions to match the desired sections of the markdown text.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\:.*?$(Regex(r\"(?=#\\s*Answer\\:)\"))\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\:.*\"\n\n    question = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question) || isnothing(answer)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question.match)\n    answer = strip(answer.match)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines two regular expressions: one for matching the \"Question\" section and one for matching the \"Answer\" section. The `(?s)` at the beginning of each regular expression is a flag that makes the `.` character match newline characters as well.\n\nThe `match` function is then used to find the first match of each regular expression in the given markdown text. If either match is not found, the function returns an empty tuple.\n\nFinally, the `strip` function is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the matched text, and the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,348],"elapsed":7.874321083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1087758550,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
