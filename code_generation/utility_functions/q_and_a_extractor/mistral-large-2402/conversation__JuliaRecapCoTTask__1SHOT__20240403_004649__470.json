[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text. Here's a simple function that uses Julia's built-in regex and split functions. This function assumes that the 'Question' and 'Answer' sections are always present and in that order.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)#\\s*Answer\"s\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n(.*)\"s\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer sections\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        error(\"Question or Answer section not found in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question_match[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining regex patterns for the Question and Answer sections, then using Julia's `match` function to find the first match of each pattern in the markdown text. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text. If the 'Question' or 'Answer' section is not found, the function throws an error.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the 'Question' section ends where the 'Answer' section begins, and that the 'Answer' section continues to the end of the text. If your markdown text is structured differently, you may need to adjust the regex patterns.\n\nAs per your instructions, I haven't used any external packages, and I've used general type annotations for the function arguments and return values. This function should be reasonably performant, but if you're processing very large markdown texts, you might want to consider a more efficient parsing strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[404,471],"elapsed":11.250924084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":735055733,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
