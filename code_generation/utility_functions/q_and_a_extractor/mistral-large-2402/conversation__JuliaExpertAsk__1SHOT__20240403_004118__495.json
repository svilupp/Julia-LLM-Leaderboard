The `startswith` function is used to check if a line starts with a specific string. When a line is identified as a question or answer line, it is added to the corresponding array after stripping leading and trailing whitespace using the `strip` function. Finally, the question and answer lines are joined into single strings using the `join` function and returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[136,322],"elapsed":8.154369584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":521833811,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
