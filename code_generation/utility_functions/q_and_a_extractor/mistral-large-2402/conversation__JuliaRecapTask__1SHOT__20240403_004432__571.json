[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write a function in Julia to extract questions and answers from a markdown formatted text. Here's a simple function that uses Julia's built-in regular expressions and string manipulation functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?s)#\\s*Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|\\z)\"\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer\n    question = strip(match(question_regex, md)[1])\n    answer = strip(match(answer_regex, md)[1])\n\n    # Return a tuple of Question and Answer\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining two regular expressions that match the Question and Answer sections of the markdown text. The `(?s)` at the start of the regular expressions is a flag that makes the `.` character match newline characters as well, which allows us to match multi-line sections. The `(.*?)` part of the regular expressions matches any text, and the `(?=\\n#\\s*Answer|\\z)` and `(?=\\n#|\\z)` parts are positive lookaheads that ensure the matched text is followed by a new section or the end of the string.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text. The `match` function is used to find the first match of the regular expression in the string, and the `[1]` index is used to extract the matched text.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[402,422],"elapsed":10.680489333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-787851862,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
