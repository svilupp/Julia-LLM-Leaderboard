X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We will be using regular expressions to identify and capture the content within these sections. Here's how we'll go about it:\n\n### Problem Solving Steps:\n\n1. **Recall Julia Snippets**:\n   - Regular Expressions: Julia provides the `r\"x\"` syntax for regex, and we can use functions like `match` and `eachmatch` from `Base`.\n   - String manipulation: Use functions like `strip` to clean strings.\n   - Tuples: Easy to form with `(a, b)` syntax.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - Use regular expressions to identify the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections.\n   - Extract text between these identified headings.\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n   - Return a tuple containing the question and answer content.\n\n3. **Double-check**:\n   - Ensure we handle cases where either section might be missing.\n   - Consider edge cases like multiple sections or erroneous formatting.\n\nHere's the function implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to capture sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n\\s*#\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\\s*#?\"\n\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the captured content and strip whitespaces\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introductory section that does not need to be extracted.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Conclusion\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regex Patterns**: \n  - `# Question\\n(.*?)\\n\\s*#`: Matches from \"# Question\" header to before the next header. `(.*?)` captures any minimal content lazily.\n  - `# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\\s*#`: Similarly, captures the content after the \"# Answer\" header.\n- **`match`**:\n  - Finds the first occurrence of the pattern in the markdown text.\n- **Strip**:\n  - `strip` is used to clean the captured text of leading and trailing newlines or spaces.\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If a section is missing, we handle it by returning empty strings for that part of the tuple.\n\nThis solution efficiently searches the text for the required sections, ensuring both robustness and clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[348,583],"elapsed":7.384680125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":554558870,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
