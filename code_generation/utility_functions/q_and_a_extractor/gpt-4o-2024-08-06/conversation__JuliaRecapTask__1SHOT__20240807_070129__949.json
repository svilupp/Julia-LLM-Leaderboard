[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, let's break down the problem and create a systematic approach to extracting the desired sections from the markdown text. \n\n### Steps to Solve Task:\n\n1. **Identify the Section Headers:** Find where the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers begin within the given markdown text.\n\n2. **Extract Text in Each Section:** Once the headers are found, extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` for the question part and between `# Answer` and the end of the document (or the next section) for the answer part.\n\n3. **Strip Leading and Trailing Spaces/Newlines:** Ensure that any text extracted from these sections has no leading or trailing spaces or newlines.\n\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Return the question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString) :: Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Define the markers for the sections\n    question_marker = \"# Question\"\n    answer_marker = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    # Find indices where the question and answer sections begin\n    question_start = findfirst(occursin(question_marker), eachline(md))\n    answer_start = findfirst(occursin(answer_marker), eachline(md))\n    \n    if ismissing(question_start) || ismissing(answer_start)\n        error(\"The provided markdown does not contain required Question and Answer sections.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the portion of markdown which is related to questions and answers\n    question_lines = split(md, \"\\n\")[question_start + 1:answer_start - 1]\n    answer_lines = split(md, \"\\n\")[answer_start + 1:end]\n\n    # Strip and combine lines\n    question = join(strip.(question_lines), \"\\n\") |> strip\n    answer = join(strip.(answer_lines), \"\\n\") |> strip\n    \n    # Return the result as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Markers Definition:** We define the headers `# Question` and `# Answer` as markers to identify where each section starts.\n- **Finding Section Indices:** Use `findfirst` and `occursin` on `eachline(md)` to find which line starts each section.\n- **Extract Sectional Content:** Extract the relevant lines for each section by finding lines between the markers.\n- **Stripping and Combining:** We use `strip` to remove unnecessary spaces and `join` to recombine lines of each section into a single string.\n- **Error Handling:** If either the `# Question` or `# Answer` markers are missing, the function raises an error to indicate that required sections are missing.\n- **Tuple Formation:** Finally, combine the stripped question and answer into a tuple.\n\nThis function will accurately extract the text located within the sections marked by `# Question` and `# Answer` and return them in the specified format while ensuring any leading or trailing whitespaces/newlines are removed.","status":200,"tokens":[348,624],"elapsed":6.284617417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":34690494,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
