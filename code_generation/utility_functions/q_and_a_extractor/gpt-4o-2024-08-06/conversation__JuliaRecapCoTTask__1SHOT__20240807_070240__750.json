[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem systematically, let's follow the outlined problem-solving steps.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\nWe need to:\n- Read and process strings, which involves slicing and searching.\n- Use Julia's string functions such as `findfirst` for finding indices of substrings, and `strip` for removing leading and trailing whitespace.\n- Ensure the logic correctly identifies sections with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Handle multi-line strings and take into account sections of markdown text starting with particular headers.\n  \n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe'll implement a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer sections. Here's how the implementation might look:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find the start indices of the Question and Answer sections\n    question_start_idx = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start_idx = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    # Make sure both sections exist\n    if question_start_idx === nothing || answer_start_idx === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown input must contain both '# Question' and '# Answer' sections.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the text between question and answer sections and after answer section\n    question_text = \"\"\n    answer_text = \"\"\n\n    question_end_idx = answer_start_idx - 1\n    question_section = md[question_start_idx + length(\"# Question\"):question_end_idx]\n    question_text = strip(question_section)\n\n    answer_end_idx = length(md)\n    answer_section = md[answer_start_idx + length(\"# Answer\"):answer_end_idx]\n    answer_text = strip(answer_section)\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n\n- **Ensure correctness**: The function checks for the presence of both markers and extracts content correctly. Utilize `strip` to clean any extra spaces or newlines.\n  \n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If either `# Question` or `# Answer` is missing, it correctly throws an error.\n  - The function can handle markdown with only a single question and single answer.\n  - Properly manages multi-line text extraction for both sections.\n \n- **Testing**: Write unit tests to validate with different scenarios, such as normal input, missing sections, and extra spaces.\n\nThis function effectively captures the required text by locating header indices and correctly slicing and stripping the extracted sections for the required output.","status":200,"tokens":[349,506],"elapsed":5.20238125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1767719503,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
