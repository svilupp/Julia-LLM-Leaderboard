[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Specifically, we're interested in text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings. Here's the organized plan and solution:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Sections:** We have to locate the positions of the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers in the markdown string.\n2. **Extract Text:** Once identified, extract text between these headers respectively for Question and Answer.\n3. **Clean Text:** Strip off any leading or trailing spaces and newlines in the extracted text.\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Combine the cleaned question and answer into a tuple and return it.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Each section header like `# Question` and `# Answer` appears exactly once and in that order.\n\n### Snippets to Use\n\n- **String Functions:** Use `startswith`, `find`, and slicing to locate and extract parts of the string.\n- **Regex (if necessary):** If the task required finding headers abstractly, `r””` and matching could be used.\n- **Trim Functions:** `strip()` to remove unwanted whitespace.\n\nNow, let’s implement this in a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find index positions of the section headers\n    q_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    a_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Validate if both headers are present\n    if q_start === nothing || a_start === nothing || q_start > a_start\n        return (\"\", \"\")  # Or could throw an error if preferred\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text after headers\n    question_content = strip(md[(q_start + length(\"# Question\")):a_start - 1])\n    answer_content = strip(md[(a_start + length(\"# Answer\")):end])\n    \n    return (question_content, answer_content)\nend\n```\n\n### Double Checking\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the solution:\n- **Boundary Cases:** Check if the headers are at the start or end of the string.\n- **Whitespace and Line Breaks:** Confirm these are stripped appropriately.\n- **Order Assurance:** Confirm `# Question` comes before `# Answer`.\n\nThis solution should efficiently extract and clean the content based on given Markdown text constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[349,494],"elapsed":4.964531666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":414181591,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
