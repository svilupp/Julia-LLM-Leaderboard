It captures everything between `# Question` and `# Answer` for the question and everything after `# Answer` for the answer, ensuring leading and trailing whitespace is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[125,243],"elapsed":3.520478125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-766121881,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
