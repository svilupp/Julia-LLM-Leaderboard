Define regex patterns to identify `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n  2. Use `match` function to locate these sections in `md`.\n  3. Extract and strip the question and answer using captured groups.\n  4. Return these as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[210,289],"elapsed":3.933827458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-164372197,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
