[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, we'll parse the markdown to find the sections labeled as `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's the approach:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task:\n\n1. **Identify Sections:** We'll need to locate the lines starting with `#` that denote the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections, respectively.\n2. **Extract Text:** Once these sections are located, we'll extract all the text between the relevant headers.\n3. **Strip Unnecessary Characters:** Ensure that any leading or trailing spaces and newlines are removed from both extracted sections.\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Finally, return the extracted question and answer text as a tuple.\n\n### Julia Code Implementation\n\nLet's implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_header = \"# Question\"\n    answer_header = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    question_start = findfirst(line -> startswith(strip(line), question_header), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_start = findfirst(line -> startswith(strip(line), answer_header), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Either the Question or Answer header is missing.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract lines of the question and answer, separated from markdown\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question_lines = lines[question_start + 1 : answer_start - 1]\n    answer_lines = lines[answer_start + 1 : end]\n    \n    # Strip leading/trailing spaces and newlines from sections\n    question_text = strip(join(question_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer_lines, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **String Splitting:** We split the input markdown string by newlines to easily locate section headers and their contents.\n- **Finding Headers:** We locate the indices of the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections using `findfirst` combined with a lambda that checks if a line starts with the target header.\n- **Section Extraction:** Using the indices, we extract the lines residing between these headers for both questions and answers.\n- **Whitespace Handling:** `strip` is used to remove leading/trailing spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n- **Error Handling:** The function raises an error if either section is missing.\n\nThis implementation should be efficient and obeys the provided constraints.
