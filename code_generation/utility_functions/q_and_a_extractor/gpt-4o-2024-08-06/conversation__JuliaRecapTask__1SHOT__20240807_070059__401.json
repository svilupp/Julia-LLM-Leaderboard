[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\nTo solve this problem, we need:\n- String manipulation capabilities to locate and extract sections.\n- The `strip` function to remove leading and trailing spaces or newlines from strings.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nHere's how we can implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find the position of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Ensure both sections exist\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both '# Question' and '# Answer' must be present in the input.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the question text\n    question_end = answer_start - 1\n    raw_question = md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):question_end]\n    question = strip(raw_question) # Removing leading/trailing spaces/newlines\n    \n    # Extract the answer text\n    answer_end = length(md)\n    raw_answer = md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):answer_end]\n    answer = strip(raw_answer) # Similarly, strip leading/trailing spaces/newlines\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\nBased on the requirements:\n- We identify and validate the presence of both required sections.\n- Leverage `findfirst` to locate the beginning of these sections.\n- Use slicing to extract the relevant parts.\n- Strip unwanted whitespace to clean up the extracted text.\n\nThis function should work for any markdown-formatted string with `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. It returns a tuple of strings representing the question and answer texts.\n\nHere's how you might test the function:\n\n```julia\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")  # Expected: \"What is the capital of France?\"\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")      # Expected: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient, using string operations that are well-suited for the task.","status":200,"tokens":[348,510],"elapsed":4.656857625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-528871844,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
