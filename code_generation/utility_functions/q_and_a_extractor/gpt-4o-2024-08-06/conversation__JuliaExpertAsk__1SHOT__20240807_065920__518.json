Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can utilize regular expressions (regex) to efficiently locate and extract the text in the desired sections. Below is a concise implementation in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(?=# Answer|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    \n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Patterns**:\n  - `question_pattern`: It captures text following `# Question` up to either `# Answer` section or the end of the string.\n  - `answer_pattern`: It captures text following `# Answer` up to any subsequent section header or the end of the string.\n  \n- **Matching and Extraction**:\n  - `match` function is used to apply the patterns to the `md` text.\n  - `captures[1]`: This retrieves the matched content of the capturing group from the match result. If `match` is successful, it indicates the captured section's content.\n  \n- **Strip**:\n  - Usage of `strip` ensures any leading or trailing spaces and newlines are removed from the extracted strings.\n  \n- **Handling Missing Sections**:\n  - If either section is missing, the function defaults to an empty string for that section in the tuple.\n\nThis approach is efficient and concise, effectively handling typical markdown scenario parsing.","status":200,"tokens":[125,359],"elapsed":4.587194083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":750924690,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
