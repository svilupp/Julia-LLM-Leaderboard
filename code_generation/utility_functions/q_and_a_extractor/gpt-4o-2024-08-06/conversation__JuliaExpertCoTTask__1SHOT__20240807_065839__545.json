We need to extract the text following the `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Parsing Approach**:\n   - Use regular expressions to identify and capture content after `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - Strip leading and trailing spaces/newlines from extracted strings.\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Define a function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n   - Use a regular expression to match and capture relevant portions.\n   - Return the captured portions as a tuple.\n4. **Validation**: Test the function with provided data and any edge cases identified.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s+([\\s\\S]*?)\\n# Answer\", md)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s+([\\s\\S]*?)\\n?$\", md)\n    \n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Testing with provided data\ntest_md = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(test_md))  # Should output (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n## Verification\n\n- Test the function with provided data.\n- Consider edge cases without specified sections, or with multiple newline breaks.\n- Ensure the function correctly captures question and answer content and returns them stripped and clean.","status":200,"tokens":[210,352],"elapsed":4.59609975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":343852020,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
