[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's how we can systematically approach this task:\n\n## Problem Solving Steps\n\n1. **Identify Sections:** We need to locate where the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections begin. We'll split the text based on these headers.\n2. **Extract Text:** Once we locate the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections, we'll then extract and store the content for each section in variables.\n3. **Strip Unwanted Characters:** Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted sections.\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Finally, return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown based on sections\n    sections = split(md, r\"# (Question|Answer)\")\n    questions_and_answers = filter(s -> length(s) > 0, strip.(sections))\n    \n    # Ensure the output tuple has exactly two elements: question and answer\n    # The structure assumes that the markdown is well-structured: \n    # The first capture will always be the question, followed by the answer.\n    if length(questions_and_answers) != 2\n        error(\"The markdown does not contain appropriate Question and Answer sections.\")\n    end\n\n    question = questions_and_answers[1]\n    answer = questions_and_answers[2]\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`split(md, r\"# (Question|Answer)\")`:** Splits the markdown text into parts using a regex that matches either `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n- **`strip(sections)`:** Removes leading and trailing spaces and newlines from each extracted section.\n- **`filter`:** Ensures we only keep non-empty sections.\n- **Validity Check:** Assert that the split leads to exactly two non-empty sections.\n\nThis implementation assumes a straightforward markdown structure with exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer`. It handles and returns these sections efficiently in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[349,458],"elapsed":5.86866925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":648924620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
