[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we need to process the provided markdown-formatted text and extract the contents within the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections. We will be looking for markdown headers (e.g., `# Question` and `# Answer`) to identify the sections.\n\n**Steps to Implement `q_and_a_extractor`:**\n\n1. **Identify Sections:** We will look for the lines equal to `# Question` and `# Answer` to pinpoint the start of each section.\n\n2. **Extract Content:** Once we find a section header, we keep collecting lines until we encounter the next section header or end of the text.\n\n3. **Strip Whitespace:** After collecting the content, we'll strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the question and answer strings.\n\n4. **Return as Tuple:** Finally, we'll return the extracted question and answer as a tuple in the format `(question, answer)`.\n\nWe need to consider:\n- The text following a `# Question` or `# Answer` line should be part of the respective section until another header is encountered.\n- Empty sections should simply yield empty strings after stripping.\n\nHere is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if stripped_line == \"# Question\"\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n            continue\n        elseif stripped_line == \"# Answer\"\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if current_section == \"Question\"\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip any leading or trailing newlines and spaces from question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We split the markdown text into lines for easier processing.\n- We iterate through these lines and check if they indicate the beginning of a \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section.\n- Based on the current section we're in, we append lines to either the `question` or `answer` variable. The content accumulation uses `\"*=\\n\"` to ensure each line ends correctly.\n- Finally, after collection, both `question` and `answer` are stripped of leading/trailing whitespace and newlines before being returned as a tuple.\n\nThis implementation ensures correct extraction and formatting according to the given markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[348,538],"elapsed":6.263920584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-320174396,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
