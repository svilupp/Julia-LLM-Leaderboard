Below is a straightforward implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Formatting: strformat\nusing Compat.Markdown: Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Use regular expression to capture text after \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s+((?:[^\\n#][^\\n]*(?:\\n|$))*)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s+((?:[^\\n#][^\\n]*(?:\\n|$))*)\"\n\n    # Extracting question using regex\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    # Extracting answer using regex\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown string `md` and returns a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n- We use regular expressions to locate each section:\n  - `# Question` is followed by text until another `#` starts a new section or the string ends. We capture this text.\n  - `# Answer` is treated similarly.\n- `strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text for a cleaner output.\n- We handle scenarios where either section might be missing by checking if a match was found and defaulting to an empty string if not.\n\nThis implementation will extract the relevant sections with leading spaces and newlines stripped, providing a clean tuple of the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[125,448],"elapsed":5.49078925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2000098085,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
