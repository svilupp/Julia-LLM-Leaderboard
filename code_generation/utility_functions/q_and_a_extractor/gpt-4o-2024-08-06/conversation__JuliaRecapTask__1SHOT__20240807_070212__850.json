[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to process the markdown-formatted text, extract the sections under headings `# Question` and `# Answer`, and return the content of these sections in a cleaned format as a tuple. Here's how we can systematically approach this problem:\n\n### Problem Solving Steps\n\n1. **Identify the Sections**: We need to find the positions in the text where `# Question` and `# Answer` start.\n\n2. **Extract Text**: Once the header positions are identified, extract the text following these headers until the next header or the end of the text. This means:\n   - Extract the text starting after `# Question` until `# Answer`.\n   - Extract the text starting after `# Answer` until the next section header or the end of the document.\n\n3. **Clean the Text**: For both question and answer sections, strip out any leading or trailing whitespace and newline characters.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Package these two cleaned strings into a tuple and return.\n\nLet's implement this in the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_heading = \"# Question\"\n    answer_heading = \"# Answer\"\n    \n    # Find indices for question and answer headings\n    question_start = findfirst(question_heading, md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(answer_heading, md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Required sections not found in the markdown text.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the start indices right after each heading\n    question_content_start = question_start + length(question_heading)\n    answer_content_start = answer_start + length(answer_heading)\n    \n    # Extract till next heading or end of doc\n    rest_of_text_after_question = md[question_content_start:end]\n    rest_of_text_after_answer = md[answer_content_start:end]\n    \n    next_heading_after_question = findfirst(\"#\", rest_of_text_after_question)\n    next_heading_after_answer = findfirst(\"#\", rest_of_text_after_answer)\n    \n    if next_heading_after_question !== nothing\n        question_content = strip(rest_of_text_after_question[1:next_heading_after_question-1])\n    else\n        question_content = strip(rest_of_text_after_question)\n    end\n    \n    if next_heading_after_answer !== nothing\n        answer_content = strip(rest_of_text_after_answer[1:next_heading_after_answer-1])\n    else\n        answer_content = strip(rest_of_text_after_answer)\n    end\n\n    return (question_content, answer_content)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **findfirst**: It is used to locate the starting index of the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings. If not found, the function raises an error.\n  \n- **String Slicing**: After identifying the headings, we determine the start of text relevant to each section using string slicing and character index arithmetic.\n\n- **Next Heading**: We look for the next `#` after each heading and slice text between the two headings or until the end of the document.\n\n- **strip**: Used to remove any leading or trailing spaces/newlines to clean up the extracted sections.\n\nThis implementation diligently follows the given task requirements, adhering to Julia syntax and features.","status":200,"tokens":[348,659],"elapsed":8.143777833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":820246613,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
