[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, we will parse the markdown text to identify sections that begin with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Our approach will involve:\n\n- Splitting the input text by lines to process it line-by-line.\n- Iterating through the lines to detect the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections.\n- Accumulating lines until the next section header or the end of the document is reached.\n- Returning the accumulated text for each section in a tuple, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.\n\nLet's proceed to implement this logic in the `q_and_a_extractor` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text by lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    # Iterate over each line\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)  # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n        \n        # Check the start of the Question section\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        # Check the start of the Answer section\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Accumulate text in the corresponding section\n        if in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Trim any trailing newlines from question and answer text\n    question = strip(question, '\\n')\n    answer = strip(answer, '\\n')\n    \n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-checking the solution:\n\n- **Initial Splitting:** We ensure that lines are processed to detect headers accurately.\n- **Header Detection:** We use `startswith` to identify whether a line declares the start of a `Question` or `Answer` section.\n- **Text Accumulation:** Text is aggregated into the respective sections while we ensure no extra spaces or formatting issues are introduced.\n- **Whitespaces Handling:** The stripping at various stages ensures no unintended spaces or newlines appear.\n- **Output Structure:** The function outputs a tuple `(question, answer)` as requested.\n\nThe implementation effectively parses the markdown text, extracts the desired sections, and assures that extraneous formatting is removed from the captured text.","status":200,"tokens":[349,526],"elapsed":5.217360583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-10263894,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
