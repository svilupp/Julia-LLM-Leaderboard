[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll write a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the content from sections in a markdown-formatted text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here is how we can systematically approach this:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Sections**: We will look for the headers `# Question` and `# Answer` in the given markdown text to find the relevant sections.\n2. **Extract the Content**: Once the sections are identified, extract the text following these headers.\n3. **Clean Up the Text**: Strip any leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. **Return as a Tuple**: The extracted and cleaned question and answer will be returned as a tuple.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function considering the above steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Ensure markdown text is parsed line by line\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Variables to store extracted question and answer\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    \n    # Flags to know whether we're in Question or Answer section\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n    \n    # Loop through each line, extracting content between Question and Answer headings\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false   # End answer section\n            question = \"\"       # Reset previous question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false # End question section\n            answer = \"\"         # Reset previous answer\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= (question == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * line\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= (answer == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces or newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Splitting the Text**: The markdown input is split into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`, which facilitates line-by-line processing.\n- **Identifying Sections**: Using `startswith`, we identify the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Flags `in_question` and `in_answer` help manage state transitions between these sections.\n- **Appending Content**: Directly after encountering a `# Question` or `# Answer`, any following lines are appended to the `question` or `answer` variable until another section starts.\n- **Stripping Whitespaces**: Finally, both the extracted question and answer are cleaned up using `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces or newlines before being returned as a tuple.\n\nThis solution is reliable for markdown text structures as described, effectively parsing and returning necessary information.","status":200,"tokens":[348,597],"elapsed":7.667129375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-786374429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
