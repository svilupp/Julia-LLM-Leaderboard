When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Problem Solving Steps\n\n1. **Understand the format:** The markdown text has sections clearly delineated by headers like `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Reading and extracting text:** Use regular expressions to capture the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings.\n3. **Strip extraneous characters:** Ensure that leading spaces and newlines are removed from the extracted text.\n4. **Return result:** Return the extracted texts as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Function Implementation\n\nWe'll employ regular expressions to efficiently capture the required text sections. \n\nHere's the function implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Use a regex pattern to capture text between `# Question` and `# Answer`\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\n# Answer\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*([\\s\\S]*)\"\n    \n    # Find the question text\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Find the answer text\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Test the Function\n\nNow, verify the solution using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Check Solution\n\n- **Correctness:** The function is expected to accurately extract and strip the text between the specified markdown headings.\n- **Edge Cases:** Consider scenarios where \"Question\" or \"Answer\" is missing; the function should handle these by returning empty strings for missing sections.\n- **Efficiency:** The approach is efficient given the simple input format.\n\nThe function has been thoroughly implemented considering the problem requirements, ensuring correctness and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[210,447],"elapsed":4.425891958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1789912780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
