Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, we'll proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: We'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor(md::String)` to process the markdown-formatted text.\n2. **Find the Sections**: Use regular expressions or simple string operations to locate the beginning of the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n3. **Extract Content**: Extract text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers, and then from `# Answer` to the end of the text.\n4. **Trim Whitespace**: Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted question and answer.\n5. **Return as Tuple**: Package the extracted content into a tuple and return it.\n\nLet's write the code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing || answer_start <= question_start\n        return (\"\", \"\")  # Return empty tuple if structure is not valid\n    end\n\n    # Extracting question and answer\n    question = strip(md[question_start+length(\"# Question\"):answer_start-1])\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start+length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n**Solution Verification**:\n\nTest the function using the data provided:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis solution identifies and extracts the text between markdown headers and processes it according to the problem statement, returning a tuple with the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[210,386],"elapsed":5.255313083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1496053911,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
