Here is a concise implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia. It leverages regular expressions to accurately capture the text sections between the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)\\s*(?=# Answer)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*(.+)\\s*\"\n    question = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    return (strip(question[1]), strip(answer[1]))\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines two regular expression patterns:\n\n- `question_pattern` to capture text between `# Question` and just before `# Answer`.\n- `answer_pattern` to capture text following `# Answer`.\n\nThe `match` function is used to extract the relevant content, and `strip` ensures the removal of any leading/trailing spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[125,194],"elapsed":1.963901208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2120397161,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
