[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to extract specific sections from markdown-formatted text. Let's go through the problem-solving steps:\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\n1. **Regular Expressions**: We can use Julia's regex capabilities to detect the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.\n2. **String Manipulation**: Functions like `strip` can help remove leading and trailing whitespace or newlines.\n3. **String Matching and Extraction**: Using functions like `findnext`, which finds the position of strings, and `match` for regex matches, to navigate and capture relevant sections.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nHere's how we can implement the `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use regex to find the sections and content\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*# Answer\", md, s=1)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)(?:#|$)\", md, s=1)\n    \n    # Extract content from captures\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n- **Extraction Logic**: We use non-greedy matches `(.*?)` to capture content between headers without overshooting to the wrong section.\n- **Edge Cases Considered**: \n  - No `# Answer` section: Captures until the end of the string.\n  - If no content is found, defaults to an empty string.\n- **Stripping**: We ensure output is free from leading and trailing whitespace or newline using `strip`.\n\nThis implementation captures the content between the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers correctly. Let's make sure examples are handled well, including cases with additional newlines or spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[349,433],"elapsed":5.104469167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":574830599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
