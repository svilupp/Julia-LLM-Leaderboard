[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow the structured approach:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets\nFor this task, we'll need:\n- String manipulation functions: `split`, `strip`, and `findfirst`.\n- Tuples for returning the two strings.\n  \n### Solve the Task\nWe will parse the markdown text to extract sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`. We'll use `split`, `findfirst`, and string slicing to extract the required parts.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Find the indices where Question and Answer sections start\n    question_start_idx = findfirst(x -> strip(x) == \"# Question\", lines)\n    answer_start_idx = findfirst(x -> strip(x) == \"# Answer\", lines)\n    \n    # Check that both Question and Answer sections are found\n    if question_start_idx === nothing || answer_start_idx === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown text must contain both # Question and # Answer sections.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text in the Question section\n    question_content = strip(join(lines[question_start_idx + 1:answer_start_idx - 1], \"\\n\"))\n    \n    # Extract text in the Answer section\n    answer_content = strip(join(lines[answer_start_idx + 1:end], \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return (question_content, answer_content)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-Check the Solution\n- We used `split` to break the text into lines for easy parsing.\n- `findfirst` helps locate the indices for the start of the `Question` and `Answer` sections.\n- `strip` is used to remove leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n- Proper error handling ensures both sections exist before processing.\n\nThis function should now correctly extract and return the text within the requested sections.","status":200,"tokens":[349,396],"elapsed":4.135748333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-52307820,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
