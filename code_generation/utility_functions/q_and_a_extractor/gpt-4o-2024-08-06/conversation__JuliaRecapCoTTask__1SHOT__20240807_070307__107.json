[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's tackle this task step-by-step:\n\n### Key Julia Snippets\n\n1. **Reading Lines**: We use `split(io, \"\\n\")` to split markdown text into lines.\n2. **Iterating Through Lines**: We will use a for loop to traverse through this list to identify relevant sections.\n3. **String Matching and Extraction**: Using Julia's `startswith(line, \"# Question\")` and `startswith(line, \"# Answer\")` to determine when a new section begins.\n4. **String Trimming**: Use `strip()` to remove unnecessary white spaces and newlines.\n\n### Approach\n\nWe'll identify and extract the contents of markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` by reading the file line by line, storing relevant text, and returning them in a tuple.\n\n### Solution Implementation\n\nHere is how we can implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    current_section = \"\"\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    collect_section = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n            collect_section = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n            collect_section = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"#\")\n            collect_section = false\n        end\n\n        if collect_section\n            if current_section == \"Question\"\n                question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n                answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Line Splitting**: The input markdown string `md` is split into lines to handle each one separately.\n- **Section Identification**: As we iterate through lines, `startswith` checks for the beginning of a \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section. When a new section starts, we stop adding to the previous section and start collecting text for the new one.\n- **Text Collection and Trimming**: Text is collected into `question` and `answer` and finally trimmed of any superfluous whitespace using `strip`.\n\nThis solution is clear, efficient, and directly adheres to the provided guidelines. It's designed to handle markdown with multiple headers by stopping text collection when encountering a new heading, ensuring only the text between the specified headers is captured.","status":200,"tokens":[349,528],"elapsed":4.504968333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1981035876,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
