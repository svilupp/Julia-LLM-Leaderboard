The function will return a tuple containing the question and answer text. Below is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Define regex patterns to extract Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)(?=# Answer|$(?![\\s\\S]))\"ms\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*)$\"ms\n\n    # Find the question using the regex pattern\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    # Find the answer using the regex pattern\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use regular expressions to capture text following the headers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- We apply `strip` to ensure that leading and trailing spaces or newlines are removed from the extracted text.\n- We use `match` to apply our regex patterns, checking if a match was found and then using `captures` to extract the matched content.\n- We return a tuple containing the stripped question and answer.\n\nThis solution assumes there's only one \"Question\" and \"Answer\" section in the input markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[125,317],"elapsed":4.336123125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-946330769,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
