Here's how you can implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Match Question section\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)\", md, dotall=true)\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Match Answer section\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s*(.+?)(?=#+|$)\", md, dotall=true)\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Regex for Question Matching**: \n  - `r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)(?=# Answer|$)\"`: \n    - This regex looks for the `# Question` followed by any text (. is any character, `+?` is a non-greedy match to get minimal content up until).\n    - `(?=# Answer|$)` is a positive lookahead that checks if the next section is `# Answer` or the end of the string `$`.\n\n- **Regex for Answer Matching**: \n  - `r\"# Answer\\s*(.+?)(?=#+|$)\"`: \n    - This searches for `# Answer` followed by any characters, up to the next header or end of the string.\n    - `(?=#+|$)` means any new header (indicated by `#+`) or end of file.\n\n- **String Manipulation**:\n  - `strip(...)` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines from the captured sections.\n\nBy using this function, you'll extract and clean up the text content of the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections efficiently.\n\nMake sure to test it with various inputs to ensure it captures the sections correctly, particularly around boundary cases like when the `# Question` or `# Answer` sections might be missing.","status":200,"tokens":[125,433],"elapsed":3.803462375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-776125387,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
