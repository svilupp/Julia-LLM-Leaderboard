[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of extracting text from the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in a markdown document, we'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor`. The approach involves:\n\n1. Splitting the markdown content based on the headers.\n2. Identifying the sections using start markers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extracting the text following these headers until the next header or the end of the content.\n4. Stripping any leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from the extracted question and answer.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # This function extracts the text following \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers\n    # Define a function to find and extract content after a specific header\n    function extract_content(text::AbstractString, header::AbstractString)\n        # Find the index of the header in the text\n        header_index = findfirst(Occursin(header), text)\n        if header_index === nothing\n            return \"\"\n        end\n        # Extract content after the specified header until the end or next header start\n        start_idx = header_index + length(header) + 1 # +1 to skip the newline\n        # Find the next occurrence of any header\n        end_idx = findnext(text, \"#\", start_idx)\n        if end_idx === nothing\n            end_idx = length(text) + 1\n        end\n        # Extract the substring and strip the whitespace and newlines\n        return strip(text[start_idx:end_idx - 1])\n    end\n    \n    question = extract_content(md, \"# Question\")\n    answer = extract_content(md, \"# Answer\")\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **extract_content function:** This inner function handles the extraction from the markdown text, given a header like `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n  - It finds the location of the header using `findfirst`.\n  - It calculates `start_idx` right after the header and a newline.\n  - It searches for the next header starting with `#` to determine `end_idx`.\n  - Sub-string extraction is done from `start_idx` to `end_idx`, and the result is stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace with `strip`.\n\n- **q_and_a_extractor function:** This is the main function that organizes how the extraction occurs for both sections and returns the results in a tuple.\n\nThis function effectively handles separation and extraction, ensuring the correct sections are returned while complying with markdown formatting conventions.","status":200,"tokens":[349,517],"elapsed":6.530304458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2013908203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
