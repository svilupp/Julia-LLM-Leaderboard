Below is a function `q_and_a_extractor` that processes markdown text and extracts content between the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer content, with leading and trailing spaces or newlines removed.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_section = match(r\"# Question\\s(.*?)\\s*(?=(# Answer|$))\", md, s=1)\n    answer_section = match(r\"# Answer\\s(.*?)\\s*(?=(# \\w+|$))\", md, s=1)\n    \n    question = question_section !== nothing ? strip(question_section.match[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_section !== nothing ? strip(answer_section.match[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- It uses regular expressions to locate the sections marked by `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- The `match` function is used to find and extract the text between these headers.\n- The `strip` function is applied to remove unwanted spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n- The function handles cases where either section might be missing by checking if the `match` object is `nothing`.\n\nYou can call this function with a markdown string as an argument to get the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[125,281],"elapsed":3.991592917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1671825640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
