The `(?s)` flag enables dot-all mode, allowing the dot to match newlines. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[129,183],"elapsed":3.277436167,"cost":0.0031320000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24815,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
