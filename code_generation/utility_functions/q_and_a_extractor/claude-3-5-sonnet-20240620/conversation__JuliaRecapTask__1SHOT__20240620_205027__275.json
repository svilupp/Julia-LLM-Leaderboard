[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)(?=# Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=# |\\z)\"s\n\n    # Extract question and answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # Process extracted text\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n\n2. We create two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex` matches text starting with \"# Question\" up to either \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_regex` matches text starting with \"# Answer\" up to either the next heading or the end of the string.\n\n3. We use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of each regex in the input text.\n\n4. We process the extracted text:\n   - If a match is found, we use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the captured text.\n   - If no match is found, we use an empty string as a default value.\n\n5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the processed question and answer.\n\nThis solution handles cases where:\n- The Question or Answer section might be missing\n- There might be additional content after the Answer section\n- There might be multiple newlines or spaces in the extracted text\n\nThe use of the `s` flag in the regex allows the dot (.) to match newline characters, ensuring that multi-line content is captured correctly.\n\nThis implementation should correctly extract the Question and Answer sections from the given markdown text, returning them as a tuple with leading spaces and newlines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[379,527],"elapsed":8.383157541,"cost":0.009042000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
