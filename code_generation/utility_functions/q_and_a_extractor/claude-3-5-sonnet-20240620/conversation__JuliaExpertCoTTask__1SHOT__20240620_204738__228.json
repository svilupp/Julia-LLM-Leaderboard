We need to create a function that takes a markdown-formatted string as input.\n2. We'll use regular expressions to extract the content between the headers.\n3. We'll strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n4. We'll return the result as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing RegexTools\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extract question\n    question_pattern = r\"(?<=# Question\\n)(.|\\n)*?(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    question = match(question_pattern, md)\n    question = question === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question.match)\n\n    # Extract answer\n    answer_pattern = r\"(?<=# Answer\\n)(.|\\n)*?(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    answer = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    answer = answer === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer.match)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function uses regular expressions to find the text between the headers. The `(?<=# Question\\n)` and `(?<=# Answer\\n)` are lookbehind assertions that ensure we start matching after the headers. The `(.|\\n)*?` matches any character (including newlines) non-greedily until we reach either another header `(?=\\n#)` or the end of the string `(?=$)`.\n\nWe use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n\nIf no match is found, we return an empty string for that part.\n\nThis solution should correctly extract the question and answer from the given markdown text and return them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[223,483],"elapsed":7.041395833,"cost":0.007914000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26138,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
