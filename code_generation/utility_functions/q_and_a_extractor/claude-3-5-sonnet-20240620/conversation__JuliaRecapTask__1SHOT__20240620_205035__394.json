[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns them as a tuple. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=# Answer|$)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#|$)\"\n    \n    # Extract Question\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    \n    # Extract Answer\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    \n    # Return the tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. We define two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex`: Matches content starting with \"# Question\" up to either \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_regex`: Matches content starting with \"# Answer\" up to either the next \"#\" or the end of the string.\n\n2. We use `match` function to find the first occurrence of each regex in the markdown text.\n\n3. For both question and answer, we check if a match was found:\n   - If found, we extract the content (first capture group) and `strip` it to remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n   - If not found, we use an empty string as a default value.\n\n4. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis function will work with various markdown formats, including:\n- When both Question and Answer sections are present\n- When only one section is present\n- When neither section is present (returns empty strings)\n- When there are multiple sections (it will extract the first occurrence of each)\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis implementation is efficient, clear, and uses Julia's standard libraries without additional packages. It also handles various edge cases and follows the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[379,582],"elapsed":7.792979833,"cost":0.009867,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21686,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
