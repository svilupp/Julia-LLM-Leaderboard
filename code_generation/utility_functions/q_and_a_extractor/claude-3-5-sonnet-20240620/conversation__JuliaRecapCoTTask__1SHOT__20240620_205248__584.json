[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"(?<=# Question\\n)(.|\\n)*?(?=(\\n#|$))\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?<=# Answer\\n)(.|\\n)*?(?=(\\n#|$))\"\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # If either section is not found, return empty string for that section\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.match)\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.match)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`.\n\n2. We create two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex`: Matches all text between \"# Question\\n\" and the next section header or end of string.\n   - `answer_regex`: Matches all text between \"# Answer\\n\" and the next section header or end of string.\n\n3. We use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of each regex in the input string.\n\n4. We handle cases where a section might not be found by using the ternary operator. If a match is found, we extract and strip the matched text. If not, we return an empty string.\n\n5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis implementation satisfies the requirements:\n- It extracts text from both Question and Answer sections.\n- It returns the result as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n- It strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n- It handles cases where one or both sections might be missing.\n\nThe use of regular expressions allows for efficient extraction of the required sections, even if there are other markdown sections present in the input text.","status":200,"tokens":[380,516],"elapsed":7.978207833,"cost":0.00888,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27258,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
