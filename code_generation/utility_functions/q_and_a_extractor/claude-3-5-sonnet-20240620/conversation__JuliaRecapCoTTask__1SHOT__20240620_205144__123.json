[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"(?s)# Question\\s*(.*?)(?=# Answer|$)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"(?s)# Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=#|\\z)\"\n    \n    # Extract Question and Answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract content and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`.\n\n2. We create two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Question\" up to either \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Answer\" up to either the next \"#\" or the end of the string.\n\n3. We use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of each regex in the input string.\n\n4. We extract the content from the matches:\n   - If a match is found, we take the first capture group (the content after the header).\n   - If no match is found, we use an empty string as a default value.\n\n5. We use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace from both the question and answer.\n\n6. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis implementation handles cases where either the Question or Answer section might be missing, and it correctly strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nTo test the function, you can use it like this:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Other Section\nThis section should be ignored.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThe function correctly extracts the Question and Answer sections, ignoring any other sections in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[380,629],"elapsed":8.647954125,"cost":0.010575000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
