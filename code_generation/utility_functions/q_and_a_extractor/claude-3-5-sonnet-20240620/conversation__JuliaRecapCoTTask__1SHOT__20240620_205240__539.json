[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)(?=# Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=# Question|\\z)\"s\n\n    # Extract question and answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # Process matches\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n\n2. We create two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Question\" up to the next \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Answer\" up to the next \"# Question\" or the end of the string.\n\n3. We use the `match` function to find the first occurrence of each pattern in the input string.\n\n4. We process the matches:\n   - If a match is found, we extract the captured group (the content after the heading) and strip leading/trailing whitespace.\n   - If no match is found, we use an empty string as a default value.\n\n5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis implementation handles the following cases:\n- Multiple Question-Answer pairs (it extracts the first occurrence of each)\n- Missing Question or Answer sections\n- Leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n\nTo test the function, you can use the following example:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question\nWho wrote \"Romeo and Juliet\"?\n\n# Answer\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function extracts the first Question-Answer pair, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[380,614],"elapsed":8.895316875,"cost":0.01035,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2369,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
