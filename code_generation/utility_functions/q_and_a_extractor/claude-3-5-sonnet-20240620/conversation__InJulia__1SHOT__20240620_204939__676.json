It uses `findfirst` to locate the start of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections.\n2. It uses `findnext` to find the next \"#\" after each section start, which indicates the end of the section.\n3. It extracts the text between the start and end of each section.\n4. If there's no end marker (i.e., no following \"#\"), it extracts text from the start marker to the end of the string.\n5. If a section is not found, it returns an empty string for that section.\n6. It uses `strip` to remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines from both the question and answer.\n7. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted and cleaned question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Other Section\nSome other content...\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThe function handles cases where either the Question or Answer section might be missing, or where they might be the last section in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[92,714],"elapsed":9.013735292,"cost":0.010986000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29753,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
