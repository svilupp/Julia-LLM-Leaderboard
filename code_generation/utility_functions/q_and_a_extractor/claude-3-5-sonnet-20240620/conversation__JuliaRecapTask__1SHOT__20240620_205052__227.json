[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! I'll create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text and returns them as a tuple. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to match Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)(?=#\\s*Answer|\\z)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=#|\\z)\"s\n\n    # Extract Question\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    question = question_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(question_match.captures[1])\n\n    # Extract Answer\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    answer = answer_match === nothing ? \"\" : strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. We define two regular expressions:\n   - `question_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Question\" up to either \"# Answer\" or the end of the string.\n   - `answer_regex`: Matches text starting with \"# Answer\" up to either the next \"#\" or the end of the string.\n\n2. We use `match` function to find the first occurrence of each regex in the input string.\n\n3. For both question and answer, we check if a match was found. If not, we assign an empty string. If found, we extract the captured group (the content after the header) and `strip` it to remove leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\n4. Finally, we return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nThis function handles cases where:\n- The Question or Answer section might be missing\n- There might be additional content after the Answer section\n- There might be multiple newlines or spaces in the extracted text\n\nTo use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Additional Information\nParis is also known as the City of Light.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThe function uses regular expressions for pattern matching, which is efficient for this task. It also uses abstract types (`AbstractString`) for better compatibility with different string types in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[379,579],"elapsed":8.155049208,"cost":0.009822000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20425,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
