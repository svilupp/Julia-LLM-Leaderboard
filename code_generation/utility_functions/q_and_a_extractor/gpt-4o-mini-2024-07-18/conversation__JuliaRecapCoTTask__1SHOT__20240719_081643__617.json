[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task of extracting questions and answers from markdown-formatted text, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall Useful Julia Snippets**: We will utilize functions for string manipulation, such as `split`, `strip`, and regular expressions for efficient text matching.\n\n2. **Implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function**: This function will search for sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, then extract the corresponding text.\n\n3. **Double-check the solution for correctness**: Make sure the extracted text is clean and properly formatted.\n\nNow let's implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the input markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check for question section\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false  # End any answer section if in question\n\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer_section = true\n            in_question_section = false  # End any question section if in answer\n\n        elseif in_question_section\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \" # Collect question text\n\n        elseif in_answer_section\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \" # Collect answer text\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return tuple with trimmed question and answer\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- We start by splitting the input text by newlines to process each line individually.\n- We maintain flags `in_question_section` and `in_answer_section` to keep track of when we are within these sections.\n- As we encounter each line, we determine if it's part of the question or answer section by checking if it starts with the respective header.\n- When we are inside a question or answer section, we accumulate the text, trimming any leading or trailing spaces and adding a space between lines.\n- Finally, we return a tuple containing the stripped question and answer.\n\n### Double-check the solution:\n\nWe should test the `q_and_a_extractor` function with various markdown-formatted strings to ensure it handles different scenarios correctly. Here are a few examples for testing:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nmd1 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Answer\nThis should not be captured.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the boiling point of water?\n\n# Answer\nThe boiling point of water is 100°C.\n\"\"\"\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat are the colors of the rainbow?\n# Answer\nRed, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Running the extractor\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md1))  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md2))  # Expected: (\"What is the boiling point of water?\", \"The boiling point of water is 100°C.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md3))  # Expected: (\"What are the colors of the rainbow?\", \"Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\")\n```\n\nThe implementation looks correct, and it should be able to extract questions and answers as specified, while also gracefully handling extra content around these sections.","status":200,"tokens":[349,729],"elapsed":13.025323209,"cost":0.00048975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1586839255,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
