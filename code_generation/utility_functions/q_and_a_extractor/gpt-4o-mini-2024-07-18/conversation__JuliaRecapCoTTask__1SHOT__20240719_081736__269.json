[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the problem of extracting the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from a markdown formatted text, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Recall Useful Julia Snippets**: \n   - We can use regular expressions to locate the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - We can utilize string functions like `strip`, `split`, and array/list comprehensions.\n\n2. **Define the Function**:\n   - We will create the function `q_and_a_extractor` which accepts a string `md` and extracts the necessary information.\n\n3. **Double-check the Solution**: \n   - Make sure to test the function with various cases to ensure robustness.\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the description.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer_section = true\n            in_question_section = false\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question_section\n            question *= stripped_line * \" \"  # Concatenate and add a space\n        elseif in_answer_section\n            answer *= stripped_line * \" \"  # Concatenate and add a space\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Final strip to remove unnecessary leading/trailing spaces\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\n What is the capital of France? \n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Test the function\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Should output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function reads each line of the markdown text.\n- It checks for the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers to toggle the section states.\n- When in the question section, it concatenates lines to form the complete question.\n- Similarly, it concatenates lines in the answer section.\n- It strips any leading or trailing spaces from the results before returning them.\n\n### Double-checking:\n- The returned tuple contains stripped strings of the question and answer.\n- Testing with different markdown formats (with multiple lines in questions/answers, extra spaces, etc.) should also be done to ensure flexibility.\n\nThis implementation should meet the requirements of the task effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[349,563],"elapsed":8.158350583,"cost":0.00039014999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1701049655,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
