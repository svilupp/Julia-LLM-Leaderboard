Identify the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text following each section while stripping unnecessary spaces and newlines.\n3. Return the result as a tuple of (question, answer).\n\nLet's implement the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize question and answer variables\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through the lines to find the question and answer\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        line = strip(lines[i])  # Strip leading/trailing whitespace\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(join(lines[(i+1):end]))  # Join remaining lines as question\n            question = strip(replace(question, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))  # Remove any answer header\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(join(lines[(i+1):end]))  # Join remaining lines as answer\n            answer = strip(replace(answer, \"# Question\" => \"\"))  # Remove any question header\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We split the markdown string into lines for easier processing.\n- We loop through each line to find the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- After finding those headers, we join the subsequent lines (skipping the header line itself) and clean up any additional headers that may appear.\n- Finally, we return a tuple containing the cleaned question and answer.\n\n### Check the solution:\nRun the test with the provided markdown string to ensure it works correctly. If the output is as expected, the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[210,463],"elapsed":7.292458959,"cost":0.0003093,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1637023573,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
