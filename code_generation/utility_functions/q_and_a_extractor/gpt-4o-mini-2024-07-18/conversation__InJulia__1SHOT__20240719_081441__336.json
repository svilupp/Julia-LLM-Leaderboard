We define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a `String` parameter `md`.\n2. We initialize arrays `questions` and `answers` to store the extracted questions and answers.\n3. We split the input markdown text into lines for easier processing.\n4. We iterate through each line, checking whether it denotes a question or answer section and stripping the appropriate headers.\n5. We also handle cases where questions or answers may span multiple lines.\n6. Finally, after going through all lines, we collect the questions and answers into a tuple and return them.\n\n### How to Use:\n- You can use the function by passing in a markdown-formatted string, and it will return a list of tuples containing each question and its corresponding answer. Each entry in the tuple is stripped of leading and trailing spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[92,739],"elapsed":10.301211084,"cost":0.0004572,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":662872599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
