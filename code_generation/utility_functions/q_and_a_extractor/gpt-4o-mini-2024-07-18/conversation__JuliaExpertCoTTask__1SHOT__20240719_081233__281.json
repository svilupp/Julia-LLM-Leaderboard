Define the function `q_and_a_extractor` which takes a markdown string as input.\n2. Use string manipulation methods to find the question and answer sections by searching for the identifiers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the text that follows each identifier, trim any leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input string into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables for question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Flags to indicate if we are capturing question or answer\n    capturing_question = false\n    capturing_answer = false\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines to find Question and Answer sections\n    for line in lines\n        trimmed_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(trimmed_line, \"# Question\")\n            capturing_question = true\n            capturing_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(trimmed_line, \"# Answer\")\n            capturing_question = false\n            capturing_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if capturing_question\n            question *= trimmed_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif capturing_answer\n            answer *= trimmed_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove any extraneous newline characters at the end\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\nprintln(result)  # Should output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nNext, I will check if the solution works correctly by running the function with the provided data and inspecting the output. The expected output is a tuple:\n\n```julia\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n``` \n\nThe implementation captures the question and answer as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[210,453],"elapsed":4.452309916,"cost":0.0003033,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1449901076,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
