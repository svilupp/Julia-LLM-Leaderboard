X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall useful Julia snippets for handling strings and regular expressions to identify sections.\n2. Write the function `q_and_a_extractor` to parse the input markdown text.\n3. Double-check the solution for correctness.\n\n### Step 1: Useful Julia Snippets\n\n- Use `split` and regular expressions to identify sections such as `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- Leverage functions to trim whitespace from the extracted strings.\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Function\n\nHere’s the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    capturing_question = false\n    capturing_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            capturing_question = true\n            capturing_answer = false\n            question = \"\"  # Reset question for new Q&A\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            capturing_answer = true\n            capturing_question = false\n            answer = \"\"  # Reset answer for new Q&A\n        elseif capturing_question && stripped_line != \"\"\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"  # Capture question text\n        elseif capturing_answer && stripped_line != \"\"\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"  # Capture answer text\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the final strings\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-checking the Solution\n\n- The function uses `strip` to remove extra whitespace around the question and answer.\n- It correctly identifies the start of questions and answers by checking for `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- It captures multiline questions and answers correctly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere’s how to use the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n(\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\")\n```\n\nThe implementation looks correct, and now it’s ready for use!","status":200,"tokens":[348,527],"elapsed":9.831876,"cost":0.00036839999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":503994794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
