Here's how you can implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Initialize empty lists to hold questions and answers\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    # Split the markdown text by lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize placeholders for current question and answer\n    current_question = \"\"\n    current_answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with # Question\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # If there's an existing question and answer stored, save them\n            if !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n                push!(questions, strip(current_question))\n                push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n            end\n            \n            # Reset current_question and start capturing the question\n            current_question = replace(line, r\"# Question\\s*\" => \"\")\n            current_answer = \"\"  # Reset current answer\n\n        # Check if the line starts with # Answer\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # If it's a new answer, store the previous question and answer if they exist\n            current_answer = replace(line, r\"# Answer\\s*\" => \"\")\n        else\n            # Append additional lines to the current question or answer\n            if !isempty(current_question)\n                current_answer *= \" \" * strip(line)\n            else\n                current_question *= \" \" * strip(line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last question and answer if they exist\n    if !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(current_answer)\n        push!(questions, strip(current_question))\n        push!(answers, strip(current_answer))\n    end\n\n    # Zip questions and answers into tuples\n    qa_pairs = [(q, a) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\n\n    return qa_pairs\nend\n\n# Example use\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\nThis is an additional line for the question.\n\n# Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question: What is the capital of Spain?\n# Answer: The capital of Spain is Madrid.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Signature**: The function `q_and_a_extractor` accepts a string formatted as markdown.\n2. **Splitting the String**: The markdown is split into separate lines for easier processing.\n3. **Looping through Lines**: Each line is checked to see if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n4. **Capturing Questions and Answers**:\n   - When a question line is found, it captures the current question and resets the answer.\n   - For answer lines, it captures the answer and concatenates any subsequent lines.\n5. **Finalizing Data**: After processing all lines, any remaining question and answer are added to the lists.\n6. **Creating Results**: The results are combined into a tuple format and returned.\n\n### Output:\nThe function returns a list of tuples containing `(question, answer)` pairs after processing the markdown-formatted input.","status":200,"tokens":[92,667],"elapsed":9.320545375,"cost":0.000414,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":276324986,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
