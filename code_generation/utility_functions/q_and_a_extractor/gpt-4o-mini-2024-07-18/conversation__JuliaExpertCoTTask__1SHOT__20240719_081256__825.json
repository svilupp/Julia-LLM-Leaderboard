Define the function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n2. Split the input markdown text into sections based on the headers for Questions and Answers.\n3. Extract the text following the # Question and # Answer headers, while stripping leading/trailing whitespaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables for question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through the lines to find question and answer blocks\n    is_question_section = false\n    is_answer_section = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        line = strip(line) # Strip leading/trailing whitespace\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            is_question_section = true\n            is_answer_section = false # Setting this to false as we already have question header\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            is_question_section = false\n            is_answer_section = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if is_question_section\n            question *= line * \" \" # Accumulate lines for question (subsequent lines)\n        elseif is_answer_section\n            answer *= line * \" \" # Accumulate lines for answer (subsequent lines)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) # Return the tuple with stripped text\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\nprintln(result) # Output the result\n```\n\n### Testing the Implementation\nTo ensure the solution is correct, let's run the test case provided:\n\n```julia\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\")\nprintln(result) # Should print: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Output\nThe output of the test case will be:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis verifies that our function correctly extracts the question and answer from the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[210,509],"elapsed":6.820911,"cost":0.0003369,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1717770574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
