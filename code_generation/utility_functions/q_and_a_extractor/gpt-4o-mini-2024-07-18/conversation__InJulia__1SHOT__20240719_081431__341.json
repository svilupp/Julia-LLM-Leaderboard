Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia that extracts questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the markdown text into lines.\n2. Iterate through the lines to find sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Capture the associated text for each question and answer and store them in a tuple after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            # Capture the question right after the header\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            # Capture the answer right after the header\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"  # Append the question line\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"  # Append the answer line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Final trimming of the question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Usage Example\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(q_and_a)  # Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis function ensures that the text extracted for both the question and the answer is clean and stripped of any excessive whitespace or newline characters. Make sure to handle cases where there might be multiple questions and answers by modifying the function accordingly if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[92,439],"elapsed":6.407595459,"cost":0.0002772,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1846117973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
