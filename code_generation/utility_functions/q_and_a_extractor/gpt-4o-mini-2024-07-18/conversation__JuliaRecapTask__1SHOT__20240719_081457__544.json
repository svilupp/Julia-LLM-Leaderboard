[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Identifies the sections marked with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Strips any leading spaces and newlines.\n3. Returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize variables for question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Split the markdown text into lines for easier processing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # State flags to identify when we are in the Question or Answer sections\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question_section = false\n            in_answer_section = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question_section && stripped_line != \"\"\n            question *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer_section && stripped_line != \"\"\n            answer *= stripped_line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip and finalize the question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n\n- The function starts by initializing `question` and `answer` to empty strings.\n- We read through each line in the markdown, checking for section headers that signal the start of the question or answer.\n- When we find a question or answer, we concatenate the relevant text while ensuring it is appended only when the section is active.\n- Finally, we apply `strip()` to ensure any extraneous whitespace is removed before returning a tuple.\n\nThis approach adheres to the typical markdown structure, ensuring compatibility with simple question and answer markdown formats.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nYou can test the function with a markdown string to see if it correctly extracts the question and answer:\n\n```julia\nmd_input = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_input)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe function is implemented correctly, and we have double-checked the logic and functionality. The solution meets the requirements provided in the task description.","status":200,"tokens":[348,641],"elapsed":7.021698334,"cost":0.0004368,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1189585855,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
