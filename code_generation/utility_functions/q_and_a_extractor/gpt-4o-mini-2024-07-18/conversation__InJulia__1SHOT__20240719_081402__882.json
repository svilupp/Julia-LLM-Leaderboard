The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown string `md` as input.\n2. Lines are split using newline characters.\n3. It processes each line, checking for headers (`# Question` and `# Answer`).\n4. It collects the subsequent lines as either the question or answer until it encounters another question header.\n5. The collected questions and answers are stripped of leading/trailing whitespace and stored in arrays.\n6. Finally, it returns a list of tuples containing pairs of questions and answers.\n\n### Example Output:\nWhen calling the function with the example markdown input, it would print:\n```\nQ: What is the capital of France?\nA: The capital of France is Paris.\nQ: What is the largest planet in our Solar System?\nA: The largest planet in our Solar System is Jupiter.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[92,719],"elapsed":9.420273709,"cost":0.0004452,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":250251162,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
