[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the problem of extracting Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text, I will follow the steps outlined earlier:\n\n1. **Recall useful Julia snippets**: We'll need to work with strings, potentially utilize regex for pattern matching, and have a way to manipulate the text to strip unwanted whitespace.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: We will create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that looks for the sections denoted by `# Question` and `# Answer`, and extracts the respective texts.\n\n3. **Double-check the solution**: Weâ€™ll ensure the function works by testing it with various markdown inputs.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize variables for question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize flags to determine if we are currently in a question or answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    # Iterate through each line\n    for line in lines\n        # Check for Question section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check for Answer section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the Question section, gather the text\n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n        \n        # If we are in the Answer section, gather the text\n        if in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return as tuple with stripped leading and trailing whitespace\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates over each line.\n- It checks for the presence of `# Question` and `# Answer` to toggle flags that keep track of whether we are currently gathering question text or answer text.\n- When it finds lines under the appropriate section, it concatenates the lines, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- Finally, it returns a tuple containing the cleaned question and answer.\n\n### Testing the Function\nWe should test the function on sample markdown inputs to ensure that it behaves as expected:\n\n```julia\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_example)\nprintln(result)  # Should print: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Double-checking the Solution\nWe ensure a variety of test cases to cover:\n- Normal question and answer sections.\n- Sections with leading/trailing whitespace.\n- Sections without either or both.\n\nWith the setup complete and the function implemented, the solution can now be verified with additional test cases as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[348,623],"elapsed":8.277420333,"cost":0.00042599999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1020021783,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
