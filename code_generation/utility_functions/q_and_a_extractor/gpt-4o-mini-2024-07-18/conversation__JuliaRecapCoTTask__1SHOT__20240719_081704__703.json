[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem of extracting questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Markdown Structure**: We need to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. **Extract Necessary Text**: We will capture the text following these headers and strip any leading spaces or newlines.\n3. **Return as a Tuple**: We will return the extracted question and answer in the required tuple format.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's how we can implement the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize variables to hold question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate through each line to find the Question and Answer sections\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        line = lines[i]\n        # Check for Question section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Extract question by taking the next line\n            if i + 1 <= length(lines)\n                question = strip(lines[i + 1])  # strip leading/trailing whitespace\n            end\n        end\n        \n        # Check for Answer section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Extract answer by taking the next line\n            if i + 1 <= length(lines)\n                answer = strip(lines[i + 1])  # strip leading/trailing whitespace\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `split(md, \"\\n\")` function splits the markdown text into individual lines.\n- We loop through each line to check if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n- If we find a line that starts with one of these headers, we take the next line as the content (the question or answer). We use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing white spaces.\n- Finally, we return a tuple containing the cleaned question and answer.\n\n### Double-checking\n\n- We ensure that the indices do not go out of bounds when checking for the next line.\n- We have considered leading/trailing whitespace.\n- This function handles markdown text expected in the specified format.\n\nThis should work effectively for extracting the desired information from markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[349,503],"elapsed":10.27618675,"cost":0.00035414999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1930693064,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
