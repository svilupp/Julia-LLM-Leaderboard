The stripped line is then saved into the appropriate variable.\n- The function continues to concatenate text until it encounters the next header.\n- Finally, if there's any remaining question and answer text, they are added to the lists before returning a list of tuples containing all question-answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[92,710],"elapsed":8.215913292,"cost":0.0004398,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-831605211,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
