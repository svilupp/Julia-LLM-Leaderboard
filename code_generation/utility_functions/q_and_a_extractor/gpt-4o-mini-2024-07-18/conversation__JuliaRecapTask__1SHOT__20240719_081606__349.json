[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Regular expressions can also be useful for identifying markdown headings.\n\n2. **Define the function**: We'll create the function `q_and_a_extractor` which will take a string as input and output a tuple of the question and answer.\n\n3. **Implement the logic**: \n   - Split the input markdown text into lines.\n   - Look for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   - Extract the text that follows the headings and properly format it.\n\n4. **Return the result**: Finally, return the extracted question and answer stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nLet's implement this in code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Temporary variable to identify if we are in Question or Answer sections.\n    current_section = nothing\n    \n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        # Check for the Question section\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = :question\n            # Extract the question text, remove the heading\n            question = strip(replace(stripped_line, r\"# Question\\s*\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :answer\n            # Extract the answer text, remove the heading\n            answer = strip(replace(stripped_line, r\"# Answer\\s*\" => \"\"))\n        elseif current_section == :question && !isempty(stripped_line)\n            # Append to question if we are in this section\n            question *= \" \" * stripped_line\n        elseif current_section == :answer && !isempty(stripped_line)\n            # Append to answer if we are in this section\n            answer *= \" \" * stripped_line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n- We use `split` to break the markdown text into lines.\n- We then loop through each line and check if it starts a new section. We also accumulate text until we switch sections.\n- The `replace` function allows us to remove the heading and extract just the text needed.\n- Finally, we return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\n### Double-checking:\n- Ensure proper handling of leading/trailing whitespace.\n- Check if the solution handles cases where there are multiple lines for questions/answers properly.\n- Test with various markdown formats to verify robustness.\n\nThis function should provide the desired extraction of questions and answers from the markdown text effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[348,578],"elapsed":9.4990545,"cost":0.00039899999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1923438898,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
