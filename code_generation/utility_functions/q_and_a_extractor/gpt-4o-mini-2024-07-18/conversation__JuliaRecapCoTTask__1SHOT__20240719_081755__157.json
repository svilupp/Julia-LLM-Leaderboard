X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The function will:\n1. Split the markdown text into lines.\n2. Identify the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the relevant content, clean it up, and return it as a tuple.\n\nHere's how the implementation looks:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n        \n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false\n            question = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer_section = true\n            in_question_section = false\n            answer = \"\"\n        elseif in_question_section\n            question *= stripped_line * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer_section\n            answer *= stripped_line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n- The function correctly initializes flags for tracking whether we are in a question or answer section.\n- We use `strip` to clean up the lines as we concatenate the sections.\n- Finally, the function returns the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThis implementation should work effectively for well-formatted markdown content with appropriate headers. \n\n### Example Usage\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n    What is the capital of France?\n    \n# Answer\n    Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output should be: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")\n```\n\nIf further refinement or additional features are required, please let me know!","status":200,"tokens":[349,481],"elapsed":6.851284625,"cost":0.00034094999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1581776242,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
