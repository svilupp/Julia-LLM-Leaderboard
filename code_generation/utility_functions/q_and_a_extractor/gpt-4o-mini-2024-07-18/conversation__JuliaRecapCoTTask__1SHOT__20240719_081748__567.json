[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia Snippets\nFor this task, we will mainly leverage:\n- Regular expressions to find the sections of interest.\n- String manipulation functions to trim whitespace and format the output.\n\n### 2. Solve the Task\nHere is how I would implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize question and answer variables\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Split the text into lines for easier processing\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check for Question section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question_section = false\n            in_answer_section = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Collect the question text\n        if in_question_section\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        # Collect the answer text\n        elseif in_answer_section\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace/newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Double-Check the Solution\nI'll run through a few test cases to ensure that the function works correctly.\n\n```julia\n# Test case 1: Simple question and answer\nmd_text_1 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test case 2: Question without answer\nmd_text_2 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the largest planet in the Solar System?\n\n# Answer\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test case 3: Answer without question\nmd_text_3 = \"\"\"\n# Answer\nThis part has no question.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Test case 4: Incorrect format\nmd_text_4 = \"\"\"\nSome random text without the expected format.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text_1))  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text_2))  # Expected: (\"What is the largest planet in the Solar System?\", \"\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text_3))  # Expected: (\"\", \"This part has no question.\")\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text_4))  # Expected: (\"\", \"\")\n```\n\n### Summary\nThe implementation should handle cases where there are missing questions or answers, and will work robustly with trivial markdown formatting errors. The returned tuple will contain trimmed versions of the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[349,610],"elapsed":12.578316042,"cost":0.00041835,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-799915032,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
