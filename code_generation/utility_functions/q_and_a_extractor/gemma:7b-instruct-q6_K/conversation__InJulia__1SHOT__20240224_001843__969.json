It will not extract text from sections that use different headings.\n* It also assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted, with clear section headings and no formatting errors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":26.311010417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":18904,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
