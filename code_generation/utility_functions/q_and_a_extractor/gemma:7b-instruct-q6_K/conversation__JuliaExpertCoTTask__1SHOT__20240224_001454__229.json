So, the approach will involve splitting the text into sections, stripping leading spaces and newlines, and extracting the text after \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n2. **Write any functions and other code:** The function `q_and_a_extractor` is defined to extract the question and answer.\n3. **Solve the task:** The function takes a markdown text `md` as input and returns a tuple `(question, answer)` containing the extracted question and answer.\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:** The code is tested with the provided data, and the output is verified to ensure it matches the expected result.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n\n# Output:\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This code assumes that the markdown text has the format shown in the data section.\n* It does not handle nested markdown sections or other complex markdown formatting.\n* The code can be modified to extract text from different sections or formats.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":24.832030667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":13187,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
