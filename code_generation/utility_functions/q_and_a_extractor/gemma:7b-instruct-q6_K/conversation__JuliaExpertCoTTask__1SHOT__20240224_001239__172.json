You need to split the text into sections based on the # markers and then extract the text after the # Question and # Answer sections.\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:** You need a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown string as input and returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n3. **Solve the task:** Use the `split` function to split the text into sections based on the # markers. Extract the section after the # Question and # Answer sections and strip any leading spaces and newlines.\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:** Pass the sample data to the function and verify that the extracted question and answer are correct.\n\n**Sample Usage:**\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n\n# Output:\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":22.228179333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-30122,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
