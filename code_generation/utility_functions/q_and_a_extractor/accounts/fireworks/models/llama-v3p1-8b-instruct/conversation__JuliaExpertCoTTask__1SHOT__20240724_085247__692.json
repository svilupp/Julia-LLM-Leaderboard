Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes markdown text `md` as an argument.\n\n2. Use a loop to find the occurrence of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the markdown text.\n\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n4.

This code defines a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer from the markdown text and returns them as a tuple. The code then tests the function with an example markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[211,405],"elapsed":1.533897667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":261557780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
