[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

If the markdown text is malformed (i.e., the question or answer text is missing), it throws an error. \n\nTo use this function, you would call it with the markdown text like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question What is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer ... \n42\n\"\"\"\n\nqna = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(qna)  # Output: (\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[351,331],"elapsed":1.228401083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1822677572,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
