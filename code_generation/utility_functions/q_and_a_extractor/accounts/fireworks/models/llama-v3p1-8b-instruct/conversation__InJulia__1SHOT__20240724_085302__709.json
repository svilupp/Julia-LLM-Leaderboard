If it finds a match, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the section and stores it in the corresponding variable. If both question and answer are found, it breaks the loop and returns the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[94,361],"elapsed":1.257426583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":887865109,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
