X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

You should have a clear problem statement with the relevant details. You should be able to identify the Julia language features that will be used to solve the Task. You should write a clear solution in Julia code. You should run the code and test it against a variety of inputs. You should double-check your solution for correctness.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))\n```\n\nThis solution uses a Markdown parser to extract the question and answer from the given markdown text. The `q_and_a_extractor` function splits the markdown text into lines and goes through each line to check if it matches the starting patterns `# Question` or `# Answer`. When it encounters these patterns, it pushes the last encountered text into the corresponding arrays for questions or answers.","status":200,"tokens":[352,508],"elapsed":1.751764333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-32244705,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
