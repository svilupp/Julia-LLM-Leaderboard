It first checks if the line starts with \"# Question \" and, if so, extracts the text that follows. Then, it iterates through the following lines to find a line that starts with \"# Answer \". When it finds this line, it extracts the text that follows and adds both the question and the answer to their respective arrays. The function finally returns a tuple containing these arrays.\n\nWhen you run this function with the provided example markdown text, it will extract the questions and answers, strip the leading spaces and newlines, and print them out in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[94,510],"elapsed":1.809240834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1148157605,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
