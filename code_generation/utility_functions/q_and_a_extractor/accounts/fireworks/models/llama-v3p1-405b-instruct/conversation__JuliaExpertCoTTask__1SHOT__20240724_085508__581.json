We need to identify these sections in the markdown text, extract the relevant text, and then strip leading spaces and newlines.\n\n## Step 2: Write a function to identify the question and answer sections\nWe will create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes the markdown text `md` as input and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    is_question = false\n    is_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            is_question = true\n            is_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            is_question = false\n            is_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if is_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif is_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Test the function with the provided data\nWe will test the `q_and_a_extractor` function with the provided markdown text to ensure it correctly extracts the question and answer.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\n## Step 4: Verify the solution\nThe output of the `q_and_a_extractor` function should match the expected tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n```julia\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[211,409],"elapsed":13.8578815,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2108076271,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
