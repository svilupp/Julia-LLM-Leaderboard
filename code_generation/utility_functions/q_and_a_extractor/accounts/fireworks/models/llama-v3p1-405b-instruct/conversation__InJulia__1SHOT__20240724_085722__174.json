[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function to accomplish this task. It uses regular expressions to find the sections of the markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*\\n*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#\\s*(?:Answer|Question)|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*\\n*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=#\\s*(?:Answer|Question)|$)\"\n    question = replace(strip(match(question_pattern, md)[1]), \"\\n  \"=>\" \")\n    answer = replace(strip(match(answer_pattern, md)[1]), \"\\n  \"=>\" \")\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHowever, using a Markdown parser could be a more efficient solution for large or complex markdown files. The simple example above doesn't account for some edge cases, such as text between the answer and next question sections.\n\nIn case you have a complex markdown structure or need more edge checks, the following solution would work better for you. This uses `regex` and allows for multiple Q&A sections.\n\n```julia\nimport Regex\n\nmutable struct extraction\n    question\n    answer\nend\n\nfunction extractqna!(r::extraction, m)\n    (r.question == nothing) ? r.question = m.captures[1] : r.answer = m.captures[1]\n    nothing\nend\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    qna = [extraction(nothing, nothing)]\n    forEachMatch(r\"#\\s*(Question|Answer)\\s*\\n*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=(?:#\\s*(?:Answer|Question))|$)\", \n        md; \n        callInLoop=extractqna!, callAfterLoop=r -> map(x -> replace(strip(x), \"\\n  \"=>\" \"), [r.question r.answer]))\n    return Tuple.(Tuple.(qna[1:end-1]))\nend\n\nforEachMatch(r::Regex, s::String; callInLoop::Function, callAfterLoop::Function) = \n    let i = 1, s1=match(r, s)\n        captured=Vector()\n        while s1!==nothing\n            callInLoop(s1)\n            push!(captured, s1)\n            s1 = match_next(r, s1, i)\n            if s1 !== nothing; i = s1.offset + s1.match_offset; end\n        end\n        s1 = captured[end]\n        captured[end] = callAfterLoop(captured)\n        callAfterLoop.(captured)\n    end\n```\n\nThe code can be executed using, for example:\n```julia\nmd=\"\"\"\n    # Question\n    What is a machine learning model?\n    # Answer\n    A statistical framework aimed at minimizing the difference between the predicted values (that of the training data and that of what the model predicts for the learning data).\n    \"\"\"\n\nans=q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(ans)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[94,612],"elapsed":21.73713725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2134081213,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
