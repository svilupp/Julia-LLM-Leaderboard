When one of these flags is turned on, we start copying the contents of the parsed lines to `question` and `answer`, respectively. We use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line. Finally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,315],"elapsed":11.786751166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1604081663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
