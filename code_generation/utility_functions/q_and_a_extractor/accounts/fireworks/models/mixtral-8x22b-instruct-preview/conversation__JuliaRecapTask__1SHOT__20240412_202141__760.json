[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

There are existing packages like Markdown.jl, but for simplicity and efficiency, I will use regular expressions.\n\nRecalling Julia's syntax and capabilities:\n- We have the `match` function from Base to apply regular expressions on strings.\n- String manipulation like `strip` and `split` could be useful.\n- We can use anonymous functions together with other higher-order functions like `collect` and `map`.\n\n## Solution\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function that utilizes the aforementioned functions and techniques:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # We convert the markdown string into an array by splitting on \"\\n\".\n    md_","status":200,"tokens":[411,200],"elapsed":3.515609416,"cost":0.0005499,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1122258146,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
