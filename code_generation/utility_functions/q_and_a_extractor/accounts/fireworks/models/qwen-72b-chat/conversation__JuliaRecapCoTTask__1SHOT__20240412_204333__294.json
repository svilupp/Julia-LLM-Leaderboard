[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your instructions, I suggest we parse the markdown text line by line and extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. Here's how I will proceed:\n\n1. Create a function `q_and_a_extractor` which takes an input `md` of type `AbstractString`\n2. Initialize empty strings for the `question` and `answer`\n3. Split the markdown input by newlines `\"\\n\"`\n4. Loop through the lines of the input and store the question and answer text\n   a. If the line starts with `# Question`, set the question variable to be the remainder of the line\n   b. If the line starts with `# Answer`, set the answer variable to be the remainder of the line\n5. Return a tuple of the question and answer strings\n\nThis approach should handle most markdown inputs with the specified format. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n```julia\n# Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for","status":200,"tokens":[352,200],"elapsed":3.829321917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":673526111,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
