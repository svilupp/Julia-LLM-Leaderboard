[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then, we can use this helper function to iterate through the lines of the markdown text, and extract the question and answer sections by keeping track of the state of whether we are currently in a question or answer section. For each section, we concatenate the lines of text until we encounter the next header. Finally, we concatenate the strings for each section, remove leading spaces and newlines, and return the result as a tuple.\n\nLet's apply these steps and implement the function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    is_header(line) =startswith(line, \"#\")\n    state = nothing\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if state == nothing && is_header(line) && occursin(r\"Question$\", line)\n            state","status":200,"tokens":[351,200],"elapsed":3.923520708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1845453640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
