[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

I can use regular expressions to match the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text. I can also use string methods like `strip` to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Once I have the question and answer, I can return them as a tuple.\n\nNext, I will implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function. The function will take a markdown-formatted text `md` as input. It will use a regular expression to match all Question and Answer sections in the text. For each match, it will extract the question and answer using string methods, and append them to an array of tuples. Finally, it will return the array of tuples containing the matched question-answer pairs.\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Vector{(AbstractString,AbstractString)}\n    pattern = r\"# Question (.*)\\n\\n(.*)\\n\\n#","status":200,"tokens":[352,200],"elapsed":3.912958333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1042532554,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
