Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The function will return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding question and answer.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n\nWhat","status":200,"tokens":[128,200],"elapsed":3.390711208,"cost":0.0005248,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-814580464,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
