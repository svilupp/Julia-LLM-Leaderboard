It splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over the lines to extract the question and answer text. The extracted text is then stripped of any leading or trailing spaces and newlines and returned as a tuple. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `q_and_a_extractor` function to extract question and answer text from a markdown-formatted string.","status":200,"tokens":[94,460],"elapsed":3.973604125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1493125262,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
