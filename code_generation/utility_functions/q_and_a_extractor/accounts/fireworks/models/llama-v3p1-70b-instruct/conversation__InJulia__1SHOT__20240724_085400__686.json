The `question_pattern` and `answer_pattern` are regular expressions that match the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" sections, respectively. The `eachmatch` function is used to find all occurrences of these patterns in the text. The extracted text is then stripped of leading and trailing spaces and newlines using the `strip` function. Finally, the extracted Questions and Answers are returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[94,398],"elapsed":3.760762916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1307912045,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
