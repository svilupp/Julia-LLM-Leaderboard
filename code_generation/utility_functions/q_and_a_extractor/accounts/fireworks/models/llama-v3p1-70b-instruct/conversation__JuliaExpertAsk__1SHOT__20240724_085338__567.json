Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can achieve this:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Define the regex pattern to extract question and answer sections\n    pattern = r\"# Question(.*?)# Answer(.*?)#?|\\Z\"gs\n    \n    # Use the regex pattern to find matches in the markdown text\n    matches = match(pattern, md, overlap = true)\n    \n    # If matches are found\n    if matches != nothing\n        # Extract the question and answer text\n        question = strip(match(matches[1], r\"[^\\n]+(?:\\n.*)*\"))\n        answer = strip(match(matches[2], r\"[^\\n]+(?:\\n.*)*\"))\n        \n        # Return the extracted text as a tuple\n        return question, answer\n    end\n\n    # If no matches are found\n    return nothing\nend\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```julia\n# Markdown text with a question and an answer section\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is an answer.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function to extract the question and answer\nextracted = q_and_a_extractor(markdown_text)\n\n# Display the extracted text\nif extracted !== nothing\n    println(\"Question: \", extracted[1])\n    println(\"Answer: \", extracted[2])\nelse\n    println(\"No question or answer section found in the markdown text.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by defining a regex pattern that matches the markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then using the `match` function to find matches in the provided markdown text. After finding the matches, the function extracts the question and answer text, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the extracted text as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[129,362],"elapsed":2.913145833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-989970179,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
