It then extracts the question and answer text from the sections that contain the respective headers, skipping any blank lines. The question and answer are returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[211,377],"elapsed":3.530368167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1027090443,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
