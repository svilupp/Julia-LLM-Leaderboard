It then extracts the question and answer text from each section, strips any leading spaces or newlines, and returns a list of tuples containing the extracted text. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function and print the extracted question and answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[94,350],"elapsed":2.951337625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2030963850,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
