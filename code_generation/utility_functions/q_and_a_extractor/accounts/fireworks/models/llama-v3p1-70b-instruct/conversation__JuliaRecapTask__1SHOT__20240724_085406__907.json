[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We split the markdown text into sections based on the headers (`\\n# `).\n2. We iterate through the sections and check if each section contains the `# Question` or `# Answer` header. If it does, we extract the text following the header.\n3. We use `lstrip` to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. We use `replace` to remove the header text from the extracted text.\n5. We return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nExample use case:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\nThe answer is not easy to find.\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(question)  # Output: \"What is the meaning of life?\\nThe answer is not easy to find.\"\nprintln(answer)  # Output: \"42\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[351,386],"elapsed":3.098459667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-687383308,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
