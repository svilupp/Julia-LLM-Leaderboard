When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the sections:** We'll look for the substrings `# Question` and `# Answer` to locate the beginning of the relevant sections.\n2. **Extract the text:** Extract the text between these markers. We'll carefully slice the original string based on the positions of these markers.\n3. **Strip unnecessary whitespace:** Ensure that leading and trailing spaces and newlines are stripped from the extracted sections.\n4. **Return the results as a tuple:** Finally, return the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the start positions of Question and Answer sections\n    q_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    a_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the text by slicing the string appropriately\n    question = strip(md[q_start + length(\"# Question\"):a_start - 1])\n    answer = strip(md[a_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Solve the Task:\n\nLet's test the function using the provided data.\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Check the Solution:\n\nThe function should correctly extract and return the question and answer in the required format.","status":200,"tokens":[210,329],"elapsed":3.750100666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":715361350,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
