[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Understand the Task\nWe need to extract text from the given markdown string between the headers `# Question` and `# Answer`. Then package the texts into a tuple and return.\n\n### Step 2: Approach\n1. Split the input string `md` around the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.\n2. Extract the text between these headers.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text.\n4. Return the results as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Step 3: Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split based on headers\n    parts = split(md, r\"# *(Question|Answer)\")\n    \n    # Extract and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    question = strip(parts[2])\n    answer = strip(parts[3])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Task\n\nLet's apply the function to the given data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n# Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis solution correctly extracts and returns the expected tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[210,276],"elapsed":3.377331458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":287163575,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
