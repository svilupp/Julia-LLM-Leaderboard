[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task:\n\n### Task Breakdown\n1. We need to extract the text from specific markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. We will return the question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n3. The text should be stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\n### Steps:\n- We need to locate the positions of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the input string.\n- Extract the text after these markers until the next section header or the end of the text.\n- Clean up the extracted text by removing any leading/trailing spaces or newlines.\n- Return the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- String manipulation and regular expression matching: `occursin()`, `findfirst()`, `strip()`\n- String slicing: `string[start:end]`\n- Tuple creation: `(val1, val2)`\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find the start of the # Question section\n    question_start = findfirst(r\"# Question\", md)\n    if question_start === nothing\n        error(\"No # Question section found\")\n    end\n    \n    # Find the start of the # Answer section\n    answer_start = findfirst(r\"# Answer\", md)\n    if answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"No # Answer section found\")\n    end\n    \n    # Compute the positions immediately after the headers\n    q_text_start = question_start + length(\"# Question\")\n    a_text_start = answer_start + length(\"# Answer\")\n    \n    # Find where the question ends (either at the start of the answer or at the end of the string)\n    q_text_end = answer_start - 1\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer\n    question = strip(md[q_text_start:q_text_end])\n    answer = strip(md[a_text_start:end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check the solution:\n- **Edge Case (Only spaces or newlines between headers):** \n  The approach takes care of stripping leading/trailing spaces or newlines.\n- **Ensure section headers are properly identified and extracted:**\n  We handle cases where `# Question` or `# Answer` don't exist with an appropriate error message.\n  \nThis code should correctly handle the typical markdown format you're working with.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\n\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Should return (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")\n```\n\n### Additional Consideration:\nIf you want to handle cases where multiple `# Question` or `# Answer` sections exist, then the function may need to be extended. The current solution assumes one question and one answer per input string.","status":200,"tokens":[349,589],"elapsed":7.179422459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1850941156,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
