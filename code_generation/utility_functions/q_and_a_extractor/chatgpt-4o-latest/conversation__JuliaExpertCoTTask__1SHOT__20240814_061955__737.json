[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Understand the Task\nWe need to extract the contents of the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from markdown text `md`. The text starts with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and we need to return the trimmed content from these sections as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n## Step 2: Plan the Approach\n1. Locate the position of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the input string `md`.\n2. Extract the text that appears under the `# Question` header until the next header (`# Answer`).\n3. Similarly, extract the text that appears under the `# Answer` header until the end of the string or the next header (if any).\n4. Strip any leading and trailing spaces or newlines from the extracted question and answer.\n\n## Step 3: Write the Function\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the position of the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Extract and clean the question part\n    question = strip(md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start-1])\n    \n    # Extract and clean the answer part\n    answer = strip(md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 4: Test the Function\nWe can test with the provided input example.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n## Step 5: Verify the Solution\n\n- The function seems correct.\n- The tuple has both parts, the question and the answer, correctly trimmed and extracted.\n\nThis approach should work well for the provided input and similar markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[210,422],"elapsed":4.80348725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-867544030,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
