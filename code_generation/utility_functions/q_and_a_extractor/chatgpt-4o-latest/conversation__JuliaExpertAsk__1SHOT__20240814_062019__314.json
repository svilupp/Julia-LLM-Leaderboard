[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=# Answer)\"s\n    answer = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*)\"s\n    \n    q_match = match(question, md)\n    a_match = match(answer, md)\n    \n    if q_match !== nothing && a_match !== nothing\n        q_text = strip(q_match.captures[1])\n        a_text = strip(a_match.captures[1])\n        return (q_text, a_text)\n    else\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It uses regular expressions to extract text following `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. The `s` modifier allows `.` to match newline characters.\n3. After matching, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the captured groups.\n4. Returns a tuple of `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can use this function as shown below:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))\n```\n\nThis will return:\n```julia\n(\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[125,278],"elapsed":3.31787575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1796559326,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
