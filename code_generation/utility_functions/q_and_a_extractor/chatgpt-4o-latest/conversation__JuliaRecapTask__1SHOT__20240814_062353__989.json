[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's start by breaking down the task.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. The input is a string `md` in Markdown format.\n2. We need to find sections in the markdown that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. We have to extract the text following `# Question` until the next section `# Answer`.\n4. Similarly, extract text following `# Answer` until the next header or end of the text.\n5. Both the question and answer should have leading and trailing whitespace removed.\n6. The function should return these as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- Finding a substring in a string can be done using `findfirst` or regular expressions.\n- Substrings extraction can be achieved using string slicing.\n- Using `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces or newlines.\n- Tuple creation is straightforward, `(element1, element2)`.\n\n### Solution Implementation:\n\nWe'll begin by identifying the positions of the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. Then, we'll extract the text between these headers, apply appropriate trimming, and return the result as a tuple.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Finding positions\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Either Question or Answer section not found.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the question part\n    question_text = strip(md[(question_start + length(\"# Question\")) : (answer_start - 1)])\n\n    # Extract the answer part\n    answer_text = strip(md[(answer_start + length(\"# Answer\")) : end])\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `findfirst(\"# Question\", md)` finds the first occurrence of `# Question` in `md`.\n- `strip(md[start_idx:end_idx])` removes any leading and trailing spaces or newlines from the substring.\n- We use slicing (`start_idx:end_idx`) to extract relevant sections of the text.\n- We return the question and answer as a tuple `(question_text, answer_text)`.\n\n### Double-check:\nLet's consider some edge cases:\n- The text starting directly after `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n- Potential multiline text in either section.\n- Ensuring no content is missed due to off-by-one errors.\n\n### Example Test:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\nThis is an intro.\n\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text) \n# Expected output: (\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\")\n```\n\n### Final Function:\n\nThis implementation should be efficient and handle typical markdown text scenarios.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Finding positions\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Either Question or Answer section not found.\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract the question part\n    question_text = strip(md[(question_start + length(\"# Question\")) : (answer_start - 1)])\n\n    # Extract the answer part\n    answer_text = strip(md[(answer_start + length(\"# Answer\")) : end])\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis should capably extract the desired sections and fit the problem requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[348,738],"elapsed":8.685666375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":182400627,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
