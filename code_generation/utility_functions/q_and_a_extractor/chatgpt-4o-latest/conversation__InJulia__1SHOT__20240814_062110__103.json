Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia. This function will take in a markdown-formatted text `md`, extract the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections, and then return the results as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    inside_question = false\n    inside_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inside_question = true\n            inside_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inside_answer = true\n            inside_question = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# \") # Any other heading, we stop collecting\n            inside_question = false\n            inside_answer = false\n        end\n        \n        if inside_question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif inside_answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading/trailing whitespaces and new lines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introductory section that is not part of Q&A.\n    \n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Note\nThis section should not be included in the results.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Splitting into lines:** The markdown document is split into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n- **Flags `inside_question` and `inside_answer`:** These flags keep track of whether we're currently inside the `# Question` or `# Answer` sections.\n- **Appending content:** If the current line belongs to the `# Question` or `# Answer` section, its contents are appended to the respective variable.\n- **Stopping the capture:** When any other header (i.e., a line starting with `# `) is encountered, the flags are turned off to stop capturing content.\n- **Stripping whitespace:** Before returning the result, leading and trailing spaces or newlines from both the question and the answer are stripped.\n\nThe function will correctly extract the portions of the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings, returning them as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[92,544],"elapsed":7.892361125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1678745264,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
