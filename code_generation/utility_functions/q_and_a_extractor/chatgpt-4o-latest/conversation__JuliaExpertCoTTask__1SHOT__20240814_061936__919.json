Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. Parse the input string to locate the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers.\n2. Extract the text following each of the headers.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing whitespace/newlines from the question and answer.\n4. Return both the question and answer as a tuple.\n\n## Implementation\n\nLet's implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Identify the start of the Question and Answer sections\n    q_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    a_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer texts\n    question = strip(md[q_start + length(\"# Question\"):a_start-1])\n    answer = strip(md[a_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n## Example Execution\n\nLet's test the function with the given data.\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Should output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- `findfirst(\"# Question\", md)` locates where `# Question` starts.\n- `findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)` locates where `# Answer` starts.\n- `strip()` is used to remove any excess whitespace/newlines around the extracted text.\n\nThis code will extract the question and answer correctly from the markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[210,339],"elapsed":4.345545375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":437427099,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
