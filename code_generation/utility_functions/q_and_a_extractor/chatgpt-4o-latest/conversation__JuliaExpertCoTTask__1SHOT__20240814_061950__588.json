When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to extract texts in sections specifically marked by `# Question` and `# Answer` from a given markdown string. We'll return the texts following these sections as a tuple.\n\n### Step 2: Plan the Approach\n1. First, identify the start of the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections using string methods like `split`.\n2. Extract the text following each of these headings.\n3. Ensure that the extracted text is properly stripped of leading/trailing whitespace or newlines.\n4. Return the extracted `question` and `answer` as a tuple.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Function\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold extracted question and answer\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    question_flag, answer_flag = false, false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        line = strip(line)  # Remove leading/trailing spaces\n        \n        if line == \"# Question\"\n            question_flag = true\n            answer_flag = false\n            continue\n        elseif line == \"# Answer\"\n            question_flag = false\n            answer_flag = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if question_flag\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif answer_flag\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip the last newlines if they exist\n    question = chomp(question)\n    answer = chomp(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Test the Function\n\nTest it on the provided markdown example.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n### Check the Solution\n- The function should correctly identify and separate the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n- It should handle multiple lines well, within the respective sections.\n- It should correctly strip any excess whitespace.\n\nThus, the function is expected to return `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")` for this example.","status":200,"tokens":[210,486],"elapsed":5.6631815,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1628607794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
