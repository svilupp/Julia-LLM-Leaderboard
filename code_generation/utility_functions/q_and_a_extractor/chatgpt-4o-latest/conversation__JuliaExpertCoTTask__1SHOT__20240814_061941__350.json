When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Analyze the Problem\nThe markdown text has two distinct sections, \"Question\" and \"Answer\". We need to extract text between these headers and return them as a tuple `(question, answer)`. We should also strip any leading or trailing spaces and newlines.\n\n## Step 2: Approach\n1. Split the input string into individual lines.\n2. Identify the sections using markers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Collect the text following these markers until another section marker is encountered or until the end of the input.\n4. Clean up text by stripping leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n5. Return a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\n## Step 3: Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Determine the current section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        else\n            if current_section == \"question\"\n                question *= line * \"\\n\"\n            elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n                answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Post-process: strip extraneous whitespace\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 4: Testing the Function\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\n## Step 5: Validate the Solution\nEnsure that the function correctly extracts and sanitizes the text, even if the input contains additional newlines or spaces between sections, or at the start/end of each section.\n\nYou can test this with various markdown strings to confirm correct behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[210,433],"elapsed":4.872140084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1803532402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
