[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Problem Solving\n\nTo solve the task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Breakdown of Markdown Structure\nThe markdown text `md` may have sections titled \"Question\" and \"Answer\" under headers starting with `#` (level 1 header). Examples:\n\n```markdown\n# Some Section\nContent for some section.\n\n# Question\nThis is a question?\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer.\n```\n\n### Step 2: Regex for Extracting Sections\nWe'll use regular expressions to find and extract text under these sections. We can utilize the `r\"(?sm)#\\s*HeaderName\\W(.*?)\\n#\\s*(\\w+)\"` pattern where `HeaderName` is `Question` or `Answer`, and `(.*?)` is for non-greedy matching of everything until the next header.\n\n### Step 3: Return the Extracted Values\nThe content under `# Question` and `# Answer` will be stored in variables `question` and `answer`. Both should be stripped of leading/trailing spaces or newlines.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Output\nFinally, the function will return a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Step 5: Validation\nDouble-check by testing the function with different markdown structures to ensure it correctly handles various possible formats.\n\n## Solution Implementation in Julia\n\nHere's the function that follows the plan:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\s+(.*?)\\s*(?=$|#)\", md, s=RegexFlags.MULTILINE)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\s+(.*?)\\s*(?=$|#)\", md, s=RegexFlags.MULTILINE)\n    \n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regex for Question Section**: `r\"# Question\\s+(.*?)\\s*(?=$|#)\"`:\n  - `# Question\\s+`: Matches \"Question\" section header followed by space(s).\n  - `(.*?)`: Captures all text up to the next header (non-greedy).\n  - `\\s*`: Matches whitespace.\n  - `(?=$|#)`: Ensures the capture continues until either the end of the string or the next header.\n\n- **Same Regex Logic Applied for Answer Section**: `r\"# Answer\\s+(.*?)\\s*(?=$|#)\"`.\n\n- **Output**: The function returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. If any section is missing, an empty string `\"\"` will be returned in its place.\n\n### Step 6: Testing\nTesting on various markdown examples to confirm correctness.\n\n```julia\n# Example 1: Both sections present\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some Section\nIntro content.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Expected Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n\n\n# Example 2: Missing Answer section\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat's the square root of 4?\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Expected Output: (\"What's the square root of 4?\", \"\")\n```\n\nThis function should perform correctly across the test cases!","status":200,"tokens":[349,722],"elapsed":7.571374667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1648290121,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
