[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\n1. **String Operations:**\n   - `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace and newlines.\n   - `findnext()` to search for the next occurrence of a substring.\n   - `findlast()` to search for the last occurrence of a substring.\n   - Substring extraction using `s[start_index:end_index]`.\n\n2. **Regex and String Splitting:**\n   - `r\"\\n# \"` to match section headers.\n   - `findall()` to locate all sections that start with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n   - Splitting strings at specific locations with indexing.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to extract the text between the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from the markdown. For this, we will look for the indices in the string where these sections start and end.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. Identify where the \"Question\" section starts (`# Question`).\n2. Identify where the \"Answer\" section starts (`# Answer`).\n3. Extract the text between these headers.\n4. Strip leading and trailing whitespaces and newlines for cleanliness.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString,AbstractString}\n    # Find the locations of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers\n    question_start = findnext(r\"# Question\\b\", md)\n    answer_start = findnext(r\"# Answer\\b\", md)\n    \n    # Assume that both headers exist in the markdown\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        error(\"Markdown is missing 'Question' or 'Answer' section.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Define the region to extract the question & answer text\n    question_text = strip(md[(question_start+length(\"# Question\")): (answer_start-1)])\n    # The answer ends either at the end of the text or at the next markdown section.\n    answer_text = strip(md[(answer_start+length(\"# Answer\")):end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`findnext(r\"# Question\\b\", md)`**: Detects the start of the \"Question\" section.\n2. **`findnext(r\"# Answer\\b\", md)`**: Detects the start of the \"Answer\" section.\n3. Using these two indices, extract the relevant text between them. \n    - `strip()` is used to clean up the text.\n4. The function returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\n## Step 3: Double-check\n\nLet's ensure the function works logically:\n\n1. **Presence of both headers:** The function checks whether the headers exist in the markdown.\n2. **Text between headers:** Extracts the text and houses them in a tuple after appropriate stripping of spaces or newlines.\n3. **Edge Case:** If no \"Answer\" or \"Question\" exists, it will throw an error.\n\nOverall, this Julia function should correctly solve the task by extracting the relevant Q&A sections.","status":200,"tokens":[348,629],"elapsed":8.157976041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-241414864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
