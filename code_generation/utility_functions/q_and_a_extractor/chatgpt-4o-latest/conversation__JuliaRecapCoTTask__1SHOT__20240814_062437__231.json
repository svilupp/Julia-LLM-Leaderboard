[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task, we need to extract sections from markdown text. We should first search for sections labeled with `# Question` and `# Answer`, then capture the corresponding content, strip leading spaces and newlines, and finally return them in a tuple.\n\nLet's break down the solution into straightforward steps:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify where the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections start and end.**\n2. **Extract the text between these markers while handling the possibility of other sections or unexpected end-of-input scenarios.**\n3. **Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted content.**\n4. **Return the `question` and `answer` in a tuple.**\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- `findfirst(r\"# Question\", md)` to locate the start of the `# Question` section.\n- `findfirst(r\"# Answer\", md)` to locate the start of the `# Answer` section.\n- `strip(some_string)` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string.\n- String slicing to extract the relevant parts of the markdown.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Finding the start of the Question and Answer sections\n    q_start = findfirst(r\"# Question\", md)\n    a_start = findfirst(r\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Ensure both start markers exist\n    if q_start === nothing || a_start === nothing\n        error(\"Both # Question and # Answer sections must be present.\")\n    end\n\n    # Define the end of the Question section\n    q_content_start = q_start + length(\"# Question\")\n    q_content_end = a_start - 1\n    \n    # Define the start of the Answer content\n    a_content_start = a_start + length(\"# Answer\")\n    a_content_end = length(md)\n    \n    # Extract and strip the content for question and answer\n    question = strip(md[q_content_start:q_content_end])\n    answer = strip(md[a_content_start:a_content_end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`findfirst(r\"# Question\", md)` and `findfirst(r\"# Answer\", md)`** are used to locate the positions of the start of the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings.\n- **Offset calculations** (`q_content_start`, `q_content_end`, `a_content_start`, `a_content_end`) define slices of the input string to extract the content.\n- **`strip()`** removes any extraneous whitespace or newline characters from the extracted content.\n- The function **returns a tuple** `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Double-check:\n- **No markers found**: Error condition is handled.\n- **Correct sections**: Extracted content is what lies between the markers.\n- **Stripping**: The content is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nThis approach should correctly extract the `Question` and `Answer` sections from the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[349,605],"elapsed":6.902870833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1127223376,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
