[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Identify Useful Julia Snippets\nTo solve this problem, the following Julia functionalities will be useful:\n- **String manipulation:** We need to identify and extract specific sections from a string. `findfirst`, `findnext`, `strip`, and `sub` can be used for this purpose.\n- **Regular Expressions:** You can use regular expressions to detect where sections start.\n- **Tuple Creation:** Return the result in a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\nGiven the problem, we will:\n1. Find the starting indices of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text that falls between `# Question` and either `# Answer` or the end of the document.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing spaces or newlines from both the question and answer text.\n4. Return the result as a tuple.\n\nHere is the Julia implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # 1. Find start of `# Question` and `# Answer`\n    start_question = findfirst(r\"# Question\\b\", md)\n    start_answer = findfirst(r\"# Answer\\b\", md)\n\n    # 2. Error handling for cases where either `# Question` or `# Answer` is not found\n    if start_question === nothing || start_answer === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # 3. Extract the text content between these sections\n    end_question = start_answer - 1\n    question_text = strip(md[start_question + length(\"# Question\"):end_question])\n\n    # 4. Extract text after `# Answer`\n    answer_text = strip(md[start_answer + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n\n    # 5. Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n- **Correctness:** The solution handles different placements and the lengths of text correctly. It considers that there might be no `# Question` or `# Answer` and returns an empty result appropriately.\n- **Edge Cases:** This solution should handle cases where:\n  - Either the question section or answer section is missing.\n  - Extra whitespaces are present in the input.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an intro.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the purpose of life?\n\n# Answer\n42.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the purpose of life?\nAnswer: 42.\n```\n\nI believe the solution is correct based on the problem requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[348,568],"elapsed":7.083453792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":917640021,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
