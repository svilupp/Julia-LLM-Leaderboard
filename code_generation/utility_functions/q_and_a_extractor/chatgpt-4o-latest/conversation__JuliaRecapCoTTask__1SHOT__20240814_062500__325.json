[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Problem Solving Steps\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n1. Identify the start of the `# Question` section and the `# Answer` section within the markdown text.\n2. Extract the text between these two headers.\n3. Clean up the extracted text by stripping any leading or trailing spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets\n\n- **String slicing and manipulation** – We can use `findfirst`, `findnext`, and other string functions to locate sections within the markdown. \n- **Regex** – This can be useful to identify the headers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- **Trim** – We can use `strip` to remove extra whitespace and newlines from the extracted portions.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Assume that only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section exist.\n- The text starts with the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings and there's only one of each.\n- The question and answer sections are contiguous and in order.\n\n## Solve the Task\n\nLet's write the function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find the starting position of the headers\n    question_start = findfirst(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # If either section is not found, return empty strings\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text between these headings\n    question_text = md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start-1]\n    \n    # The answer ends at the end of the string\n    answer_text = md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end]\n    \n    # Strip leading/trailing spaces and newlines\n    question_text = strip(question_text)\n    answer_text = strip(answer_text)\n    \n    # Return the result as a tuple\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n## Double-checking the Solution\n\nNow, let's test the function with different sample inputs to make sure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris.\")\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\n# Question\n\nWhy is the sky blue?\n\n# Answer\n\nIt is due to Rayleigh scattering.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md2))  # Expected: (\"Why is the sky blue?\", \"It is due to Rayleigh scattering.\")\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the largest planet?\n\n# Answer\nJupiter.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md3))  # Expected: (\"What is the largest planet?\", \"Jupiter.\")\n```\n\nThe expected outputs should match exactly what is returned by the function. This will confirm that our solution is handling the markdown inputs correctly and giving the correct results.","status":200,"tokens":[349,633],"elapsed":6.623981417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-367921967,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
