[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's go through the task step by step to implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. The Markdown has sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. We need to extract all text that belongs to these respective sections.\n3. We will return the extracted sections as a tuple of `(question, answer)`.\n4. Stripping leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text is necessary.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- Regular expressions will be helpful to locate the text following `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- String functions like `strip`, `split`, and matching with regex (`r\"<regex_pattern>\"`) will be useful.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Locate the position of `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text that belongs to each section by finding the next section header or end of text.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing newlines or spaces.\n4. Return the extracted sections in a tuple.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start = findfirst(r\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(r\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if ismissing(question_start) || ismissing(answer_start)\n        error(\"Markdown text must contain both # Question and # Answer sections\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract the question text\n    question_text = strip(md[question_start + length(\"# Question\"):answer_start-1])\n\n    # Extract answer text up to the end or the next section (here handling till end)\n    answer_text = strip(md[answer_start + length(\"# Answer\"):end])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Double Check:\n- **Input Validation**:\n  - The function should raise an error if `# Question` or `# Answer` headers are missing.\n- **String Slicing**:\n  - The slicing starts immediately after the headers and ends before the next header (or end of file).\n- **Formatting**:\n  - We ensure any extra spaces or newlines are removed using the `strip()` function.\n\n### Sample Runs:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n# Expected output: (\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nThis implementation follows the guidelines and ensures correct extraction and formatting of the `Question` and `Answer` sections in the Markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[349,536],"elapsed":7.11406925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1034313537,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
