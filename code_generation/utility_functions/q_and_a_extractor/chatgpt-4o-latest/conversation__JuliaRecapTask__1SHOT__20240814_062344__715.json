[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\nTo solve this problem in Julia:\n\n- **Regular Expressions** and **String Manipulation** are useful tools for extracting specific patterns from text.\n- **String functions** such as `match`, `strip`, and `split` will be necessary to handle and clean up the extracted strings.\n- **Tuple creation** in Julia is straightforward with `(element1, element2)` syntax.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to:\n1. Locate the text sections following `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract these sections.\n3. Clean up each extracted section by stripping leading/trailing spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the results as a tuple.\n\nHere’s the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Find the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\n([^#]*)\", md)\n    answer_match = match(r\"# Answer\\n([^#]*)\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the content (captured group) and strip leading/trailing spaces and newlines\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Implementation\n\nLet’s review this implementation:\n- **Pattern Matching:** The regex matches `# Question` and extracts all content until the next `#` (or until the end of string).\n- **Null Handling:** If no match occurs (`nothing`), an empty string is returned.\n- **Stripping:** All leading and trailing whitespace and newlines are stripped using `strip`.\n\n### Step 4: Test the Implementation\n\nLet's see if this implementation works with different types of input:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introduction.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```julia\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nA sample test for the cases when there is no question or answer:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is an introduction.\n\n# Question\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n\n# Conclusion\nThanks for reading.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```julia\n(\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"\")\n```\n\nAnother edge case where there are multiple sections or no sections at all:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis question is aims to test.\n# Random Header\nThis is some random content.\n# Question\nAnother question ignored.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```julia\n(\"This question is aims to test.\", \"\")\n```\n\nThis approach should consistently extract the correct \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections from the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[348,649],"elapsed":7.522450333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2130970515,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
