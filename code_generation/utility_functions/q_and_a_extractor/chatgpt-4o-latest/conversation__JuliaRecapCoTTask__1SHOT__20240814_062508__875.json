[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nTo approach the problem, we'll need the following Julia functionalities:\n- **String manipulation**: We'll use functions such as `strip()`, `occursin()`, `match()`, `sub()`, and string slicing.\n- **Regular expressions**: To identify markdown headings (e.g., `# Question` and `# Answer`), we will utilize regex patterns.\n- **Tuple creation**: The output must be in the form of a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\n\n### Plan\n1. Identify the sections in the given markdown text where `# Question` and `# Answer` start.\n2. Extract the text between these headings accordingly.\n3. Strip leading and trailing whitespace/newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the result as a tuple.\n\n### Julia Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\"\n    \n    # Find the start of Question section\n    question_start = findfirst(question_pattern, md)\n    # Find the start of Answer section\n    answer_start = findfirst(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    if isnothing(question_start) || isnothing(answer_start) || question_start > answer_start\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract text between Question and Answer\n    question_text = strip(md[question_start + length(match(question_pattern, md))[1] : answer_start-1])\n    \n    # Extract text from Answer onwards till the end\n    end_of_md = findfirst(r\"#\\s*[^A-Za-z]\", md[answer_start+length(match(answer_pattern, md))[1]:])\n    if isnothing(end_of_md)\n        answer_text = strip(md[answer_start + length(match(answer_pattern, md))[1]:end])\n    else\n        answer_text = strip(md[answer_start + length(match(answer_pattern, md))[1] : answer_start + end_of_md - 1])\n    end\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n### Test Cases\n\n1. **Basic Test Case**\n   ```julia\n   md = \"\"\"\n   # Introduction\n   Some introduction text here.\n   # Question\n   What is Julia?\n   # Answer\n   Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\n   \"\"\"\n   q_and_a_extractor(md) # Expected: (\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\")\n   ```\n   Explanation:\n   - The code should extract the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and return the appropriate tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n2. **Text Before and After**\n   ```julia\n   md = \"\"\"\n   This text is irrelevant.\n   # Introduction\n   More irrelevant text.\n   # Question\n   What is 2 + 2?\n   # Answer\n   The answer is 4.\n   Another fact after the answer section.\n   \"\"\"\n   q_and_a_extractor(md) # Expected: (\"What is 2 + 2?\", \"The answer is 4.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **No Question or Answer Section**\n   ```julia\n   md = \"# Something\\nRandom text not related to questions or answers.\"\n   q_and_a_extractor(md) # Expected: (\"\", \"\")\n   ```\n\n### Final Comment\nThe current implementation should effectively extract and clean up the question and answer sections from the markdown string and return them as a tuple. After testing with the proposed test cases, it will confirm the accuracy of the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[349,768],"elapsed":7.932223375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":407463377,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
