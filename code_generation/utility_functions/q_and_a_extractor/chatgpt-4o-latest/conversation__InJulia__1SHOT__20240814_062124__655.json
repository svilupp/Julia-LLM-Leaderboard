Below is a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` and extracts the text found under the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Regular expressions to capture the question and answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s*(.+?)\\s*(?=\\#|\\z)\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s*(.+?)\\s*(?=\\#|\\z)\"\n\n    # Use Regex matching to extract the sections\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract and strip leading/trailing whitespace/newlines if matches found\n    if question_match !== nothing\n        question = strip(question_match.captures[1])\n    end\n    \n    if answer_match !== nothing\n        answer = strip(answer_match.captures[1])\n    end\n\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regular Expressions**:\n  - The `question_regex` captures the text after `# Question` until it encounters the next `#` or the end of the string.\n  - Similarly, `answer_regex` captures the text after `# Answer` until it encounters the next `#` or the end of the string.\n  \n- **match**:\n  - We use Julia's `match` function to search for these patterns within the markdown text.\n  \n- **strip**:\n  - We apply `strip` to the captured text to remove any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines.\n  \n- **Conditional Return**:\n  - If the question or answer is not found, the function returns empty strings in their place.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question \nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis\n\n# Comment\nThis is a well-known fact.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)  # Output: Question: What is the capital of France?\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)      # Output: Answer: Paris\n```\n\nThis function provides a simple way to extract structured Q&A content from markdown formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[92,484],"elapsed":6.51170075,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-66009131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
