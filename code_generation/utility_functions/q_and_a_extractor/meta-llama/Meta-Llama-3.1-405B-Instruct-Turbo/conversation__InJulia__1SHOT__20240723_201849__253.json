Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

When it encounters a line starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles the corresponding flag. It then appends each subsequent line to the corresponding section (question or answer) until it encounters another header. Finally, it strips any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines from the extracted text before returning it.","status":200,"tokens":[95,320],"elapsed":5.593549125,"cost":0.005275,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1610817978,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
