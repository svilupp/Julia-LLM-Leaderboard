We initialize two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we're currently processing a question or answer section.\n2. We iterate through each line of the markdown text using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. When we encounter a line starting with `# Question`, we set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`, and store the rest of the line (after the `# Question` prefix) in the `question` variable.\n4. When we encounter a line starting with `# Answer`, we set `in_answer` to `true` and `in_question` to `false`, and store the rest of the line (after the `# Answer` prefix) in the `answer` variable.\n5. When we're in a question or answer section, we concatenate the current line to the corresponding variable using `strip(line) * \"\\n\"`. This strips any leading spaces and newlines from the line.\n6. Finally, we return the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample markdown text, like this:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question What is the capital of France?\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(question)\nprintln(answer)\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nWhat is the capital of France?\nParis\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,475],"elapsed":3.003559667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1748626095,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
