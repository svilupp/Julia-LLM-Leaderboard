[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each section\n    for section in sections\n        # Check if the section starts with \"# Question\"\n        if startswith(section, \"# Question\")\n            # Extract the question by removing the \"# Question\" prefix and leading/trailing spaces\n            question = strip(split(section, \"# Question\")[2])\n        # Check if the section starts with \"# Answer\"\n        elseif startswith(section, \"# Answer\")\n            # Extract the answer by removing the \"# Answer\" prefix and leading/trailing spaces\n            answer = strip(split(section, \"# Answer\")[2])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the markdown text into sections using the `split` function with the newline character (`\\n\\n`) as the separator. It then iterates over each section and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the text by removing the prefix and leading/trailing spaces using the `strip` and `split` functions. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted and that the question and answer sections are separated by at least one newline character. If the input text is malformed, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[353,332],"elapsed":2.117783625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1199136433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
