[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem description, I will provide a solution using Julia. Here's the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. Initialize empty strings for the question and answer, and boolean flags to track whether we're currently processing the question or answer section.\n2. Split the input markdown text into individual lines.\n3. Iterate over each line. If the line starts with `# Question`, set the `in_question` flag to `true` and reset the `in_answer` flag. If the line starts with `# Answer`, set the `in_answer` flag to `true` and reset the `in_question` flag.\n4. If we're in the question section, append the stripped line to the `question` string. If we're in the answer section, append the stripped line to the `answer` string.\n5. Finally, return a tuple containing the stripped question and answer strings.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a markdown-formatted string as an argument, like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[353,395],"elapsed":5.620401083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1403618312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
