[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. Initialize two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text, and two flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether we are currently processing a question or an answer section.\n2. Split the input markdown text into lines using the `split` function.\n3. Iterate over each line. If the line starts with `# Question`, set `in_question` to `true` and `in_answer` to `false`. If the line starts with `# Answer`, set `in_question` to `false` and `in_answer` to `true`.\n4. If we are currently processing a question section, append the stripped line to the `question` variable. If we are currently processing an answer section, append the stripped line to the `answer` variable.\n5. Finally, return a tuple containing the stripped `question` and `answer` texts.\n\nNote that I used the `AbstractString` type annotation for the input `md` to make the function work with any type of string, and the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing spaces from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[352,376],"elapsed":6.400634416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-71155878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
