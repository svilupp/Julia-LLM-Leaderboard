Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that does what you described:\n```\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = \"\"\n    current_text = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            if current_section != \"\"\n                if current_section == \"Question\"\n                    push!(questions, strip(current_text))\n                elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n                    push!(answers, strip(current_text))\n                end\n                current_text = \"\"\n            end\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            if current_section != \"\"\n                if current_section == \"Question\"\n                    push!(questions, strip(current_text))\n                elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n                    push!(answers, strip(current_text))\n                end\n                current_text = \"\"\n            end\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n        else\n            current_text *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_section == \"Question\"\n        push!(questions, strip(current_text))\n    elseif current_section == \"Answer\"\n        push!(answers, strip(current_text))\n    end\n\n    return collect(zip(questions, answers))\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We initialize two empty arrays `questions` and `answers` to store the extracted text.\n2. We iterate through each line of the markdown text using `split(md, \"\\n\")`.\n3. We check if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, we:\n\t* If we were previously in a section, we add the current text to the corresponding array (questions or answers) and reset the current text.\n\t* We set the current section to the new section (Question or Answer).\n4. If the line doesn't start with `# Question` or `# Answer`, we add it to the current text.\n5. After iterating through all lines, we add the last section's text to the corresponding array.\n6. Finally, we return a tuple of questions and answers using `collect(zip(questions, answers))`.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample markdown text, like this:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\n# Question\nWhat is the best programming language?\n\n# Answer\nJulia, of course!\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [(\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42\"), (\"What is the best programming language?\", \"Julia, of course!\")]\n```\nI hope this helps!
