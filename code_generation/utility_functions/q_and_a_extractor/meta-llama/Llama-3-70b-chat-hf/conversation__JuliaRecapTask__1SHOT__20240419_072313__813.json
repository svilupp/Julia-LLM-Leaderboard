[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n# \")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over the sections\n    for section in sections\n        # Check if the section is a question or an answer\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            # Extract the question text\n            question = strip(replace(section, \"Question\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            # Extract the answer text\n            answer = strip(replace(section, \"Answer\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It splits the markdown text into sections using the `split` function with the separator `\"\\n# \"`.\n2. It initializes two variables, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted text.\n3. It iterates over the sections and checks if each section is a question or an answer using the `startswith` function.\n4. If the section is a question or an answer, it extracts the text by removing the leading \"Question\" or \"Answer\" using the `replace` function and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.\n5. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function with a sample markdown text, like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[352,375],"elapsed":5.929066292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-202049739,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
