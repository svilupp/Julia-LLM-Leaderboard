X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

However, since the task doesn't explicitly request a new package, I will try to solve it using only the standard library. I will use regular expressions to match the markdown sections.\n\n## Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use regular expressions to match markdown sections\n    question_match = match(r\"^# Question\\s*(.*)$\", md, 1)\n    answer_match = match(r\"^# Answer\\s*(.*)$\", md, 1)\n\n    # If both sections are found, return the extracted text\n    if question_match !== nothing && answer_match !== nothing\n        return strip(question_match[1]), strip(answer_match[1])\n    else\n        return nothing\n    end\nend\n```\n\n## Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's test the function with some sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\nAnswer: 42\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer. It uses regular expressions to match the markdown sections and strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. If both sections are found, it returns the extracted text; otherwise, it returns `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[353,373],"elapsed":2.242334333,"cost":0.00010244,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1838885870,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
