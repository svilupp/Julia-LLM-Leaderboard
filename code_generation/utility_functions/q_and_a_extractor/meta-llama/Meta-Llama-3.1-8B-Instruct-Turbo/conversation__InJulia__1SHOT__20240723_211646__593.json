We split the markdown text into sections using the `split` function with a newline character (`\\n`) as the separator.\n2. We initialize variables to store the question and answer.\n3. We iterate over the sections and check if each section starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, we extract the text from the section and strip any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` function.\n4. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the meaning of life?\nAnswer: 42\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,391],"elapsed":2.333433292,"cost":7.988e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":264592742,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
