The function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. It splits the text into sections using the `split` function with a newline character (`\\n`) as the separator.\n3. It initializes two variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. It iterates over each section in the markdown text.\n5. For each section, it checks if it's a question or an answer by checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, respectively.\n6. If it's a question, it extracts the text after the `# Question` header and stores it in the `question` variable.\n7. If it's an answer, it extracts the text after the `# Answer` header and stores it in the `answer` variable.\n8. Once it finds both the question and answer, it returns them as a tuple.\n9. If no question or answer is found, it returns an empty tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the meaning of life?\nAnswer: 42\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,486],"elapsed":3.620933375,"cost":9.698e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":887279779,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
