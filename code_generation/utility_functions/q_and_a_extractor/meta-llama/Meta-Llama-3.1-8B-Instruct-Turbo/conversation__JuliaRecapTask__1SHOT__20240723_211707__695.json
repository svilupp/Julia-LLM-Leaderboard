[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2.  We split the markdown text into sections using the `split` function with a newline character (`\\n\\n`) as the separator.\n3.  We initialize variables `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4.  We iterate over each section in the markdown text.\n5.  For each section, we check if it's a question or an answer by checking if it starts with the corresponding header.\n6.  If it's a question, we extract the text by removing the header and any leading spaces or newlines using the `strip` function.\n7.  If it's an answer, we extract the text and break the loop since we've found both question and answer.\n8.  Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is Julia.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is your name?\nAnswer: My name is Julia.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[352,467],"elapsed":3.0660755,"cost":0.00011926,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1476431215,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
