It takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to create a new vector containing only the words that satisfy the given condition.\n3. The condition `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` is a lambda function that checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. `first(word)` gets the first character of the word.\n5. `isuppercase()` checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function will keep words like \"Dog\", \"Bird\", and \"Elephant\" while removing words like \"cat\" and \"fish\" that don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,270],"elapsed":4.13056775,"cost":0.004236,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10719,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
