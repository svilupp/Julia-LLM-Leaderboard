Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Think through the approach\nWe need to create a function that:\n1. Takes a list of words as input\n2. Checks each word if it starts with a capital letter\n3. Keeps only the words that start with a capital letter\n4. Returns the filtered list\n\nStep 2: Write the function\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\nThe function is now ready to use.\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\n\nLet's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly keeps only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[181,228],"elapsed":3.468748208,"cost":0.003963,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
