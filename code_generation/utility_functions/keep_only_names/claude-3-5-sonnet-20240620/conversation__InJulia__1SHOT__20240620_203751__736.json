Here's a Julia function that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to create a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n3. The condition is defined by the lambda function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`:\n   - `first(word)` gets the first character of each word.\n   - `isuppercase()` checks if that character is uppercase.\n4. The function returns the filtered vector containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nword_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(word_list)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation is concise and efficient, as it uses Julia's built-in `filter` function, which is optimized for such operations.","status":200,"tokens":[62,283],"elapsed":4.271230542,"cost":0.004431000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29479,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
