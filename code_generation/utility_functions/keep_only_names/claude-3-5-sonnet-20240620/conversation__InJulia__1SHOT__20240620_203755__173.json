Here's a Julia function that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to create a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n3. The condition is defined by an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`, which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. `first(word)` gets the first character of the word.\n5. `isuppercase()` checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nword_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(word_list)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nThis function will return a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter, effectively keeping names (assuming names start with capital letters) and removing other words.","status":200,"tokens":[62,287],"elapsed":4.044120917,"cost":0.004491,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13542,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
