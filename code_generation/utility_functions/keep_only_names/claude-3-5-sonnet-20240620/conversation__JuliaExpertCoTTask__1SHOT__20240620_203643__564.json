[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use the `filter` function to keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nTo check if the solution is correct, we can test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly keeps only the words that start with a capital letter (\"Apple\" and \"Carrot\") and removes the others (\"banana\" and \"dog\").","status":200,"tokens":[181,283],"elapsed":4.193925666,"cost":0.004788000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20347,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
