We define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. We use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` list.\n3. The filtering condition `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. Words that start with a capital letter are kept, while others are removed.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly keeps \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" while removing \"banana\" and \"dog\".\n\nTo further verify the solution, let's test it with a few more examples:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"programming\"]))\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"a\", \"B\", \"c\", \"D\"]))\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"CAT\", \"Dog\", \"MOUSE\", \"bird\"]))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n[\"Hello\", \"Julia\"]\n[\"B\", \"D\"]\n[\"CAT\", \"Dog\", \"MOUSE\"]\n```\n\nThe function works correctly for various inputs, keeping only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[181,381],"elapsed":5.172443875,"cost":0.0062580000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22741,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
