Here's a Julia function `keep_only_names` that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down this function:\n\n1. The function takes a single argument `words`, which is expected to be a vector of strings.\n\n2. We use the `filter` function, which creates a new array containing only the elements of `words` for which the given condition is `true`.\n\n3. The condition is defined by an anonymous function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))`:\n   - `!isempty(word)` ensures that we don't try to process empty strings.\n   - `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\n4. The `filter` function applies this condition to each word in the input array and returns a new array with only the words that satisfy the condition.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently removes all words that don't start with a capital letter, keeping only the \"names\" (words starting with a capital letter) in the resulting array.","status":200,"tokens":[62,346],"elapsed":5.273265916,"cost":0.005376000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
