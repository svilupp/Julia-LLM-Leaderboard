Here's a Julia function `keep_only_names` that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to create a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n3. The condition is defined by an anonymous function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))`, which checks two things:\n   - `!isempty(word)`: Ensures the word is not empty (this is a safety check).\n   - `isuppercase(first(word))`: Checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n4. The function returns the filtered vector, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation is concise and efficient, leveraging Julia's built-in functions and functional programming capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[62,319],"elapsed":5.196598917,"cost":0.004971000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18219,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
