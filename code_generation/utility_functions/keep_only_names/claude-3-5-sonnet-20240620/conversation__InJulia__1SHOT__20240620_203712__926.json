Here's a Julia function that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down this function:\n\n1. The function is named `keep_only_names` and it takes a single argument `words`, which is expected to be a vector of strings.\n\n2. We use the `filter` function, which creates a new array containing only the elements of `words` for which the given condition is `true`.\n\n3. The condition is defined by the lambda function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`:\n   - `word` is each element in the `words` array.\n   - `first(word)` gets the first character of the word.\n   - `isuppercase()` checks if a character is uppercase.\n\n4. This condition keeps only the words where the first character is uppercase.\n\n5. The filtered array is then returned.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nword_list = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(word_list)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently removes all words that don't start with a capital letter, keeping only the \"names\" as per your requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[62,330],"elapsed":4.654637625,"cost":0.005136000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6040,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
