Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Use a list comprehension to filter the words.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter using `isuppercase()`.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n- It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n- For each `word` in the input `words` list, it checks if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))`.\n- If the condition is true, the word is included in the output list.\n\nThis solution efficiently filters the list, keeping only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[181,275],"elapsed":4.190714459,"cost":0.004668,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23128,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
