[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll write a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as its input and returns a new list that consists only of words that start with a capital letter. We'll iterate over the provided list and check the first character of each word to determine if it is uppercase.\n\nIn Julia:\n\n- We can get the first character of a string using indexing, e.g., `str[1]`.\n- We can check if a character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nLet's implement the function following these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the list of words to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's double-check that our solution is correct by asserting a few test cases:\n\n```julia\n# Case with mixed capitalization\nwords1 = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Orange\", \"grape\", \"Mango\"]\nassert(keep_only_names(words1) == [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Mango\"])\n\n# Case with all words starting with capital letters\nwords2 = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\nassert(keep_only_names(words2) == [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"])\n\n# Case with no words starting with capital letters\nwords3 = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"elephant\", \"giraffe\"]\nassert(keep_only_names(words3) == [])\n\n# Case with empty list\nwords4 = []\nassert(keep_only_names(words4) == [])\n```\n\nThis solution should correctly identify and keep words that start with a capital letter, according to the task's requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[323,370],"elapsed":31.057689875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
