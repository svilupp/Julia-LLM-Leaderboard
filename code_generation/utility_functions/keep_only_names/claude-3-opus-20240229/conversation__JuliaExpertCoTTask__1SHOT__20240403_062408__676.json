Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the filtered words\n3. Iterate over each word in the input list\n4. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter using `isuppercase`\n5. If the word starts with a capital letter, append it to the filtered words list\n6. Return the filtered words list\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly removes the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" which do not start with a capital letter, and returns only \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\".\n\nThe solution looks correct. Let me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[181,277],"elapsed":12.114600333,"cost":0.023489999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6038,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
