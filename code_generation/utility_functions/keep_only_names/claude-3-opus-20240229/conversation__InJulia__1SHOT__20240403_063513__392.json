The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n3. The `filter` function takes an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` as its first argument. This anonymous function checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter using a regular expression pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"`.\n   - `^` asserts the start of the string.\n   - `[A-Z]` matches any single character in the range of uppercase letters from A to Z.\n   - The `occursin` function checks if the regular expression pattern matches the beginning of the word.\n4. The `filter` function keeps only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., start with a capital letter) and discards the rest.\n5. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with a vector of words. It filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,425],"elapsed":17.703931792,"cost":0.032805,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15668,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
