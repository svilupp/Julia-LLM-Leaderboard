The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to create a new list containing only the words that satisfy the given condition.\n\n3. The condition is specified using an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)`, which checks if each word starts with a capital letter.\n\n   - The `occursin` function is used to check if a regular expression pattern matches a given string.\n   - The regular expression pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"` represents:\n     - `^`: Matches the start of the string.\n     - `[A-Z]`: Matches any single uppercase letter from A to Z.\n\n4. The `filter` function applies the condition to each word in the `words` vector and returns a new vector containing only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., words that start with a capital letter).\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words, and it will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"apple\" and \"cat\" are removed because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Banana\" and \"Dog\" are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[99,431],"elapsed":17.380848666,"cost":0.03381,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-586,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
