It removes the words \"apple\" and \"dog\" because they do not start with a capital letter, and returns a new vector containing only the words \"Banana\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\".","status":200,"tokens":[99,355],"elapsed":15.776161458,"cost":0.02811,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4587,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
