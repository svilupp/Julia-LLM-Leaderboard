This anonymous function checks if each word starts with a capital letter.\n- The `occursin` function is used to check if the regular expression pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches the beginning of each word. The pattern `^[A-Z]` means:\n  - `^`: Match the start of the string.\n  - `[A-Z]`: Match any uppercase letter from A to Z.\n- If a word starts with a capital letter, it is kept in the resulting list. Otherwise, it is removed.\n- Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call this function and provide a list of words to get the filtered result:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"apple\" and \"dog\" are removed because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Banana\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\" are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[62,422],"elapsed":17.663516833,"cost":0.03258,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11903,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
