The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the list and apply a predicate function to each word.\n3. The predicate function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` is an anonymous function that takes a `word` as input and checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n   - `first(word)` returns the first character of the word.\n   - `isuppercase(c)` checks if the character `c` is uppercase.\n4. The `filter` function returns a new list containing only the words that satisfy the predicate function, i.e., the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call the `keep_only_names` function with a list of words, and it will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Tiger\", \"lion\", \"Giraffe\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Cat\", \"Tiger\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nIn the above example, the words \"dog\", \"elephant\", and \"lion\" are removed from the list because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Cat\", \"Tiger\", and \"Giraffe\" are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[62,414],"elapsed":17.487232,"cost":0.031979999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11909,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
