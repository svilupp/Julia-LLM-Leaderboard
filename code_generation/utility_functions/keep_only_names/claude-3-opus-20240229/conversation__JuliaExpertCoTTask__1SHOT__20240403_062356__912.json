Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. Create an empty vector to store the filtered words.\n3. Iterate over each word in the input vector.\n4. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, append the word to the filtered words vector.\n6. Return the filtered words vector.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly keeps only the words that start with a capital letter and removes the others.","status":200,"tokens":[181,267],"elapsed":10.01243475,"cost":0.022739999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14054,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
