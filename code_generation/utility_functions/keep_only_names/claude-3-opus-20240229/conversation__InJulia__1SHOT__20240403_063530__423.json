The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n\n3. The `filter` function takes an anonymous function as its first argument. This anonymous function is defined using the arrow notation `word -> ...`, where `word` represents each individual word being processed.\n\n4. The anonymous function uses the `occursin` function to check if each word starts with a capital letter. The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` is used to match any word that begins with an uppercase letter (A-Z).\n   - `^` asserts the start of the string.\n   - `[A-Z]` matches any single character in the range from A to Z.\n\n5. The `filter` function keeps only the words that satisfy the condition specified by the anonymous function, i.e., the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n6. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of words, and it will return a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"apple\" and \"cat\" are removed because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Banana\", \"Dog\", and \"Elephant\" are kept in the resulting vector.","status":200,"tokens":[62,450],"elapsed":17.141837625,"cost":0.034679999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5740,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
