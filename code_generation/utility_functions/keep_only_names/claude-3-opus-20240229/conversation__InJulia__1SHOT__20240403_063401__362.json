The function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n3. The `filter` function takes an anonymous function as its first argument, which is defined using the `->` syntax.\n4. The anonymous function takes each `word` as input and checks if it starts with a capital letter using the `ismatch` function.\n5. The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` is used to match words that start with a capital letter. Here, `^` represents the start of the string, and `[A-Z]` represents any uppercase letter from A to Z.\n6. The `filter` function keeps only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., start with a capital letter) and returns a new vector containing those words.\n7. Finally, the function returns the filtered vector of words.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with a vector of words. It removes the words \"apple\" and \"dog\" since they do not start with a capital letter and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,406],"elapsed":17.68153975,"cost":0.03138,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18873,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
