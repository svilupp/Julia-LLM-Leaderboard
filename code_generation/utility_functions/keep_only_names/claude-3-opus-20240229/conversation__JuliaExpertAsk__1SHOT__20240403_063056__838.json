It returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,351],"elapsed":14.954602584,"cost":0.027809999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-476,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
