The function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n3. For each word, it applies an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` to check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n   - The `occursin` function checks if a regular expression pattern matches the given string.\n   - The regular expression pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches any string that starts with a capital letter (A-Z).\n4. The `filter` function keeps only the words that satisfy the condition (starting with a capital letter) and returns a new vector containing those words.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with a vector of words. It removes the words \"apple\" and \"dog\" because they do not start with a capital letter, and returns a new vector containing only the words \"Banana\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\".","status":200,"tokens":[62,383],"elapsed":15.905434333,"cost":0.029654999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
