The function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. We initialize an empty vector called `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n3. We start a `for` loop to iterate over each `word` in the `words` vector.\n\n4. Inside the loop, we check two conditions:\n   - `!isempty(word)` checks if the word is not an empty string.\n   - `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase()` function.\n\n5. If both conditions are true, it means the word starts with a capital letter, so we add it to the `names` vector using the `push!()` function.\n\n6. After the loop finishes, we return the `names` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn the example, the `keep_only_names` function removes the words \"apple\" and \"dog\" from the input vector because they don't start with a capital letter, and it returns a new vector containing only the words \"Banana\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\".","status":200,"tokens":[62,451],"elapsed":19.667709292,"cost":0.034754999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
