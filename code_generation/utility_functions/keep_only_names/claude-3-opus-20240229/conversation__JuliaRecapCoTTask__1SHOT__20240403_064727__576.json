[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that keeps only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function takes one argument `words`, annotated as an `AbstractVector` of `AbstractString` to handle any vector-like collection of strings.\n- Inside, it uses the `filter` higher-order function to keep only elements that match a predicate.\n- The predicate is an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` which checks if the `word` starts with (^) a character in the A-Z range (capital letters). \n- `occursin` is used for regular expression matching. The `r` prefix indicates a regex literal.\n- `filter` returns a new collection with only the elements that matched the predicate.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"parrot\", \"Elephant\"])\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Cat\"\n \"Elephant\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names([\"UPPERCASE\", \"Capitalized\"])  \n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"UPPERCASE\"\n \"Capitalized\"\n```\n\nThe solution is concise using a higher-order function, avoids modifying the original vector, works with any string vector type, and clearly expresses the logic with a regex matcher predicate.
