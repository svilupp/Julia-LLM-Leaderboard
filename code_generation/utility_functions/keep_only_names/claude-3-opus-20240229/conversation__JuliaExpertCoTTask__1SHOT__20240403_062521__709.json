Iterate over each word in the `words` list.\n2. Check if the first character of the word is uppercase using `isuppercase()`.\n3. If the first character is uppercase, keep the word in the list.\n4. If the first character is not uppercase, remove the word from the list.\n5. Return the updated list containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n- We use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` list and keep only the words that satisfy the given condition.\n- The condition is provided as an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`.\n- For each word, we check if the first character (`first(word)`) is uppercase using `isuppercase()`.\n- The `filter` function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNow, let's test the function with the given example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe output shows that the function correctly removed the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" from the list, keeping only the words \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe solution is correct and efficient, as it uses the built-in `filter` function to achieve the desired result in a concise manner.","status":200,"tokens":[181,409],"elapsed":17.210801583,"cost":0.033389999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14990,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
