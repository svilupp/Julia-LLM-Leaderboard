The function `keep_only_names` takes a single argument `words`, which is the list of words to be filtered.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to create a new list containing only the words that satisfy the given condition.\n\n3. The condition is specified using an anonymous function `word -> first(word) == uppercase(first(word))`. This function takes a single word as input and checks if the first character of the word is equal to its uppercase version.\n   - `first(word)` returns the first character of the word.\n   - `uppercase(first(word))` converts the first character to uppercase.\n   - The equality comparison `==` checks if the first character is already uppercase.\n\n4. The `filter` function applies this condition to each word in the `words` list and returns a new list containing only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., words that start with a capital letter).\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words, and it will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"apple\" and \"cat\" are removed from the list because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Banana\", \"Dog\", and \"Elephant\" are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[62,439],"elapsed":16.157336375,"cost":0.033854999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2321,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
