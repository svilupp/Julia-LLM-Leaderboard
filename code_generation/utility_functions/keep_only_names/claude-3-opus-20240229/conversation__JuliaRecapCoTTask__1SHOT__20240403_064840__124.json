[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that filters a list of words to keep only words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})::Vector{String}\n    filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function takes a `Vector` of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new `Vector{String}` containing the filtered words.\n- It uses the `filter` higher-order function to create a new array keeping only elements that match a predicate.\n- The predicate is an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` which returns `true` if the `word` starts with an uppercase letter `[A-Z]` at the beginning of the string `^`. \n- `occursin` checks if the regular expression matches the string.\n- The type annotation `Vector{<:AbstractString}` allows the input to be a vector of any string type while the output will be a concrete `Vector{String}`.\n\nThis concise solution leverages Julia's higher-order functions and regular expressions to filter the list in one line of code.\n\nSome examples of using it:\n\n```julia\nwords1 = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\"] \nkeep_only_names(words1) # returns [\"Banana\", \"Cat\"]\n\nwords2 = [\"UPPER\", \"lower\", \"MiXeD\"]\nkeep_only_names(words2) # returns [\"UPPER\", \"MiXeD\"] \n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[350,387],"elapsed":19.925720583,"cost":0.034275,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3636,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
