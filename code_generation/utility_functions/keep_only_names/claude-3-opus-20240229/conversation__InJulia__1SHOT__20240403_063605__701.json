The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` list.\n\n3. The `filter` function takes an anonymous function as its first argument. This anonymous function checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n   - The `first` function returns the first character of a string.\n   - The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase.\n\n4. The `filter` function applies the anonymous function to each word in the list and returns a new list containing only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., words that start with a capital letter).\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call the `keep_only_names` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Lion\", \"tiger\", \"Bear\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Lion\", \"Bear\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with a list of words. It filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Cat\", \"Lion\", \"Bear\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,396],"elapsed":16.979358,"cost":0.030629999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19020,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
