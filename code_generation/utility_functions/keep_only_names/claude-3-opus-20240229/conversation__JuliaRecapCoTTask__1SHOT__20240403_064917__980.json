[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to solve the task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a `Vector` of `String`s as input and returns a `Vector` of `String`s.\n- Inside, it uses the `filter` function which keeps elements that match a given predicate. \n- The predicate is an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` which returns `true` if the `word` starts with a capital letter (`A-Z`).\n  - `r\"^[A-Z]\"` is a regular expression that matches strings starting (`^`) with a character in the `A` to `Z` range.\n  - `occursin(pattern, string)` checks if the `pattern` occurs in the `string`.\n- `filter` returns a new array containing only the words that matched the capital letter criteria.\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\n@show keep_only_names(words)\n\n# Output: \n# keep_only_names(words) = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly kept only \"Dog\" and \"Cat\" which start with capital letters, while removing \"apple\" and \"elephant\".\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[350,353],"elapsed":16.7069095,"cost":0.031724999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26377,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
