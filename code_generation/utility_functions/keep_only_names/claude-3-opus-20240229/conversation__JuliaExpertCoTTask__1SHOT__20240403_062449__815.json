[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Iterate over the list of words\n2. Check if each word starts with a capital letter using `isuppercase(word[1])`\n3. If the word starts with a capital letter, keep it in the list\n4. If the word does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list\n5. Return the updated list\n\nHere is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Apple\"\n \"Carrot\"\n```\n\nThe function correctly removes \"banana\" and \"dog\" since they don't start with a capital letter, and keeps \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\".\n\nThe solution uses the `filter` function which applies the predicate `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` to each element in `words` and keeps only the elements for which the predicate returns `true`.\n\nThe solution is concise and correct.
