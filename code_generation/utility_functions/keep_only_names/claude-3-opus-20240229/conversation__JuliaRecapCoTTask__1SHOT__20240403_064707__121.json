[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that keeps only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a vector of strings.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` higher-order function to iterate over each `word` in `words`. \n\n3. For each `word`, we apply the anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)`. This checks if the `word` matches the regular expression `^[A-Z]`, which means it starts with a capital letter (A to Z). The `occursin` function returns `true` if there is a match, `false` otherwise.\n\n4. The `filter` function keeps only the words for which the anonymous function returns `true`, i.e., the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the filtered vector of words.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThe function uses the efficient built-in `filter` and `occursin` functions, avoiding manual iteration and string manipulation. It follows Julia conventions with type annotations and a concise implementation.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","status":200,"tokens":[350,378],"elapsed":18.190290208,"cost":0.0336,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13561,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
