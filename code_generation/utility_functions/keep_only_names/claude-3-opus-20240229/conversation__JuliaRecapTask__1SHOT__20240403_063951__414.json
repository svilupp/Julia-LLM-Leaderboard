[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that keeps only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a vector of strings.\n- It uses the `filter` function to create a new vector containing only elements that satisfy a given predicate.\n- The predicate is an anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` which returns `true` if the word starts with a capital letter (A-Z).\n  - `occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` checks if the word matches the regular expression `^[A-Z]`\n  - `^` asserts position at start of the string\n  - `[A-Z]` matches a single character in the range between A and Z (case sensitive)\n- So `filter` will keep only the words for which the anonymous function returns `true`, i.e., the words starting with a capital letter.\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # returns [\"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nThe type annotations `::Vector{String}` are used to specify that the input is a vector of strings and the output is also a vector of strings. This helps with code clarity and catching type errors.\n\nThe solution leverages Julia's `filter` and `occursin` functions along with a regular expression to concisely solve the problem.
