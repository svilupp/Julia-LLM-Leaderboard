For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"apple\" and \"cat\" are removed from the list because they do not start with a capital letter, while \"Banana\", \"Dog\", and \"Elephant\" are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[62,389],"elapsed":13.929446166,"cost":0.030104999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
