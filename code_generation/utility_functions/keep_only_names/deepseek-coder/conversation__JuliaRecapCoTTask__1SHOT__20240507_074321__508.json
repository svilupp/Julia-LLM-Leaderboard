[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to create a new list that only contains the words from the input list that start with an uppercase letter. The `filter` function takes two arguments: a function that determines which elements to keep, and a list to filter. In this case, the function is `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which returns `true` if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter, and `false` otherwise.\n\nLet's test the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"elephant\", \"Ant\", \"Bear\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis should output: `[\"Dog\", \"Mouse\", \"Ant\", \"Bear\"]`, which are the only words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[399,243],"elapsed":12.351374875,"cost":0.0001239,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2080886955,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
