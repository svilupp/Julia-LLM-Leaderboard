The `filter` function takes two arguments: a function that returns `true` for elements that should be included in the new list, and a list to filter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"elephant\", \"Ant\", \"Bear\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\", \"Ant\", \"Bear\"]\n```\n\nThis will print all the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[111,215],"elapsed":7.534161583,"cost":7.574e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1781144371,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
