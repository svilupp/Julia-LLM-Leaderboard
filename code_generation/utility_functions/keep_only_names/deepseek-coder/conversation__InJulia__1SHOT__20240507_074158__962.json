In this case, the condition is that the word should start with a capital letter. Here is how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `filter` applies the function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` to each element in `words`. This function checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is included in the output; if it is not, the word is excluded.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"mouse\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nThis will print only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[70,249],"elapsed":10.873679584,"cost":7.952e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1601730954,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
