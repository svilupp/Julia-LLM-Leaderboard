The `isupper` method checks if the first character of each word is uppercase, which includes all capital letters but also some non-English alphabet characters like Ü in German. This solution also assumes that any string without at least one character is considered not to be a valid name.","status":200,"tokens":[201,151],"elapsed":52.636115417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
