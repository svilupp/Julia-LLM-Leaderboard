Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `words` is the input list of strings. The list comprehension goes through each `word` in the `words` list and constructs a new list (`filtered_words`) containing only those words that have their first character in uppercase.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Car\", \"apple\", \"Apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Car\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThis will return a list containing only the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,265],"elapsed":2.9681305,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1261095368,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
