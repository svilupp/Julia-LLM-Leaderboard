Here is the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = Filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\n    return collect(filtered_words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Filter` function from Julia's standard library, which returns an iterator that filters elements based on a given predicate. The predicate in this case is `isuppercase(first(x))`, which checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\nThe `collect` function is then used to convert the filtered iterator back to an array.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,254],"elapsed":2.79329675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":387298358,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
