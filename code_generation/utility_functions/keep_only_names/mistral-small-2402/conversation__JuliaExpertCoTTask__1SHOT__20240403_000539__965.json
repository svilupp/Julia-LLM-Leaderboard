We define a function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of strings (`words`) as an argument.\n2. We create a new list called `filtered_words` by applying the `filter` function to the `words` list. The `filter` function takes a predicate function as an argument, which is a function that returns a boolean value. In this case, the predicate function is a lambda function that checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isupper` function.\n3. We return the `filtered_words` list.\n4. We test the function with an example list of words and print the result.\n\nThe code follows the problem-solving steps and uses the provided task and data.","status":200,"tokens":[194,291],"elapsed":3.191550375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1627313133,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
