The `isuppercase(x[1])` condition checks if the first character of a word is a capital letter. If the condition is true, the word is kept in the filtered list. Finally, the function returns the filtered list with only the names that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function in the Julia REPL like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Car\", \"apple\", \"Apple\"]\nnames_only = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names_only)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Car\", \"Apple\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[63,240],"elapsed":2.738112334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2081940903,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
