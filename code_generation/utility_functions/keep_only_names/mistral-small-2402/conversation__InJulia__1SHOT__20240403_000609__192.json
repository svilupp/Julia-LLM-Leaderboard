The `isupper` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase, and the `first` function returns the first character of a string.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Car\", \"apple\", \"Apple\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Car\", \"Apple\"]\n```\nWhich are the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,205],"elapsed":2.381260583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1945230841,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
