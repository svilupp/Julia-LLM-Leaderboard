The `filter` function applies a given condition to each element in the list, and returns a new list containing only the elements that pass the condition. In this case, the condition is `isuppercase(first(x))`, which checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,152],"elapsed":1.692802958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1698089318,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
