[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    result = AbstractString[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as an input, and returns a new vector containing only the strings that start with a capital letter. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the input vector and check if the first character of each string is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function from the Julia standard library. If the first character is uppercase, the string is added to the result vector using the `push!` function. Finally, the resulting vector is returned.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nThe function can be tested further by providing different input vectors and verifying that the output is as expected.\n\nNote that the function takes an `AbstractVector{AbstractString}` as input and returns a `Vector{AbstractString}` as output. This means that it will work with any type of vector that contains strings, such as an `Array{String}` or a `Vector{AbstractString}`. By using abstract types, the function is more flexible and can be used with a wider range of inputs.\n\nAlso note that the function does not modify the original input vector, but instead creates a new vector containing the filtered results. This is a common practice in functional programming, and it allows the function to be used in a more predictable and safe way.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nEDIT: Added annotations to the function signature to clarify input and output types.","status":200,"tokens":[372,444],"elapsed":4.889200542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-772870243,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
