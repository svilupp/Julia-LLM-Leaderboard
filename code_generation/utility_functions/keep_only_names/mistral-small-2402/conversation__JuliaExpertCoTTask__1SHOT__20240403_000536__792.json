Think through the approach step by step:\n   - The function should take a list of words as an argument.\n   - It should iterate over each word in the list.\n   - If a word starts with a capital letter, it should be included in the new list.\n   - If a word does not start with a capital letter, it should be excluded from the new list.\n   - The function should return the new list.\n\n2. Write the necessary functions and other code:\n\n```julia\nfunction is_capitalized(word)\n    return isupper(first(word))\nend\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if is_capitalized(word)\n            push!(new_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\n```\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis code first defines a helper function `is_capitalized` that checks if the first letter of a word is uppercase. Then it defines the main function `keep_only_names` that creates a new empty list and iterates over the input list, adding each word to the new list if it starts with a capital letter. Finally, it tests the function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[194,379],"elapsed":5.665833917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1669382000,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
