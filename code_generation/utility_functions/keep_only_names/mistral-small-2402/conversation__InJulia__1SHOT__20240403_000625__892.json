The function takes a predicate as an argument, which is a function that returns `true` for elements that should be kept and `false` for elements that should be removed. In this case, the predicate is `x -> isupper(x[1])`, which checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter using the `isupper` function.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Car\", \"apple\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)\n```\nThe output of this code would be:\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Car\"]\n```\nThis shows that the function removed the words \"dog\", \"cat\", and \"apple\" because they did not start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,253],"elapsed":2.789985125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2058370092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
