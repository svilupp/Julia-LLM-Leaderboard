Here's a function that does that:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(isuppercasefirst, words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `isuppercasefirst` is a built-in Julia function that checks if a string starts with an uppercase letter. The `filter` function applies this condition to every element in the `words` array and returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Car\"]\ncapitalized_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(capitalized_words)  # [\"Dog\", \"Car\"]\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Car\"]\n```\n\nSo, the function `keep_only_names` keeps only the names starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[104,249],"elapsed":2.756798541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2139252883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
