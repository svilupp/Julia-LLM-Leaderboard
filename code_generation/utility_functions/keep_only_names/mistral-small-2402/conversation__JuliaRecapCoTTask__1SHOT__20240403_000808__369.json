[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that fulfills the task description:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = filter(startswith, words, Uppercase)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of abstract strings (`AbstractVector{AbstractString}`) as input and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nTo test the function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"apple\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis should output: `[\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Banana\"]`\n\nThe function uses the `filter` function from the Julia standard library, which applies a given boolean function (in this case, `startswith`) to each element in the input collection (`words`) and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`. The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a given substring. By using `Uppercase` as the substring, we ensure that only words starting with a capital letter are kept.\n\nThe function takes advantage of Julia's multiple dispatch feature, which allows the `startswith` function to behave differently depending on the types of its arguments. In this case, `startswith` is being called with a `String` and a `Char` (the type of a single character in Julia), and it returns a boolean indicating whether the string starts with that character. By using `Uppercase` instead of a specific character, we ensure that the function works for all possible capital letters.\n\nThe function also uses generic type annotations (`AbstractVector` and `AbstractString`) to make it as flexible as possible, while still providing type stability and performance. This means that the function can be used with any collection type that implements the `AbstractVector` interface, and with any string type that implements the `AbstractString` interface.","status":200,"tokens":[372,471],"elapsed":5.119060083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1135930243,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
