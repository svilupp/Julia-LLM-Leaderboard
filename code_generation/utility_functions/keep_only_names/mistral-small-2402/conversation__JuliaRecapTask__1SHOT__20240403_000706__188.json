[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia that follows the guidelines and special instructions:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector containing only the strings that start with a capital letter. It uses a for loop to iterate over the input vector and checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function from the `Base` module. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to a new vector using the `push!` function.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `keep_only_names` function:\n```\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"carrot\", \"Durian\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n# [\"Banana\", \"Durian\"]\n```\nThis will output the following:\n```css\n[\"Banana\", \"Durian\"]\n```\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can compare the output of the `keep_only_names` function to the expected output, which is the original vector with all lowercase words removed.\n\nHere is the complete code for the `keep_only_names` function:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis function follows the guidelines for Julia programming by using a vector of strings as the input and output type, using a for loop to iterate over the input vector, using the `isuppercase` function from the `Base` module to check if the first character of a word is uppercase, and using the `push!` function to add words to the output vector. It also avoids unnecessary package dependencies and emphasizes performance, clarity, and abstract types.","status":200,"tokens":[370,519],"elapsed":5.771687625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2089762596,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
