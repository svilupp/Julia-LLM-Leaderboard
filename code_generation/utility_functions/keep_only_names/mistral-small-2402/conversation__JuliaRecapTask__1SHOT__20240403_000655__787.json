[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words array to keep only those starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(startswith, words, Uppercase)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from the Julia standard library along with the `startswith` function and the `Uppercase` constant. `filter` applies a given predicate to each element in the collection (in this case, `words`), and returns an iterator that yields only the elements for which the predicate returned `true`.\n\n`startswith` checks if a string starts with a given substring. In this case, we use the `Uppercase` constant to indicate that we want to check for capital letters.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: (\"Banana\", \"Dog\")\n```\n\nThis function complies with the guidelines provided: it uses the Julia standard library, it is type-agnostic (it works with any type that can be iterated over and that has a `startswith` method, such as `AbstractString`), it emphasizes clarity and performance, and it uses multiple dispatch.","status":200,"tokens":[370,327],"elapsed":3.638105584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":751141638,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
