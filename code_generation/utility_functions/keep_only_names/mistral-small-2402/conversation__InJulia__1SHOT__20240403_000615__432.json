It uses a for loop to iterate through the input list and checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[63,177],"elapsed":2.00478525,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1084480573,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
