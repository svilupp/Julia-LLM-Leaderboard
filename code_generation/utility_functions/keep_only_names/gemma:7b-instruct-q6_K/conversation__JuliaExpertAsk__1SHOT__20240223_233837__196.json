If the first letter is uppercase, the word is included in `uppercase_words`.\n2. **`words[isupper.(words[1:end])]`:** This expression filters the original `words` list using the `isupper` predicate. It iterates over the list and keeps only those words where the first letter is uppercase.\n3. **`return uppercase_words`:** Finally, the function returns the `uppercase_words` list, containing all words from the input list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":12.050300875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-12643,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
