We need to use a function to filter words based on their first letter being uppercase.\n\n2. **Write functions and code:** The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input and returns a new list containing only words that start with a capital letter. We use the `filter` function to filter words based on the condition `word[1].isupper`.\n\n3. **Solve the task:** With the `keep_only_names` function defined, we can call it with the provided data.\n\n4. **Check your solution:** The output of `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"carrot\", \"dog\"])` should be `[\"Apple\", \"Dog\"]`.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `isupper` method checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n- The `filter` function iterates over the list of words and returns a new list containing only words that satisfy the given condition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":19.050716875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-21222,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
