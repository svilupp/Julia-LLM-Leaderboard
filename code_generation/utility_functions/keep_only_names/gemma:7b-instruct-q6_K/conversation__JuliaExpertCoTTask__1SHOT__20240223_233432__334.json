You can use the `isupper` function.\n   - You need a function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. You can use the `filter` function.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - Pass the list of words to the `keep_only_names` function.\n   - The function will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - Print the result of the function.\n   - Verify that only words that start with a capital letter are included in the output.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[164,289],"elapsed":19.971661208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":32482,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
