So, we need to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n2. **Write functions and other code:** We define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input. We use the `filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n3. **Solve the task:** We call the `keep_only_names` function with the `words` list as input. The function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:** We print the output of the function to verify that it matches the expected result.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `isupper` method checks whether the first character of a string is uppercase.\n* The `filter` function iterates over a list and returns a new list containing the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n* The `words` list is provided as data in this task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":20.662105292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":14303,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
