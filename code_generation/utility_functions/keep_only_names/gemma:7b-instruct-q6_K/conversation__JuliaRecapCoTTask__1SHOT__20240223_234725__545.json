[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n  \"\"\"Iterates over a list of words and keeps only those that start with a capital letter.\n\n  Args:\n    words: A list of words.\n\n  Returns:\n    A list of words that start with a capital letter.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  return filter(word -> word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z', words)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words `words` as input.\n* It uses the `filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n* The `word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'` expression checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n* The function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* This function does not preserve the order of the words in the input list.\n* It does not handle Unicode characters.\n* It is recommended to use a regular expression `^[A-Z]` to match words that start with a capital letter more precisely.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":20.170869417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-27939,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
