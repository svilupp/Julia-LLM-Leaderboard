[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n  result = filter(word -> word[1].isupper, words)\n  return result\nend\n\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"carrot\", \"dog\"]\n\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Think through your approach:**\n   - You need to iterate over the list of words.\n   - You need to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n   - You can use the `isupper` function to check if the first character is uppercase.\n   - You can use the `filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code:**\n   - You need to define a function called `keep_only_names`.\n   - You need to pass the `words` list to the function.\n   - You need to use the `filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - Call the `keep_only_names` function with the `words` list.\n   - The function will return a new list containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - Print the result of the function to the console.\n   - The output should be:\n     ```\n     [\"Apple\", \"Dog\"]\n     ```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The code assumes that the `words` list is a list of strings.\n- The code uses the `isupper` function to check if the first character of a word is uppercase.\n- The code uses the `filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":24.729123417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":6350,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
