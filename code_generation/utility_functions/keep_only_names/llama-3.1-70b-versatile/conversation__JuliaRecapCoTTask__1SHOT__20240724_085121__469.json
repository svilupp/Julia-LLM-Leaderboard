[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if !islowercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension and the built-in `islowercase` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. The `first` function is used to get the first character of each word, which is then checked to see if it is lowercase. If it is not lowercase (i.e., it is uppercase), the word is included in the filtered list.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"John\", \"tree\", \"Tiger\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"John\", \"Tiger\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[328,166],"elapsed":1.061179209,"cost":0.00032465999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":754383891,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
