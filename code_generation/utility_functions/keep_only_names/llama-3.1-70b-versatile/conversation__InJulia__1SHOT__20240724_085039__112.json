If it is, the word is included in the output list.\n- The resulting list of words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function correctly identifies and returns the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,225],"elapsed":2.810665791,"cost":0.00021786999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1929376941,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
