We will use the `startswith` function in Julia to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, we will keep the word; otherwise, we will discard it.\n\n# Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the names\n    names = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, add the word to the list of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of names\n    return names\nend\n```\n\n# Step 3: Solve the task\nNow, we can use the `keep_only_names` function to solve the task.\n\n# Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\nLet's test the function with the provided data.\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, it should print `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which is the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[177,286],"elapsed":2.534530667,"cost":0.00033036999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-375129608,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
