[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task and special instructions, here is the code in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Recall Julia snippet: filter function\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `filter` function is used to create a new array with only the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n* The condition is specified using an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n* The `filter` function returns a new array with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"House\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"House\"]\n```\nDouble-check:\n\n* The solution uses the `filter` function, which is a built-in Julia function, and isupper` function, which is also a built-in Julia function, so no additional packages are required.\n* The solution uses a concise and readable syntax, with clear variable names and a single-line condition.\n* The solution is efficient, as it uses the `filter` function, which is implemented in C and is optimized for performance.\n* The solution is correct, as it correctly removes words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[328,301],"elapsed":1.588572334,"cost":0.00043130999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1579054650,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
