The function will then use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. This will be done by using the `isupper` function in Julia to check the case of the first letter of each word.\n\n## Step 2: Write the necessary function and other code\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter the list and keep only the words starting with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task using the function\n\nNow, let's call the `keep_only_names` function with the provided list of words to see the result:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check the correctness of the solution\n\nAfter executing the above function call, the expected output will be a list containing only the words that start with a capital letter, i.e., [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"].\n\n\nSo the answer to this problem will be \n\n`keep_only_names(words::Array{String}) = filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words) `","status":200,"tokens":[177,283],"elapsed":1.491035333,"cost":0.00032799999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1090543736,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
