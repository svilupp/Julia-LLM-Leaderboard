We access the first character using `word[1]`.\n4.  **Append to result list**: If the word starts with a capital letter, we append it to the `result` list using `push!`.\n5.  **Return result**: Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[177,305],"elapsed":1.620895125,"cost":0.00034537999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1790004356,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
