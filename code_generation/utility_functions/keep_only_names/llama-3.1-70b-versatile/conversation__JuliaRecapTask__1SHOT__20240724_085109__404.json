[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### keep_only_names Function\n\nHere's a function in Julia that solves the problem. It iterates over each word in the provided list and checks if the first character is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the result list.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, add the word to the result list\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```julia\n# Define a list of words\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"apple\"]\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output: `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Apple\"]`. \n\n### Double-Checking the Solution\n\nLet's double-check the solution by going through the steps:\n\n- We iterate over each word in the provided list.\n- For each word, we check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- If the first character is uppercase, we add the word to the result list.\n- Finally, we return the result list.\n\nThe solution correctly implements the required logic and should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[327,321],"elapsed":3.536387209,"cost":0.00044651999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1035745006,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
