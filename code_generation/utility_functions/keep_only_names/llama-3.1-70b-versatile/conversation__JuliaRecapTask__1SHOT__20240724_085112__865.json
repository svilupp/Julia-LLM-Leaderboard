[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n* We use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words that start with a capital letter.\n* We use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, and the `first` function to get the first character of each word.\n* We return the new list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"bird\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nI have double-checked that the solution is correct and it should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[327,224],"elapsed":1.370618458,"cost":0.00036989,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1547236040,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
