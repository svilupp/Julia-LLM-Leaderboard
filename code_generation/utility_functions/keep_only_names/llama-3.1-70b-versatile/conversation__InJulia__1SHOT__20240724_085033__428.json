We use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, we include the word in the new array.","status":200,"tokens":[68,177],"elapsed":1.055380041,"cost":0.00017994999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1810138916,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
