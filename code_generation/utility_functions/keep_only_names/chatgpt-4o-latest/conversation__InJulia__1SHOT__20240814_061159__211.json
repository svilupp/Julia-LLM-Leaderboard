Here's a Julia function called `keep_only_names` that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `words::Vector{String}` specifies that the input is an array (or vector) of strings.\n- The list comprehension `[word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]` iterates through `words` and retains only those that:\n  - Are non-empty (`!isempty(word)`).\n  - Have their first character in uppercase (`isuppercase(word[1])`).\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"zebra\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nThis function will return a new list containing only the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,220],"elapsed":2.4757135,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-164776848,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
