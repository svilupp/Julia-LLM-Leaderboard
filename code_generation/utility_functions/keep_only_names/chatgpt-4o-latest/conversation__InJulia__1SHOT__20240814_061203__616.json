Below is a function in Julia named `keep_only_names` that filters out words that don't start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`function keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}`**: This defines a function that takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a vector of strings.\n\n- **`filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isupper(first(word)), words)`**: The `filter` function iterates over each word in the `words` list. \n  - **`word ->`**: This is an anonymous function that takes `word` as an argument.\n  - **`!isempty(word)`**: This ensures that the word is not empty (as an empty string has no first letter).\n  - **`isupper(first(word))`**: This checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n  - Only words that satisfy these conditions (`!isempty(word) && isupper(first(word))`) are retained in the output list.\n\n### Example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n### Output:\n```julia\n[\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis function will remove all words from the list that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,328],"elapsed":4.364567917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1259231215,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
