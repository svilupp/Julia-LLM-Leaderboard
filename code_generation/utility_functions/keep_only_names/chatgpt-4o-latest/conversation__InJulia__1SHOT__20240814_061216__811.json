Hereâ€™s how you can write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> word[1] in 'A':'Z', words)\nend\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes in a vector of strings (`words`).\n- The function uses `filter`, which allows it to iterate over each word and keep only those for which the condition `word[1] in 'A':'Z'` is true.\n    - Here, `word[1]` accesses the first character of the word.\n    - The condition `word[1] in 'A':'Z'` checks if the first character is within the uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Eagle\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Eagle\"]\n```\n\nThis function will filter out \"cat\" and \"banana\" because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,242],"elapsed":3.774644334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1548149336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
