Here's a function in Julia to achieve that:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `words::Vector{String}`: The function takes a vector of strings as input.\n- `[word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]`: This is a list comprehension that filters the words. It checks `'isuppercase(word[1])'` to see if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, and includes the word in the result if it is.\n\n### Usage Example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Fish\", \"elephant\", \"Bird\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output will be [\"Dog\", \"Fish\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\n### Output:\n```julia\n[\"Dog\", \"Fish\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis function will remove any word from the list that does not start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,216],"elapsed":3.033308875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-216416783,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
