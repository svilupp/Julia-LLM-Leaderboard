When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Approach\n1. Iterate over the list `words`.\n2. Check if each word starts with an uppercase letter.\n3. Keep only those words that satisfy this condition.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Test\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output should be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\n### Result\nThe expected output is: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.\n\nThis will correctly filter out and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[173,180],"elapsed":2.556399875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1690174794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
