[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, we want a function that only retains words from a list that start with a capital letter and removes all others. Below, I'll provide a step-by-step plan to implement the solution in Julia.\n\n## Step Plan:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We'll define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words.\n2. **Filter Condition**: We'll iterate through the list and filter out words where the first character isn't a capital letter.\n3. **Character Check**: To check whether the first letter is capitalized, we can utilize Julia's `isupper` function.\n4. **Return Filtered List**: The function should return the filtered list.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- **`isupper(c)`**: Returns `true` if character `c` is an uppercase letter.\n- **List comprehension**: `[x for x in list if condition]` would be a very succinct way to filter our list based on a condition.\n\n### The Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`Vector{AbstractString}`**: We specify that the input is a vector (list) of strings. AbstractString allows for any kind of string-like object.\n- **`first(word)`**: Gets the first character of the word.\n- **`isupper(first(word))`**: Checks if the first character is an uppercase letter.\n- **List comprehension**: Filters and constructs a new list that only contains words starting with an uppercase letter.\n\n### Double-check:\n1. **Empty Input**: The function should return an empty list if no words start with a capital letter.\n2. **Mixed Inputs**: The function should correctly handle a mix of words with and without capitalized initials.\n3. **Case Sensitivity**: This correctly identifies only uppercase beginnings.\n\n### Sample Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bell\", \"apple\", \"Zombie\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Bell\", \"Zombie\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation is efficient, leveraging Julia's capabilities, and strictly follows the instructions. It also avoids any unnecessary complications like type specification, ensuring generality and flexibility for different string types.","status":200,"tokens":[322,493],"elapsed":5.449769584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-610374194,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
