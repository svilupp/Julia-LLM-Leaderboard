Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from the provided list that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a function `keep_only_names` that accepts a vector of strings (`words`).\n- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in `words`.\n- For each word, it uses the `occursin` function with a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"`:\n  - `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.\n  - `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.\n- If the word starts with a capital letter, it gets included in the returned list.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Horse\"]\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Horse\"]\n```\n\nThis will correctly filter out any words that do not start with an uppercase letter, leaving only those that do.","status":200,"tokens":[64,258],"elapsed":3.022776291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":559187478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
