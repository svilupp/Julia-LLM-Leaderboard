Below is the Julia function `keep_only_names` that removes words from a list if they don't start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- The function iterates over the `words` list.\n- For each word, it checks if the first character is an uppercase letter using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- If the word's first character is uppercase, it is kept in the new list.\n- Otherwise, it is discarded.\n\n### Example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Tree\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Tree\"]\n```\n\nThis will only keep the words that begin with a capital letter (\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Tree\") and remove those that don't (\"cat\", \"banana\").","status":200,"tokens":[64,214],"elapsed":2.48353125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":489287748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
