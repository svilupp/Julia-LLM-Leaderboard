Below is the Julia function `keep_only_names` which removes words from a list that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> word[1].isuppercase(), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function takes a list of words as an input: `words::Vector{String}`.\n- It uses the `filter` function which applies a predicate (a condition) to each word in the list.\n- The predicate is `word -> word[1].isuppercase()`, where `word[1]` accesses the first character of the word and checks if it is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function.\n- Only words that pass this condition (those that start with a capital letter) are kept in the new list `filtered_words`.\n- Finally, the filtered list is returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"apple\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, \"cat\" and \"apple\" are removed because they start with lowercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[64,268],"elapsed":3.00594225,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-757510078,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
