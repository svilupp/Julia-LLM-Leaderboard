[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we must iterate over the provided list of words and keep only those that start with a capital letter. Julia provides straightforward functions like `isuppercase` to check if characters are uppercase. Here’s how we can implement this:\n\n### Steps:\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes an input list `words`.\n2. We'll use Julia's `filter` function to loop through the list and retain elements based on whether the first character is uppercase.\n3. Return the resulting filtered list.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- `isuppercase(c)` - checks if the character `c` is an uppercase letter.\n- `startswith` - checks if a string starts with a particular sequence (here useful in case we check with regex).\n- `filter` - to filter elements of an array based on a condition.\n\nHere’s the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check\n- **Input Validation:** We expect `words` to be a `Vector` of `AbstractString`. The function should iterate and filter based on whether the first character is uppercase.\n- **Performance:** The use of `filter` ensures that the function is concise and efficient.\n- **Edge Cases:** \n   - Empty list.\n   - Words starting with non-letter characters (punctuations).\n   - Single-letter words.\n\n### Test the Solution\n```julia\n# Test cases\nwords1 = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"apple\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words1))  # Expected Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n\nwords2 = [\"antelope\", \"Bear\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words2))  # Expected Output: [\"Bear\"]\n\nwords3 = [\"123Cat\", \"!Dog\", \"Eagle\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words3))  # Expected Output: [\"Eagle\"]\n\nwords4 = []\nprintln(keep_only_names(words4))  # Expected Output: []\n\nwords5 = [\"X\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words5))  # Expected Output: [\"X\"]\n```\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n- This solution should work correctly and efficiently while handling all specified edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[322,469],"elapsed":5.204891958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1638012548,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
