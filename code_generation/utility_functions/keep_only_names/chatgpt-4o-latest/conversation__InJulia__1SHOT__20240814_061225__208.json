Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that filters and keeps only the words starting with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")]\nend\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n- The function uses a list comprehension `[word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")]` to iterate over each word.\n- `startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")` checks if the `word` starts with an uppercase letter using a regular expression.\n- Only words that satisfy the condition are kept in the returned list.\n\n### Example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will remove \"cat\" and \"fish\" because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,260],"elapsed":2.805143792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1192398562,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
