Below is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use the filter function to keep only words starting with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `filter` is a Julia function that returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the supplied function (`word -> ...`) returns `true`.\n- `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])` is an anonymous function that checks if the word is non-empty (`!isempty(word)`) and if the first character (`word[1]`) is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\n[\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nHere, only the words \"Apple\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\" are kept because they start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,266],"elapsed":3.366306417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1589471285,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
