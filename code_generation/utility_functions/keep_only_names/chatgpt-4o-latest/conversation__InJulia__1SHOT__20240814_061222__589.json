Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that filters out words in a list that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes an array of strings `words` as input.\n- It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the list:\n  - For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))`.\n  - The `!isempty(word)` condition ensures that empty strings are handled correctly to avoid errors.\n- Only words that start with an uppercase letter are kept, and the rest are removed.\n- The function returns a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,242],"elapsed":2.832979834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1517770117,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
