[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you will need to iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts with a capital letter. If a word does not start with a capital letter, it should be removed from the list.\n\nLet's walk through the steps to implement this in Julia:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Create the function**: Define the `keep_only_names` function which accepts a list of words.\n2. **Check for Capitalization**: Use Julia's `startswith` function with a range of capital letters (`'A':'Z'`) to determine if a word starts with a capital letter.\n3. **Filter the List**: Filter the list to retain only words that start with a capital letter.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the filtered list.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- **String starts with a capital letter**: `startswith(word, 'A':'Z')`\n- **Filtering a List**: `filter(condition, collection)`\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word[1], 'A':'Z'), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `startswith(word[1], 'A':'Z')` checks if the first character of `word` is in the range `'A'` to `'Z'`. \n- The `filter` function is used to iterate over all words in `words` and keep only those that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Double-checking:\n- Ensure the function correctly handles various cases like:\n  - Words starting with numbers or special characters (e.g., \"1dog\", \"#dog\").\n  - Empty strings.\n  - Mixed-case scenarios.\n\nHereâ€™s some example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Fish\", \"elephant\", \"Mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Should print [\"Dog\", \"Fish\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nThis solution should be efficient and clear, adhering to the problem requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[322,421],"elapsed":4.815114125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1159837826,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
