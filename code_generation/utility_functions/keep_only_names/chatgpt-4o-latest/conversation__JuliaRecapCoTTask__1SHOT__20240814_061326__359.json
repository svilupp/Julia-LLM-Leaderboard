[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need:\n- A function definition in Julia: `function f(x) end`\n- Iterating over a list/array: `for item in list`\n- Conditionals: `if-else`\n- Julia strings have the function `isuppercase` to check if a character is uppercase.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe'll define the function `keep_only_names`. The function will iterate over the list of words, check if each word starts with a capital letter, and retain only those words that satisfy this condition.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `words` can be a `Vector` of `AbstractString` (to handle various kinds of strings).\n- We initialize an empty array `result` where we'll store the words that start with a capital letter.\n- `for word in words`: Iterate over each word in the list.\n- `!isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))`: Check if the word is non-empty and the first character is uppercase.\n- `push!(result, word)`: Append the word that starts with a capital letter to the `result` array.\n- Finally, return the `result` array containing only the desired words.\n\n## Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n\nLet's test the function with a variety of cases:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"apple\", \"Banana\", \"\"]))\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Zebra\", \"lion\", \"Airport\"]))\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Moon\", \"star\", \"Tree\"]))\n```\n\nExpected outputs:\n1. `[\"Dog\", \"Banana\"]`\n2. `[\"Zebra\", \"Airport\"]`\n3. `[\"Moon\", \"Tree\"]`\n\nThe function should correctly return arrays containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n---\n\nThe solution has been implemented with proper consideration for edge cases like empty strings, and it's efficient given the problem's requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[322,475],"elapsed":6.360547333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1562483067,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
