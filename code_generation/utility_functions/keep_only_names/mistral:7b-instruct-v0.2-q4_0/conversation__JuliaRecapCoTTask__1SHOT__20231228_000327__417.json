X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instruction provided, here are the steps to write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n- Control structures `for`, `if`, `elseif`, `else`\n- String manipulation functions like `lowercase()`, `capitalizefirst()`\n- List manipulation functions like `filter()`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n  filtered_words = filter(x -> isfirstletter(capitalizefirst(string(x))) || isempty(x), words)\n  return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes a list of strings (`words`) as an argument and returns a new list containing only the words that have a capitalized first letter. The function uses the `filter()` function to apply a boolean condition on each word in the input list using the anonymous function provided as the first argument. This function checks if either the string is empty or its first character is capitalized, and only keeps the elements (words) for which this condition is met.","status":200,"tokens":[374,277],"elapsed":10.441783459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
