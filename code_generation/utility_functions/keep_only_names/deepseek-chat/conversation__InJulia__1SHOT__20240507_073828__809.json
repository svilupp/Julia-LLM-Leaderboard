For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is kept, otherwise it is removed. The result is a new list that only contains words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,116],"elapsed":8.061992208,"cost":4.13e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1398472568,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
