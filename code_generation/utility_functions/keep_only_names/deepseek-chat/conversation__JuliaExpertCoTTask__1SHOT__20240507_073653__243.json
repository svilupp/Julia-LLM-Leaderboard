The `startswith` function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase, and the `uppercase` function is used to ensure that the comparison is case-sensitive.","status":200,"tokens":[188,183],"elapsed":13.601135333,"cost":7.756000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1369218760,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
