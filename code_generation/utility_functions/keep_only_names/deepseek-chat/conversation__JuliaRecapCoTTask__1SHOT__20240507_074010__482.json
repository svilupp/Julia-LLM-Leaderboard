[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task, we will create a function `keep_only_names` that iterates over the provided list of words and checks if each word starts with a capital letter. If it does, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list. Here's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{AbstractString})\n    # Filter the words list to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library, which applies a function to each element of a collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returned `true`. In this case, the function `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase, which is a common convention for names in English.\n\nNow, let's test the function with a sample list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Alice\", \"apple\", \"Bob\", \"banana\", \"Charlie\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n[\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` has been implemented according to the task description, and it should work as expected for any list of words. If there are any special instructions provided, they should be incorporated into the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[351,336],"elapsed":20.098880708,"cost":0.00014322,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1820292883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
