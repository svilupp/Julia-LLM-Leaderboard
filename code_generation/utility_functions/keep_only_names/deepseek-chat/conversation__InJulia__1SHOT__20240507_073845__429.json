The `filter` function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. In this case, the function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed. The resulting list of words is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[63,136],"elapsed":9.003827167,"cost":4.69e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1868960339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
