[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Keep only names that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the names\n    names = AbstractString[]\n\n    # Iterate through the words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter is a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, append it to the list of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the list of names\n    return names\nend\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"iguana\", \"Rabbit\"]\nonly_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(only_names) # [\"Dog\", \"Bear\", \"Rabbit\"]\n\n# Check the function with empty and singleton list\n@test keep_only_names([]) == []\n@test keep_only_names([\"dog\"]) == []\n```<|im_end|>\n<|endoftext|>","status":200,"tokens":[325,197],"elapsed":3.811174542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1990440068,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
