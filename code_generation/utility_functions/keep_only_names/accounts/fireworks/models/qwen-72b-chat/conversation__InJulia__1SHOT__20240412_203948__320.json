It then iterates over each `word` in `words` and checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, it adds the word to the `names` list using the `push!` function.\nFinally, the function returns the list of capitalized words.\nHere's an example of how you can use the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\", \"Bird\", \"Rabbit\"]\ncapitalized_words = keep_only_names(words)\n println(capitalized_words)\n#","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":3.811026375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1705391214,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
