The input is a vector of strings `words`.\n  2. We create an empty vector `names` to store the names that we want to keep.\n  3. We iterate over each word in `words` using a for loop.\n  4. For each word, we use the `occursin` function and a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` to check if the word starts with a capital letter. The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches a string that starts with a capital letter.\n  5.","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":3.878864,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-486006583,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
