We then iterate over each word in the provided `words` list, and use the `beginswith` function to check if the word starts with a capital letter. If it does, we push the word to the `names` list. Finally, we return the `names` list.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|><|im_start|>\n<|im_start|>å¿‘<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|><|im_start|>\nI'm sorry, I don't understand your request.
