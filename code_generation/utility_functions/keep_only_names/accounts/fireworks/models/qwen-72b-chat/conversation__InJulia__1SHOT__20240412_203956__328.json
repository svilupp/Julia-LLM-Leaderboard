The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each word in `words`, and an `if` statement to check if the word starts with a capital letter using the `uppercase` function and the first character of the string (`word[1]`). If the word starts with a capital letter, it's added to the `names` vector using the `push!` function.\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```julia\njulia","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":3.832631916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1856888675,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
