Here's how you can write the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> uppercase:first(word) == first(word), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere, `filter` takes two arguments: a function that returns a boolean value and the list to filter. The function applied to each element of the list checks if the first character of the string is the same as its uppercase version. If it is, it means that the word starts with a capital letter and is kept, otherwise it is removed from the list.\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"tree\", \"Bird\"]\nkept_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(kept_words)\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"Bird\"]\n``","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":3.793575833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-876002931,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
