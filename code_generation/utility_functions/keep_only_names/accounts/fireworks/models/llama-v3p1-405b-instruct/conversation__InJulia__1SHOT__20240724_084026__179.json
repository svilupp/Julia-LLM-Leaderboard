It returns an iterator that produces the elements of the original iterator where the predicate is true.\n2. `isuppercase`: This function checks whether the word starts with an uppercase letter.\n3. `first`: This function is used to get the first character of the word.\n7. `words`: This is an array of strings, the input words to be filtered.\n\nUpon running this function on a vector of words, it will return a new vector of words with only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nword_list = [\"dog\", \"Bird\", \"This\", \"That\", \"cat\"]\ncleansed_word_list = keep_only_names(word_list)\nprintln(cleansed_word_list)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```julia\n3-element Vector{String}:\n\"\\\"Bird\", \\\"This\\\", \\\"That\"\\\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[67,247],"elapsed":7.951786084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-7855996,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
