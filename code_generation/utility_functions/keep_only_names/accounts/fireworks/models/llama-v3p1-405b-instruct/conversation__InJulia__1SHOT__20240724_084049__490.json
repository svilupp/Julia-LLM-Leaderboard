The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words that meet a certain condition.\n3. The condition is that the first character of the word (`word[1]`) must be uppercase. We use the `isuppercase` function to check this.\n4. The function returns the new list that only includes the words that meet the condition.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAT\", \"Elephant\"]\n[\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAT\", \"Elephant\"]\n\njulia> filtered_words = keep_only_names(words) \n[\"Dog\", \"CAT\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\nAs you can see, the function successfully removes the words that do not start with a capital letter. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.","status":200,"tokens":[67,259],"elapsed":10.868021458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":19089973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
