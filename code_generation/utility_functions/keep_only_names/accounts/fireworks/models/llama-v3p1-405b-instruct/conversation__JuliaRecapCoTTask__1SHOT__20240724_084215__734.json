[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"/**\n * The function `keep_only_names` filters a provided array of words to keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n * \n * This function assumes that the provided list of words is a list of strings in the English language where the first letter of a word determines whether it is a proper noun (eg, a name).\n * \n * @param {string[]} words - An array of strings in the English language.\n * @returns {string[]} - The input array but filtered to only include words that start with a capital letter.\n */\nfunction keep_only_names(words) {\n    // Filter the input array into a new array\n    return words.filter((item) => {\n        // Filter out any non-strings from the array (although none were provided)\n        if (typeof item !== \"string\") return false;\n\n        // Check if the first character of the string is a character and is an uppercase letter\n        let char = item.charAt(0);\n        if (item.length === 0 || char.length) {\n            return char === char.toUpperCase();\n        }\n\n        // If the first character is not a character (eg, is an emoji), filter it out\n        return false;\n    });\n}","status":200,"tokens":[326,246],"elapsed":8.606079541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":194381851,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
