[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"/**\n * This function filters a list of words to only include words that start with a capital letter.\n *\n * @param words A list of words to be filtered\n * @return A list of words that start with a capital letter\n */\nfunction keep_only_names(words) {\n    // Initialize an empty list to store the filtered words\n    let filtered_words = [];\n\n    // Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for (let word of words) {\n        // Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if (word[0].toUpperCase() === word[0]) {\n            // If the word starts with a capital letter, add it to the filtered list\n            filtered_words.push(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Return the filtered list of words\n    return filtered_words;\n}","status":200,"tokens":[326,165],"elapsed":6.823555208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-650986475,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
