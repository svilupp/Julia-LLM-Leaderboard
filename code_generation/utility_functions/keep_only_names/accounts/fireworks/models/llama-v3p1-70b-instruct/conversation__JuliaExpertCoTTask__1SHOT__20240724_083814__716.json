We will iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter. If it does, we will keep it in the list; otherwise, we will remove it.\n\n# Step 2: Write any functions and other code we need\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    names = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it does, add it to the list of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of names\n    return names\nend\n```\n\n# Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow that we have the `keep_only_names` function, we can use it to solve the task by calling it with the provided list of words.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n# Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` correctly identifies the words that start with a capital letter and returns them as a list.","status":200,"tokens":[176,320],"elapsed":2.501258833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1255157983,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
