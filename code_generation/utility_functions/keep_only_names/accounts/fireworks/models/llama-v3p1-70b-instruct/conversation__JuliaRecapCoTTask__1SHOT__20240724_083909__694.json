[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nWe will use the following Julia snippets for this task:\n- The `ismatch` function to check if a string matches a regular expression. We can use this to check if a word starts with a capital letter.\n- The `filter` function to remove elements from a list that don't meet a condition.\n- Regular expressions, specifically the `r\"^[A-Z]\"` pattern to match words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", x), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo test this function, we can use a sample list of words. \n\n```julia\nwords = [\"John\", \"dog\", \"Jane\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis should print: `[\"John\", \"Jane\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[326,210],"elapsed":4.313844083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1976217029,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
