We will iterate over each word in the list, checking if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function in Julia. If it is, we will add the word to a new list.\n\n### Step 2: Write the necessary code\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nWe will now call the `keep_only_names` function with the provided list of words.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n\nWe can verify that the output of the function is correct by manually checking the list. The function should return a list of words that start with a capital letter, which in this case is [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"].","status":200,"tokens":[176,260],"elapsed":3.6467,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":840208416,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
