[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a well-structured and readable Julia code snippet that meets the requirements:\n\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create a new array to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the input list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, append the word to the filtered list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the filtered list of words\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as an argument.\n2. We create an empty array `filtered_words` to store the filtered words.\n3. We iterate over each word in the input list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each word, we check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we append the word to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function.\n6. Finally, we return the filtered list of words.\n\nExample usage:\n\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThis code is concise, readable, and follows the Julia language guidelines.
