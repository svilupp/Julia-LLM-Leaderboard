For each word, it checks if the first character is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is included in the new list. The function then returns this filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[67,245],"elapsed":2.441981125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1615200099,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
