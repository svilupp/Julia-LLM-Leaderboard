[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function iterates over the provided list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    words (list): A list of words\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of words that start with a capital letter\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if word[0].isupper():\n            # If the word starts with a capital letter, add it to the list of capitalized words\n            capitalized_words.append(word)\n    \n    # Return the list of capitalized words\n    return capitalized_words\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"bird\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[325,210],"elapsed":3.209226208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":363215268,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
