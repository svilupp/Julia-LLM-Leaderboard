If it is, the word is included in the new list.\n* We return the new list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example use case:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"hello\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the input list only contains strings. If the input list can contain other types of elements, you may need to add additional error checking.","status":200,"tokens":[67,253],"elapsed":2.578937958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1917123148,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
