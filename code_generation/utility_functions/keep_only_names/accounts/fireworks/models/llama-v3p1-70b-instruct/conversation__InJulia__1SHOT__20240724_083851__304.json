We define the function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of words as its input.\n2.  Inside the function, we initiate an empty array called `filtered_words` to store the filtered words.\n3.  We iterate over each word in the input list.\n4.  We check if the first character of the current word is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function.\n5.  If the word starts with a capital letter, we append it to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function.\n6.  Finally, we return the filtered list of words.\n\n### Alternative Solution Using List Comprehension\n\nYou can achieve the same result using a list comprehension in a more concise way:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to create a new array with only the words that start with an uppercase letter. The condition `isuppercase(word[1])` filters the words in the same way as the previous example.","status":200,"tokens":[67,421],"elapsed":4.333762,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-908996440,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
