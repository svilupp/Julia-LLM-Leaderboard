[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a high-quality, readable, and well-documented function in Julia that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\n# Function to filter names from a list of words\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter words starting with a capital letter\n    names = [word for word in words if isupper(word[1])]\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example use case:\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"car\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"House\"]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words (`words`) as input, and returns a new list (`names`) containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `isupper(word[1])` condition checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. A list comprehension is then used to create the new list. The example use case demonstrates how the function can be used.","status":200,"tokens":[325,199],"elapsed":0.791567292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1348848660,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
