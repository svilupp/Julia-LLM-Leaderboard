[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that meets the requirements:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list to only include words that start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n* The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input.\n* We use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the words from the original list that start with a capital letter.\n* We use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n* The function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"HELLO\", \"world\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"HELLO\"]\n```\nNote that this implementation uses a list comprehension, which is a concise and efficient way to create new lists in Julia. We also use the `isuppercase` function to check if a character is uppercase, which is a straightforward way to do this in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[326,234],"elapsed":1.1614485,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-703672227,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
