If we want to exclude such cases, we need to check for both conditions. Here's a revised version:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words to keep only those that start with a capital letter (excluding capital letters followed by numbers)\n    return filter(x -> startsWithUpper(x) && !startsWithNumerical(x), words)\nend\n\nfunction startsWithUpper(word)\n    return uppercasefirst(word[1]) == word[1] && !all('\\x30' <= c <= '\\x39' for c in word[1])\nend\n\nfunction startsWithNumerical(word)\n    if length(word) == 1\n        return false\n    else\n        return uppercasefirst(word[1]) == word[1] && !uppercasefirst(word[2]) == word[2]\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"MAN\", \"apple\", \"Paper1\", \"D1\"]\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"MAN\", \"Paper\"]\n```\n\nBut if I were to simplify the function to meet the requirements without additional custom functions, here's a simplified version:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if uppercasefirst(word[1]) == word[1]]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"MAN\", \"apple\", \"Paper1\", \"D1\"]\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"MAN\", \"Paper\"]\n```\n\nPlease ensure the above revised code works as expected in a Julia environment.","status":200,"tokens":[67,461],"elapsed":1.626005625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1782078885,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
