The `isspacefirst` function is used to check if a word is fully capitalized (i.e., its first character is a space and all other characters are upper case) which is equivalent to checking if a word starts with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[176,149],"elapsed":0.617169458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-150319789,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
