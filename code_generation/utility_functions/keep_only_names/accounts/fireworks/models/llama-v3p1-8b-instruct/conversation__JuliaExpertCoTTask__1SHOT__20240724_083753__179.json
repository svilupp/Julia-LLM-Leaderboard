I start by identifying the steps I need to follow to solve the problem. This involves creating a function called `keep_only_names`, which will filter through the provided `words` list and remove any words that do not begin with an uppercase letter.\n\n2. I write the code needed to perform the `keep_only_names` function. This function utilizes the `filter` function, a standard function in Julia for filtering datasets or lists, to return a new list containing words that begin with an uppercase letter (due to `isuppercase(x[1])`), where `x[1]` refers to the first character of each word `\"x\"` in the list.\n\n3. I solve the task by calling the `keep_only_names()` function on the provided list of words `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]` and output the result.\n\n4. I check that the solution is correct. This is done by manually examining the function's output. In this case, since I already know what the output is supposed to be (\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"), I confirm that the solution does, indeed, produce the correct output.","status":200,"tokens":[176,290],"elapsed":1.063178792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1954344727,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
