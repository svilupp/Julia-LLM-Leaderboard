We define the function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of words `words` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use a for loop to iterate over each word in the input list `words`.\n3. For each word, we check if it starts with a capital letter by using the `startswith` function and comparing it to the uppercase version of the first character of the word.\n4. If the word starts with a capital letter, we use the `push!` function to add it to the `filtered_words` list, which will store the words that pass the condition.\n5. Finally, we return the `filtered_words` list at the end of the function.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAT\", \"apple\", \"Apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"CAT\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nNote that in Julia, we use the `startswith` function to check if a string starts with a certain prefix, but in this case, we pass in the uppercase version of the first character of the word to check if the word starts with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[67,341],"elapsed":1.274048167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1622171953,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
