[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code with explanations:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Using a filter function to keep only words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(w -> isuppercase(w[1]), words)\nend\n\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\"]\nnew_words_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(new_words_list)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `keep_only_names` function takes an array of words (`words`) as input and returns a new array with the words filtered.\n- The `filter` function is used to iterate over the array of words and apply the condition.\n- The condition is defined by the lambda function `w -> isuppercase(w[1])`. This function will check if the first letter of each word is capital (using `isuppercase`) and keep only the words satisfying this condition.\n- Finally, the new array of words is printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[326,189],"elapsed":0.832648,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-822107504,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
