[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that meets the Task and follows Julia language syntax guidelines:\n```\n# Define function keep_only_names\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words array and return words that start with uppercase letter\n    filter(x -> isuppercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n\n# Test function\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"rat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\n# Display filtered words\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\nIn this code:\n\n- We first define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words (`words`) as an argument.\n- Inside the function, we use the built-in `filter` function, which removes all words that do not start with a capital letter using the conditional expression `x -> isuppercase(first(x))`. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of each word (`first(x)`) is a UPPERCASE letter. If it is, the word is included in the filtered list.\n- Finally, we test the function with a list of words and print the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[326,224],"elapsed":0.871793375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1193850790,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
