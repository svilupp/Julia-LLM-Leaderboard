[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that meets the task requirements:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\nNote: In Julia, the `first(word)` function returns the first character of `word`, and `isuppercase(x)` returns `true` if `x` is an uppercase letter.\n\nLet me explain what this code does:\n\n1. The `for` loop iterates over the `words` array.\n2. The `if` condition checks if the first character of each word (`first(word)`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n3. If the first character is uppercase, the word is included in the new array using the array comprehension syntax `[...]`.\n4. Finally, the function returns the new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"CAT\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"CAT\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[326,227],"elapsed":0.897955625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2087020677,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
