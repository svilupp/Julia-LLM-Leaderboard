[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a well-structured and readable Julia function to solve the problem:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the names (words starting with a capital letter)\n    names = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it's a name, add it to the vector of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of names\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAR\", \"sun\", \"Sun\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"CAR\", \"Sun\"]\n```\nIn this code, I used Julia's standard library to perform the following tasks:\n\n1.  The `if isuppercase(word[1]):` condition checks if the word's first character (`word[1]`) is uppercase, which determines whether the word is a name or not.\n2.  The `push!(names, word)` statement adds the word to the `names` vector if it's a name.\n3.  The function returns the vector of names at the end.\n\nNote that Julia's performance is top-notch due to its Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, the function is self-documenting and easy to understand, following the guidelines for performance, clarity, and code organization.","status":200,"tokens":[325,323],"elapsed":1.177517834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-932817574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
