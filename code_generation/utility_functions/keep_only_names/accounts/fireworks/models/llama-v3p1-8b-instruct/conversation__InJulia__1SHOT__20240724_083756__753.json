If it is, we add the word to the `filtered_words` list using `push!`.\n* Finally, we return the `filtered_words` list, which contains only the words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nNote that this implementation uses a simple and efficient approach, but it doesn't handle edge cases like empty input lists or lists containing non-string elements. If you need to support such cases, you may need to add additional error handling or input validation.","status":200,"tokens":[67,340],"elapsed":1.206056459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2008441435,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
