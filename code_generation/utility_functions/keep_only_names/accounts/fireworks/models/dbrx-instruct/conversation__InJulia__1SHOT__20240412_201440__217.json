The `filter` function applies a given predicate function (in this case `isuppercase(first(word))`) to each element of the input list and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate function returns `true`.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\", \"Monkey\"];\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Elephant\"\n \"Monkey\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` filters out the words \"cat\", \"bird\"","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":4.242903542,"cost":0.00042559999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-530806485,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
