[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a function `keep_only_names` that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the vector. The `filter` function applies a given function (`isuppercase(first(word))` in this case) to each element in the vector and returns a new vector that contains only the elements for which the function returns `true`.\n\nThe function `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word is included in the output vector.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Tree","status":200,"tokens":[324,200],"elapsed":3.643720042,"cost":0.0008384,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1372781367,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
