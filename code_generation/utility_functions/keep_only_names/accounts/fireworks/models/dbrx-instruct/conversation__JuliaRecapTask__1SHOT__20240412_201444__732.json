[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a Julia function that implements the requested behavior:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis function takes an array of strings `words` as input and returns a new array `filtered_words` that contains only the words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase, and the `first` function returns the first character of a string. The `filter` function applies a given predicate (in this case, the anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`) to each element of the input array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which the predicate returns `true`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Tree\", \"ball\"];","status":200,"tokens":[324,200],"elapsed":3.648692834,"cost":0.0008384,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1560410847,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
