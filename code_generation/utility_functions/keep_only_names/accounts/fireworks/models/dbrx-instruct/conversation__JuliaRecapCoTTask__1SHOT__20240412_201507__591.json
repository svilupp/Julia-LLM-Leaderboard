[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow your special instructions and prioritize them over the general guidelines. Here's the function `keep_only_names` that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of any type of string (`<:AbstractString`) as input and returns a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `filter` function applies a given condition to each element of the input array and returns a new array with the elements that satisfy the condition. In this case, the condition is that the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, which is checked using the `isuppercase` and `first` functions.","status":200,"tokens":[325,161],"elapsed":3.9673615,"cost":0.0007775999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1805061150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
