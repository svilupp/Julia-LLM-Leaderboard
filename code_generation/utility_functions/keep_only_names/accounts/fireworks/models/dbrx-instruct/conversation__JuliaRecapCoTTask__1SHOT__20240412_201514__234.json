Based on the special instructions you provided, I will write the function `keep_only_names` in Julia using a systematic approach.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task\n2. Solve the task\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia syntax and features. We can use a for loop to iterate over the elements in a list, and the `isuppercase()` function to check if a character is a capital letter. We can also use the `filter()` function to create a new list containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition.\n\nNow, let's solve the task. Here's the function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use the filter() function to create a new list containing only the words\n    # that start with a capital letter\n    filtered","status":200,"tokens":[325,200],"elapsed":3.687031083,"cost":0.0008399999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1726204897,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
