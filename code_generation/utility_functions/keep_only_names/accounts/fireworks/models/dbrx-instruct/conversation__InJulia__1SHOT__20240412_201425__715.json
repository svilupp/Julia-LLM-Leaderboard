We use a regular expression `^[A-Z]` to check if the first character of the word is a capital letter. If it is, we add the word to the `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: The `ismatch` function has been deprecated in Julia 1.0 and later versions. Instead, you can use the `occursin` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":5.611429667,"cost":0.00042559999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-209793282,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
