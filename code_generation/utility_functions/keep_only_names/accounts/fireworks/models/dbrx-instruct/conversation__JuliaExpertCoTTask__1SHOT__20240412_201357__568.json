To solve this task, I will create a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input. This function will iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter. If it does, the function will keep the word; otherwise, it will remove it.\n2. Here is the code for the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n3.
