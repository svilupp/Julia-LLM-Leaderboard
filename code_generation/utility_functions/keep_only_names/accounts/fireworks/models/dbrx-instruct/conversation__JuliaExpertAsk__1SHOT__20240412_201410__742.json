The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a string is uppercase, and `first` returns the first character of a string.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Tree\", \"house\", \"Apple\"];\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Tree\"\n \"Apple\"\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[101,181],"elapsed":3.934845875,"cost":0.0004512,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1607563864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
