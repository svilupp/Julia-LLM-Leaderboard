Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia to iterate over the words in the list. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list. If not, it is removed.\n\nLet's test the function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis should print: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[194,194],"elapsed":4.634468,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2034021087,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
