Here's a simple function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia to iterate over the list of words. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list. If not, it's removed.","status":200,"tokens":[63,128],"elapsed":3.000141334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-311818673,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
