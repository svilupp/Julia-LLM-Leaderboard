[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write a function in Julia to solve this task. Here's a simple function that uses list comprehension to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` is a type annotation for the input argument `words`. It means `words` is expected to be a 1D array (vector) of strings.\n- `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of `word` is an uppercase letter.\n- The list comprehension `[word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]` generates a new array containing only the words from `words` that start with an uppercase letter.\n- The return type of the function is also annotated as `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}`, indicating that the function returns a 1D array of strings.\n\nThis function should perform well and be clear to read, in line with the Julia guidelines you provided. As there are no special instructions, I've used the standard library functions `isuppercase` and `first` to solve the task.","status":200,"tokens":[370,313],"elapsed":6.923207459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1043678557,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
