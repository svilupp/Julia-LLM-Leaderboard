If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words and returns a new list that only contains the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia, which applies a given function to each element of a collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`. In this case, the function we're using is `isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[194,300],"elapsed":7.068047458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-950704485,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
