[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write the function `keep_only_names` in Julia. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input list. It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Horse\", \"bird\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Horse\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[372,250],"elapsed":5.76767575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1602180391,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
