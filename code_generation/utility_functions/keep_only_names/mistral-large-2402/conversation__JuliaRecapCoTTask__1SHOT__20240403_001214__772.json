[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia. Here's a simple way to do it using list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists based on existing ones. In this case, we'll create a new list that only includes the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `words` is the input list of words.\n- `[word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]` is a list comprehension that iterates over each `word` in `words`. It checks if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is included in the new list.\n- The function then returns this new list.\n\nThis function should work for any list of strings, and it doesn't require any special packages, just the standard Julia language features. It also uses general type annotations, as the input `words` can be any iterable of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[372,273],"elapsed":6.115620167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1892232382,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
