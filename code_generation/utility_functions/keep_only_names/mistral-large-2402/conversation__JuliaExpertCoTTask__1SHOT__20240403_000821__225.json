Here's how I would approach this task in Julia:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Iterate over the list of words.\n   - Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n   - If it does, keep the word. If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `keep_only_names` does this. It uses the `filter` function in Julia to keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis should return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[194,268],"elapsed":6.120339041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2067378433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
