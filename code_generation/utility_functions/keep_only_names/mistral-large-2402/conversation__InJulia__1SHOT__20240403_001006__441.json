This function uses list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words that start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\n[\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function works by checking the first character of each word in the list. If the first character is uppercase, the word is included in the new list. If not, it's excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[63,213],"elapsed":4.910725458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":441374139,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
