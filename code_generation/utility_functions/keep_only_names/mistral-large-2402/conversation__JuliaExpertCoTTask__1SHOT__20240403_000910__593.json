Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Create a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as an argument.\n   - Iterate over the list of words.\n   - Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n   - If it does, keep the word. If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(x -> isuppercase(x[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function `keep_only_names` does the task. It uses the `filter` function in Julia to keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis should output: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[194,280],"elapsed":6.6987595,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2018826879,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
