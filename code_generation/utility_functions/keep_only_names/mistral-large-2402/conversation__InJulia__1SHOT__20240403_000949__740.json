Here's a simple way to do it using list comprehension:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we're using a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase(first(word))` part checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is included in the new list. If not, it's excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[63,149],"elapsed":3.711737959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1652244794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
