If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\nHere's the Julia code for the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to iterate over the words in the list. The lambda function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list. If not, it is removed.\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` solves the task. It takes a list of words as input and returns a new list that only includes the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis should return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which are the only words in the list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[194,355],"elapsed":8.854708542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":491664441,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
