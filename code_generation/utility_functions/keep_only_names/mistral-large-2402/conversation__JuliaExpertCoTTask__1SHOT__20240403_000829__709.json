Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia to iterate over the words in the list. It keeps only those words where the first character is an uppercase letter, as determined by the `isuppercase` function.\n\nLet's test the function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```julia\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis shows that the function is working correctly, as it has removed \"banana\" and \"dog\" from the list, and kept \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\".","status":200,"tokens":[194,232],"elapsed":7.133550333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1284707635,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
