If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\nHere's a Julia function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia, which applies a given function to each element of the collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`. In this case, the function we're using is `isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of a word is uppercase.\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` solves the task. It takes a list of words and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis should return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which are the only words in the list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[194,353],"elapsed":8.098997917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-445520692,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
