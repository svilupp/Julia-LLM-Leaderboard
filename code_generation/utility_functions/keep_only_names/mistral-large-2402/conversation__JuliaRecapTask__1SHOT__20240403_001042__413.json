[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the provided list. It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` array.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\n[\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nAs per your guidelines, I've used Julia's standard libraries and avoided any new packages. I've also emphasized clarity in the code. The function is not too restrictive in its input, accepting any iterable of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[370,301],"elapsed":7.586713833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":922481042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
