Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Iterate over the list of words.\n   - For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter.\n   - If it does, keep it. If it doesn't, remove it.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` does this. It uses the `filter` function in Julia to create a new list that only contains the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis should output: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which are the only words in the list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[194,275],"elapsed":6.890009084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1773579468,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
