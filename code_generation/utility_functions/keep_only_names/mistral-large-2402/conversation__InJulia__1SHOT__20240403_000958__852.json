The lambda function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list. If not, it is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[63,130],"elapsed":3.294963458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-432802913,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
