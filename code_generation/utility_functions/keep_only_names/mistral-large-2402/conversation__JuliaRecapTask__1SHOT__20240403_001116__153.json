[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library, which applies a given function to each element of a collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`.\n\nIn this case, the function we're using is an anonymous function (`word -> isuppercase(word[1])`) that checks if the first character of a word is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept in the new collection; if not, it's discarded.\n\nLet's double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Horse\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Horse\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function should work as expected, and it follows the Julia language guidelines you provided. It uses standard library functions, an anonymous function, and 1-based indexing, and it's designed to be performant and clear.","status":200,"tokens":[370,289],"elapsed":6.685802708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1624536181,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
