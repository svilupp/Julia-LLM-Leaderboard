Define the function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Iterate over the list `words`.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Collect and return the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = [word for word in words if occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)]\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided example\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n- We use a list comprehension to create a new list `result` that includes only the words matching the regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"`.\n- The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches strings that start with a capital letter.\n- Finally, we return the `result`.\n\nLet's confirm that our solution is correct by running the test case.","status":200,"tokens":[173,229],"elapsed":2.428672292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-654908588,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
