[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task and write a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that will take a list of words and filter out all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task\n\n1. **Iterate Over Words:** Traverse through each word in the list.\n2. **Check Capitalization:** Verify if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. **Filter Words:** Construct a new list including only the words that start with a capital letter.\n4. **Return the Filtered List.**\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets\n\n1. **Iterating Over Arrays:**\n    ```julia\n    for word in words\n        # do something with word\n    end\n    ```\n\n2. **Checking First Character If It's Uppercase:**\n    ```julia\n    Base.capitalize(word[1]) == word[1]\n    ```\n\n3. **Filtering Arrays with Logical Conditions:**\n    ```julia\n    filter(word -> condition, words)\n    ```\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Definition:** We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`) and returns a filtered vector of strings.\n- **Filtering:** We use the `filter` function to create a new list that only includes words where the first character (`word[1]`) is uppercase.\n\n### Double-check the solution\n\nLet's make sure the implementation is correct with some test cases:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\"]))  # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]))       # Should return [\"Apple\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([]))                                 # Should return []\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"alllowercase\", \"NOCAPS\", \"MixEd\"])) # Should return [\"NOCAPS\", \"MixEd\"]\n```\n\nLet's finalize this into a self-contained example:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Test cases to verify the solution\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\"]))  # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]))       # Should return [\"Apple\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([]))                                 # Should return []\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"alllowercase\", \"NOCAPS\", \"MixEd\"])) # Should return [\"NOCAPS\", \"MixEd\"]\n```\n\nThis function should meet the requirements outlined in the task and will process the list of words as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[322,600],"elapsed":6.019883708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":492188207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
