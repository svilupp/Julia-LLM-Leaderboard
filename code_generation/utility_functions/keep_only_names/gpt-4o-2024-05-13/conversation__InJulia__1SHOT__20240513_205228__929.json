Below is the code for the function `keep_only_names` in Julia. This function takes a list of words and filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use the filter function to retain only words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a vector of strings.\n2. The `filter` function is used to process each word in the input list.\n3. For each word, the lambda function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the word is not empty and if the first character is an uppercase letter.\n4. If both conditions are true, the word is kept in the resulting list; otherwise, it is filtered out.\n5. The resulting filtered list is returned.\n\nYou can test the function with the example usage provided.","status":200,"tokens":[64,275],"elapsed":2.873495541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1831009534,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
