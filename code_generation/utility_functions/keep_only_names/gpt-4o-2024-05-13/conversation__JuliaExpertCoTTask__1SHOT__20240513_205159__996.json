When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's go through the steps to solve the task.\n\n## Plan\n1. Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words.\n2. Iterate over the words and check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n3. Retain words that start with a capital letter.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\n## Implementation\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if word[1].isuppercase()]\nend\n```\n\n## Example and Test\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])) # Output should be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nLet's implement and test it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if word[1].isuppercase()]\nend\n\n# Example test\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])) # Expected: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nLet's ensure the solution is correct:\n```julia\nassert(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) == [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"])\n```\n\nThis will complete the task. Let me know if you need any further modifications or tests.","status":200,"tokens":[173,291],"elapsed":2.936159667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-347249058,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
