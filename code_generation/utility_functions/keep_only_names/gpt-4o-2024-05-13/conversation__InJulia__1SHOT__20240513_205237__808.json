The `^` indicates the start of the string and `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.\n- The function `filter` is then used to keep only those elements in the list that satisfy this condition.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words to get the filtered results:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis will give you a list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,251],"elapsed":2.440209375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":419855221,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
