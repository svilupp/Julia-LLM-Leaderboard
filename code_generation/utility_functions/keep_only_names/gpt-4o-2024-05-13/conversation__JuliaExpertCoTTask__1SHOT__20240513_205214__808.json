Define a function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Iterate over the provided list of words.\n3. Check whether each word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Append the words that start with a capital letter to a new list.\n5. Return the new list.\n\nHere is how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    capitalized_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` accepts a vector of strings (`words`).\n- An empty list `capitalized_words` is created to store the valid words.\n- The for loop iterates through each word in the list.\n- The `occurin` function with the regex `r\"^[A-Z]\"` checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n- If the condition is true, the word is appended to `capitalized_words`.\n- Finally, the filtered list is returned. \n\n### Testing:\nYou can test the function with the provided example data to ensure accuracy.","status":200,"tokens":[173,286],"elapsed":3.33122675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1302488988,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
