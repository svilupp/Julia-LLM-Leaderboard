Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that filters out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\"), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n- `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` as its argument.\n- It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n- For each word, it checks if it starts with an uppercase letter using the `startswith` function with a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"`.\n- `startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")` returns `true` if the word starts with an uppercase letter (A-Z).\n- `filter` constructs a new array containing only the words that satisfy the condition and returns it.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Eagle\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Eagle\"]\n```\n\nFeel free to run this code in a Julia environment to see it in action!","status":200,"tokens":[64,273],"elapsed":2.825279083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":405348165,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
