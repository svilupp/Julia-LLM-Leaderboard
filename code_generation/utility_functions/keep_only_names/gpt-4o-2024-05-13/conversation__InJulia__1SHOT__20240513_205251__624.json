Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty array to store words that start with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the input list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            # Add the word to the capitalized_words array\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nHereâ€™s how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. We initialize an empty array `capitalized_words` to store words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each word in the provided list.\n4. We check if the word is not empty and if the first character is uppercase (`isuppercase(first(word))`).\n5. If the word meets the condition, it is added to the `capitalized_words` array using `push!`.\n6. Finally, we return the `capitalized_words` array.","status":200,"tokens":[64,317],"elapsed":3.319086083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":182921927,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
