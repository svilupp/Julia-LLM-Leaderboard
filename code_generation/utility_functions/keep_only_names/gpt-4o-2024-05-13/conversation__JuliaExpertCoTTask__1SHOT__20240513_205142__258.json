[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Approach\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of words as input.\n2. Iterate through the list of words.\n3. Use a condition to check if the first letter of each word is capitalized.\n4. Collect the words that pass the condition into a new list.\n5. Return the new list.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    result = [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Testing the Function\n\n```julia\n# Test case\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n### Full Code\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    result = [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test case\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nBy running this code, you will filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[173,257],"elapsed":2.521351083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-78742451,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
