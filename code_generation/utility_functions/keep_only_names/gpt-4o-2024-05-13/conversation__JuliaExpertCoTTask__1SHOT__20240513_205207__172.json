Let's go through the steps to accomplish this.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Iterate over the provided list `words`.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Collect words that start with a capital letter in a new list.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nHere's the code following the outlined steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a list `words` as an argument.\n- It uses a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` to check if a word starts with a capital letter.\n- If the condition is met, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list.\n- Finally, the function returns the filtered list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify the function with the provided list.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```plaintext\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function works correctly as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[173,388],"elapsed":3.644337667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1355815620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
