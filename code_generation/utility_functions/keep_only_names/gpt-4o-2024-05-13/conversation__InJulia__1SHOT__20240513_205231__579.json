The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the input list and applies a condition to check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n3. The condition is specified using the `startswith` function with a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"`, which matches strings that start with any uppercase letter from A to Z.\n4. The function returns a new list containing only the words that meet the condition.\n\nYou can easily call this function with any list of words to filter out those that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,263],"elapsed":3.231935208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1351521204,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
