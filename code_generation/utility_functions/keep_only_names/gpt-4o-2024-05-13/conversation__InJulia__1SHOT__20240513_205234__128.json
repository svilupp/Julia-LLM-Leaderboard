Below is an example of how you could write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use list comprehension to filter out words not starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: `keep_only_names` takes one argument `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n2. **List Comprehension**: `[word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]`:\n   - Iterates over each `word` in the `words` list.\n   - Checks if word is non-empty (`!isempty(word)`) and if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase (`isuppercase(word[1])`).\n   - Collects the words that pass these checks into a new list `filtered_words`.\n3. **Return**: The filtered list `filtered_words` is returned.\n\nThis function will ensure that only words starting with a capital letter are retained in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,314],"elapsed":3.5273135,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-623783109,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
