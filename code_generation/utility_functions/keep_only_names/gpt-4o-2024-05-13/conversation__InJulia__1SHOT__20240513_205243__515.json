This function iterates over a list of words and keeps only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words that start with a capital letter\n    capital_words = []\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(capital_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capital_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with an example list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n1. Initializing an empty array to store words that start with a capital letter.\n2. Iterating over each word in the input list.\n3. Checking if the word is not empty and if its first character is an uppercase letter.\n4. Adding the word to the result list if the condition is met.\n5. Returning the list of words that meet the criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[64,273],"elapsed":2.630783542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1111486494,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
