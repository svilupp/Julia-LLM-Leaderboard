[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To fulfill the task, you want to define a function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and filters out those that do not start with a capital letter. Here’s a systematic approach to solve the problem using Julia:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings as input.\n2. **Filter Words**: Use a filtering mechanism to check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n3. **Return Result**: Return the filtered list.\n\nIn Julia, you can use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a word is uppercase. Together with list comprehensions or the `filter` function, you can achieve the desired result concisely.\n\nHere’s the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Define the function\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Zebra\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output should be [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}`: This defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a `Vector` of `AbstractString` and returns a `Vector` of `AbstractString`.\n\n2. **Filtering Logic**:\n   - `filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)`: This uses the `filter` function with an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n     - `word[1]` gets the first character of the word.\n     - `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if this character is uppercase.\n   \n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - This demonstrates how to use the `keep_only_names` function and prints the filtered list of words.\n\n### Double-checking the Solution:\n\n1. **Test with Empty List**:\n   ```julia\n   println(keep_only_names([]))  # Expected output: []\n   ```\n2. **Test with No Matching Words**:\n   ```julia\n   println(keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"cat\", \"banana\"]))  # Expected output: []\n   ```\n3. **Test with All Matching Words**:\n   ```julia\n   println(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Banana\"]))  # Expected output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Banana\"]\n   ```\n4. **Test with Mixed Case Words**:\n   ```julia\n   println(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Zebra\"]))  # Expected output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Zebra\"]\n   ```\n\nBy performing these checks, we can confirm that the function behaves as expected.
