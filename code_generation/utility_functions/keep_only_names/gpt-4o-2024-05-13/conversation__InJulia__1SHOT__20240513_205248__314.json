Here's a function in Julia that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the words to only include those that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nHere's how this function works:\n- It takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n- It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word and include only the words that start with a capital letter.\n- The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase.\n- Finally, it returns a new vector containing only the filtered words.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nThis function ensures that only words starting with a capital letter are retained in the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,230],"elapsed":2.631133166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1936590502,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
