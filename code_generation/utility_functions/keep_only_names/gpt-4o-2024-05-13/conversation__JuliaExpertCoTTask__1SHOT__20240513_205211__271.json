Iterates over the given list of words.\n2. Checks if each word starts with a capital letter.\n3. Maintains words that start with a capital letter and removes the others.\n\nWe will utilize Julia's in-built string manipulation functions to complete the task.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Iterate through the list of words.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Collect and return the words that meet the condition.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = filter(word -> word[1] in 'A':'Z', words)\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nLet's explain the steps in the code:\n\n- We define the function `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of strings (`words`) and returns a list of strings.\n- We use the `filter` function to iterate over each word and apply a condition (`word[1] in 'A':'Z'`), which checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter.\n- The filtered list of words is returned.\n\nNow let's verify it's working with the provided data.\n\nKeep in mind that our function assumes the input data is a list of non-empty strings. In practice, it may be necessary to add additional checks for empty strings or other edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[173,344],"elapsed":3.246666042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":549429106,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
