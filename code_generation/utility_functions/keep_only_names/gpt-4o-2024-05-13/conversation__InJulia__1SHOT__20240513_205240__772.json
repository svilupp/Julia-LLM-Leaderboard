In Julia, you can implement the function `keep_only_names` as described. Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(w -> !isempty(w) && isuppercase(first(w)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}`: This defines a function named `keep_only_names` which takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a vector of strings.\n2. `filter(w -> !isempty(w) && isuppercase(first(w)), words)`: This line uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word `w` in the list `words` and apply a condition to keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n   - `w -> !isempty(w) && isuppercase(first(w))` is an anonymous function (lambda function) that checks if the word is not empty `!isempty(w)` and if the first character of the word is uppercase `isuppercase(first(w))`.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nThis will remove words that do not start with a capital letter and retain those that do.","status":200,"tokens":[64,308],"elapsed":2.934742584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1199951528,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
