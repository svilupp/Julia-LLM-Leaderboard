The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words and filters out those that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function and an anonymous function (`word -> isuppercase(word[1])`) to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. It keeps only the words that meet this criterion. Here's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over the list and produce a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,202],"elapsed":2.340162125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":697533177,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
