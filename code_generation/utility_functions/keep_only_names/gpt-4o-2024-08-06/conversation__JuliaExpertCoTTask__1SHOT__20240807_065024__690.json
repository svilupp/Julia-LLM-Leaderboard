Define the function `keep_only_names` that accepts a list `words`.\n2. Iterate over each word in the list.\n3. Check if the first character of each word is a capital letter.\n4. Use a list comprehension to create a new list with words that start with a capital letter.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter words that start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")]\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")` uses a regular expression to check if the word starts with an uppercase letter.\n- The list comprehension filters and constructs a new list satisfying the condition.\n\n### Checking the solution:\n- The function is tested with `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]` and correctly outputs `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[173,276],"elapsed":4.020087125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-711099210,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
