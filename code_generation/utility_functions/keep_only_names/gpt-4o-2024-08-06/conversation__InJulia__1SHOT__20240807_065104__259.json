In Julia, you can achieve this by defining a function that filters out words not starting with a capital letter. Here’s how you can write the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how this function works:\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a single argument `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n- The `filter` function is used to create a new vector containing only the elements of `words` that meet a specified condition.\n- The anonymous function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])` is used as the condition. This checks that:\n  - The word is not empty (`!isempty(word)`) to handle any potential empty strings in the list safely.\n  - The first character `word[1]` is uppercase, using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nYou can use this function with a list of words to keep only those that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"tiger\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently filters the list to retain only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,303],"elapsed":3.581965416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1418457400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
