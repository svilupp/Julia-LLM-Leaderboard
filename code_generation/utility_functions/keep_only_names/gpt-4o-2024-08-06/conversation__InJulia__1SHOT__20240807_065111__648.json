In Julia, you can define the function `keep_only_names` to filter out words that don't start with a capital letter. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a comprehension to filter words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"tiger\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of `words` as input.\n- It uses a comprehension to iterate over each word and applies the `startswith` function with a regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter ([A-Z]).\n- Only the words that satisfy this condition are kept in the resulting list.\n- Finally, the function returns a new list with only the words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,233],"elapsed":3.139522958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1277320967,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
