[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, we need to implement a function `keep_only_names` that filters words in a given list, keeping only those that start with a capital letter.\n\n## Steps to Solve the Task\n\n1. **Recall Useful Snippets**: \n   - Use list comprehension or higher-order functions like `filter` for concise operations.\n   - Use `first(x)` to get the first character of a string.\n   - Use the `isupper` function to check if a character is uppercase.\n\n2. **Implement the Solution**:\n   - Use a filtering mechanism to iterate over each word.\n   - Check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n   - Return a list with the filtered words.\n\nHere is the complete solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- **`filter(word -> condition, words)`**: Filters the list `words` by applying the condition to each element.\n- **`!isempty(word)`**: Ensures that the word is not empty before checking the first character.\n- **`isuppercase(first(word))`**: Checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\n## Double-check Solution\n\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Verify the handling of empty words, which are filtered out by `!isempty(word)`.\n   - Check an empty list as input and the capitalization of single-character strings.\n   \n2. **Example Testing**:\n   - With `[\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Alice\", \"bob\"]`, it should return `[\"Dog\", \"Alice\"]`.\n   - With `[\"Tree\", \"\", \"Apple\"]`, it should return `[\"Tree\", \"Apple\"]`.\n\nThis function is efficient, clear, and leverages Julia's strengths in functional programming and string manipulation.","status":200,"tokens":[322,396],"elapsed":4.291044167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2004707562,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
