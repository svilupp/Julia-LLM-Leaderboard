In Julia, you can create a function `keep_only_names` that filters out words not starting with a capital letter using list comprehension and the `isuppercase` function. Here's an implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this function works:\n\n- `words::Vector{String}` specifies that the input `words` should be a vector of strings.\n- `isempty(word)` ensures that the word is not empty before accessing the first character to prevent indexing errors.\n- `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n- The list comprehension `[word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]` builds a new list containing only the words that meet the criteria.\n\nYou can test the function with various lists of words like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\", \"Antelope\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Antelope\"]\n```\n\nThis function effectively filters the list to retain only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,271],"elapsed":3.686423208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1885568307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
