[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the problem, we'll create a function named `keep_only_names` in Julia, which will iterate over a given list of words and filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. Here's a step-by-step approach to crafting the function:\n\n## Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings `words` as an input.\n2. **Filter Logic**: Utilize a comprehension or a filter to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. In Julia, we can use the function `isuppercase` along with indexing to achieve this.\n3. **Output**: Return a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n\n- Check if a character is uppercase using `isuppercase(c)`.\n- Access the first character of a word with `word[1]`.\n- Filter or list comprehension to create a new array based on a condition.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` is defined to accept a vector of strings (`Vector{AbstractString}`).\n- We use a comprehension to iterate over each `word` in `words`.\n- For each `word`, we first ensure it is not empty using `!isempty(word)` (to prevent errors when accessing `word[1]`).\n- We check if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n- These conditions filter the array, keeping only words that start with an uppercase letter.\n\n### Double-checking Solution:\n\n- Ensure that the function correctly processes an empty list `[]` by returning an empty list.\n- Verify its behavior with various input cases, such as lists with empty strings, and strings having numeric or special characters.\n- Validate with edge cases where words are capitalized due to non-letter starting characters (should not satisfy uppercase condition).\n  \nThis function is now ready for use in the desired context.","status":200,"tokens":[321,454],"elapsed":5.70922825,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1962863384,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
