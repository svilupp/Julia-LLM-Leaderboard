The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input.\n2. We initialize an empty list `capitalized_words` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each word in the input list. \n4. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter using a regular expression that matches uppercase letters (`[A-Z]`).\n5. If a word starts with a capital letter, we append it to `capitalized_words`.\n6. Finally, the function returns the list of capitalized words.\n\n### Checking the Solution\n- The result of `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])` should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.\n- Verify that only words with initial capital letters are kept in the final list.","status":200,"tokens":[173,309],"elapsed":3.254335833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1955695184,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
