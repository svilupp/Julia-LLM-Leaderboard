The `first` function is used to get the first character, and `isuppercase` checks if it is uppercase. The `!isempty(word)` guard ensures that empty strings do not cause errors.","status":200,"tokens":[97,115],"elapsed":1.745669334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-149526535,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
