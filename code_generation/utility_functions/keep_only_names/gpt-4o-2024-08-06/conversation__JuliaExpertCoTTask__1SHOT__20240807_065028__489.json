This can be done with the `isuppercase` function in Julia.\n\n3. **Filtering Logic:**\n   - If the word starts with a capital letter, retain it in the resulting list. \n\n4. **Return the Filtered List:**\n   - Return the new list from the function, which consists only of words starting with a capital letter.\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   - Check the solution with the provided example to ensure the function behaves as expected.\n\n## Implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the Task with the Provided Data:\n\n```julia\n# Data\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\n\n# Function Call\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\n## Let's check:\n\nThe function call `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])` should return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[173,283],"elapsed":3.798731792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1398511993,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
