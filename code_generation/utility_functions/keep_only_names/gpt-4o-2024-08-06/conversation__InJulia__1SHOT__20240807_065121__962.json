Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that filters a given list of words, retaining only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use the `filter` function to keep only words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `filter` function, which processes each word in the `words` list to check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase`. Here's how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nmy_words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(my_words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will retain only the words \"Dog\", \"Elephant\", and \"Zebra\" in the resulting list, as they start with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[64,219],"elapsed":2.510421875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1318929300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
