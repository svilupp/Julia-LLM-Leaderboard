In Julia, you can write a function `keep_only_names` that filters out words not starting with a capital letter using list comprehension or the `filter` function. Hereâ€™s an example implementation using list comprehension:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `filter` function for a similar effect:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nBoth versions of the function iterate over the list `words`, checking if the first character of each word is uppercase. If the word starts with a capital letter, it is retained in the resulting list. Note that we also take care of empty strings by checking `!isempty(word)`, which ensures words that could cause errors (like out-of-bounds errors when accessing `first(word)`) are not processed.","status":200,"tokens":[64,223],"elapsed":2.295686625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1359145170,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
