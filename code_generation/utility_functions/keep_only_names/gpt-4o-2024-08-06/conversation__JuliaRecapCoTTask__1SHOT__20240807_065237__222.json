[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, we will follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets\n- We can iterate over an array using a `for` loop.\n- We can use the `filter` function which returns a subset of elements from an array based on a given condition.\n- To check if a string starts with a capital letter, we can use `isuppercase` in conjunction with `first`.\n\n### Solve the Task\nWe will create a function `keep_only_names` that uses the `filter` function to extract only those words which start with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check the Solution\n- **Type Constraints**: The input and output use the `Vector{AbstractString}` because it offers flexibility, allowing any subtype of `AbstractString`.\n- **Correctness**: We use `first` to get the first character and `isuppercase` to check if it is a capital letter, ensuring that words starting with a capital letter are kept.\n\nHere's a quick test to verify the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Expected output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis solution should correctly and efficiently filter out non-capitalized words from the input list.","status":200,"tokens":[322,300],"elapsed":3.797877458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1345692063,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
