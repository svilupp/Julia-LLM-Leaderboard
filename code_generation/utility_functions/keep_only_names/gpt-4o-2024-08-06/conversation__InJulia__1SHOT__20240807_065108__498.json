Hereâ€™s a sample implementation using a comprehension:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"[A-Z]\")]\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n- Takes a vector of strings, `words`, as an argument.\n- Uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `word` in `words`.\n- Checks if a word starts with a capital letter using the `startswith(word, r\"[A-Z]\")` condition, which checks if the first character is between 'A' and 'Z'.\n- Collects and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Elephant\"]\n``` \n\nThis function effectively filters out any words that do not start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,268],"elapsed":4.415676542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1919461394,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
