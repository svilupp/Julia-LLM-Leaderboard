Here's a simple implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]) && isascii(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`!isempty(word)`:** This checks if the word is not empty, preventing any index out of bounds errors when accessing the first character.\n- **`isuppercase(word[1])`:** This checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n- **`isascii(word[1])`:** This ensures the first character is an ASCII character, which helps in distinguishing between regular capital letters and other non-ASCII characters that might not be valid names.\n\nYou can then use this function by passing a list of words to it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis function will retain only those words in the list that start with a capital letter, effectively filtering out words like \"cat\" and \"elephant\" from the example.","status":200,"tokens":[64,296],"elapsed":3.655148,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":647467740,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
