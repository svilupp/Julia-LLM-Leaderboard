[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll create a function `keep_only_names` that filters words from a given list. This function will retain only those words that start with a capital letter. Let's systematically build this solution while adhering to good Julia practices.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We'll define a function `keep_only_names` which takes an array of strings as input. \n2. **Iterate and Filter**: Use the `filter` function to iterate over the list and keep only those words that start with a capital letter.\n3. **Condition for Filtering**: To check if a word starts with a capital letter, we'll use Julia's built-in `isuppercase` function on the first character of each word.\n4. **Return Value**: The function will return a new array with words starting with a capital letter.\n\n### Julia Snippets to Utilize:\n- `filter` function to iterate and conditionally select elements.\n- Access the first character of a string with `s[1]`.\n- Use `isuppercase` to check if a character is uppercase.\n\nLet's implement these steps in the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Signature**: \n  - `words::Vector{AbstractString}` specifies that `words` should be a vector of strings.\n  - The return type `::Vector{AbstractString}` indicates the function returns a vector of strings.\n  \n- **`filter`**: \n  - It applies the given condition `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` to each element in `words`.\n  - This lambda function checks if the first character of each word is uppercase, ensuring only names (or words starting with a capital letter) are kept.\n\n### Double-Check the Solution:\n- We'll make sure that this function works correctly by imagining a list of test cases:\n  - `[\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Lion\", \"tiger\"]` should return `[\"Dog\", \"Lion\"]`.\n  - `[\"Elephant\", \"wolf\", \"Bear\", \"shark\"]` should return `[\"Elephant\", \"Bear\"]`.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and clear, leveraging Julia's powerful string and array handling capabilities while maintaining adherence to best practices.","status":200,"tokens":[321,488],"elapsed":6.538341458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2057576582,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
