We can utilize Julia's string manipulation capabilities to check the first character of each word. Here's how you can implement the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use the filter function to select words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Function Definition**: We defined a function `keep_only_names` which takes a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`) and returns another vector of strings.\n  \n- **Filtering with `filter`**: We use the `filter` function, which takes a predicate (a function that returns true or false) and a collection. It returns a collection containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate condition.\n\n- **Predicate Function**: The predicate function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])` ensures:\n  - `!isempty(word)`: The word is not empty to avoid indexing errors.\n  - `isuppercase(word[1])`: The first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n\n### Usage example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"tiger\", \"Lion\", \"\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently filters and keeps only those words that start with an uppercase letter, as required.","status":200,"tokens":[64,357],"elapsed":3.293192875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-547849436,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
