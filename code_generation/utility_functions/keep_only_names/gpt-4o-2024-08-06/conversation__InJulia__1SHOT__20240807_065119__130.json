A word starts with a capital letter if its first character is an uppercase letter, which we can check using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nHere's how the function can be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use the filter function to keep only words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes one argument, `words`, which is expected to be a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`).\n- Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n- The filter function uses an anonymous function `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))` to determine if a word should be kept:\n  - `!isempty(word)` ensures that we are not trying to access the first character of an empty word.\n  - `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n- This filtered list is returned as the output of the function.\n\nHereâ€™s an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Alice\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output should be [\"Dog\", \"Alice\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis example keeps only the words \"Dog\", \"Alice\", and \"Elephant\" because they start with a capital letter. The words \"cat\" and \"bird\" are excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[64,374],"elapsed":3.872346125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-150152403,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
