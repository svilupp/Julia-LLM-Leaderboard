Define the function `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of words.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list.\n3. Check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n4. Create a new list that only includes words starting with a capital letter.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, r\"^[A-Z]\")]\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n## Test the Solution\n\nThis function filters the words and retains only those with an initial capital letter.\n\n### Expected Output\nFor the example data `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, the expected output is `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.\n\nBy running the provided example, it should print:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[173,214],"elapsed":2.037576125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-785323514,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
