Define a function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Iterate over the list `words`.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter using the `isuppercase` function on the first letter.\n4. Collect only those words that satisfy the condition.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a comprehension to filter the words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nNow, let's check if the solution is correct:\n\n- \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" start with uppercase letters, so they should be kept.\n- \"banana\" and \"dog\" do not, so they should be removed.\n\nThe output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which confirms the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[173,210],"elapsed":3.238107625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1917994310,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
