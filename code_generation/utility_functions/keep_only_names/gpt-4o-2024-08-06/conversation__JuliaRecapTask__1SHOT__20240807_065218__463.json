[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function named `keep_only_names` that takes one argument, `words`, which is a list of strings.\n\n2. **Iterate and Filter**: Use a comprehension to iterate through the list and filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. In Julia, strings can be checked for capitalization using the condition that the first character is uppercase.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: Return a new list containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Julia Snippets Useful for this Task:\n\n- **List comprehension**:\n  ```julia\n  [x for x in iterable if condition]\n  ```\n\n- **Character Checking**:\n  Use Julia's `isuppercase` function to check if a character is uppercase:\n  ```julia\n  isuppercase('A')  # true\n  ```\n\n- **String Indexing**: Remember to use 1-based indexing:\n  ```julia\n  word[1]\n  ```\n\n### Implementation:\n\nNow, let's implement the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We define a function `keep_only_names` with `words` as a parameter, which is expected to be a vector of strings.\n- We iterate over each `word` in `words` using a list comprehension and apply a condition `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- The condition checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n- The words that satisfy this condition are collected into a new list, which is then returned by the function.\n\n### Double-check:\n\n- **Correctness**: Verified that the character check uses `isuppercase` and accounts for 1-based indexing in Julia.\n- **Efficiency**: List comprehension provides a concise and efficient way to filter the list.\n- **Clarity**: The solution is straightforward and readable.\n\nThis solution should meet the requirements specified in the task.
