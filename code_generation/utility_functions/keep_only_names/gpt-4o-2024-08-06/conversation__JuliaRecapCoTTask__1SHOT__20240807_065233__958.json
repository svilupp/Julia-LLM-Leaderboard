[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need a function that filters out words that do not start with a capital letter. Here's a systematic approach to creating such a function in Julia:\n\n### Steps to Solve the Task\n\n1. **Iterate Over Words**: We'll iterate over each word in the list `words`.\n2. **Check Capitalization**: For each word, we need to check if the first character is a capital letter.\n3. **Use String Operations**: We can use `isuppercase` function on the first character to verify if it is uppercase.\n4. **Filter Words**: Keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets\n\n- **String Indexing**: Access the first character of a string with `word[1]`.\n- **Checking Uppercase**: Use the `isuppercase` function to check if a character is uppercase.\n- **Array Comprehension**: Easily filter elements using `[word for word in words if condition]`.\n\n### Julia Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Definition**: `keep_only_names` accepts a vector of strings.\n- **Array Comprehension**: We iterate over `words`, checking if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase with `isuppercase`.\n- **Filtering**: Only words that meet the condition remain in the output list.\n\n### Final Steps\n\n- **Double-Check**: Verify the function behavior with some test cases to ensure it works correctly.\n- **Edge Cases**: Consider cases like empty strings or words with non-alphabet characters. The solution assumes valid input as per the task description.\n\nThis is an efficient and straightforward way to filter words based on capitalization in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[322,380],"elapsed":4.939284791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-245102688,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
