The predicate checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter using `isuppercase` and that the word is not empty. Only words that satisfy this condition are included in the resulting filtered array.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis will output the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[109,215],"elapsed":30.245039917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1757858943,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
