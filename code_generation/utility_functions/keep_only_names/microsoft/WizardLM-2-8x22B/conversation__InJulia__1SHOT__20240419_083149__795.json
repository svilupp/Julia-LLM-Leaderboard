Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Mouse\", \"fish\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nIn this function, `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase. The list comprehension iterates over each word in the input list and includes it in the output list if it starts with an uppercase letter. Words that do not meet this criterion are excluded from the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[68,238],"elapsed":28.609710083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1755743192,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
