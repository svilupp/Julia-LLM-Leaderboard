[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- To check if a word starts with a capital letter, we can use the `startswith` function combined with a regular expression.\n- To filter an array, we can use list comprehension or the `filter` function.\n- To create a regular expression in Julia, we use the `r\"...\"` syntax.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Regular expression to match words starting with a capital letter\n    capitalized = r\"^[A-Z]\"\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> startswith(word, capitalized), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes an array of strings `words`.\n- It defines a regular expression `capitalized` that matches any string that starts with an uppercase letter.\n- The `filter` function is used to iterate over each word in `words` and apply the lambda function `word -> startswith(word, capitalized)` which returns `true` if the word starts with a capital letter and `false` otherwise.\n- The `filter` function returns a new array containing only the words that satisfy the condition (i.e., start with a capital letter).\n- The function then returns this filtered array.\n\nThe solution should work correctly for the given task. Let's test it with an example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"julia\", \"Julia\", \"language\", \"Language\", \"programming\", \"Programming\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n@show filtered_words  # Should display [\"Julia\", \"Language\", \"Programming\"]\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\nfiltered_words = [\"Julia\", \"Language\", \"Programming\"]\n```\n\nThe function successfully filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[377,479],"elapsed":61.397776041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1501688009,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
