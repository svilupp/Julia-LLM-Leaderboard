[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Understood. Here's the function that adheres to the problem statement and the special instructions (if any):\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n   - `filter(predicate, collection)` to filter a collection based on a predicate function.\n   - `isuppercase(c)` to check if a character is uppercase.\n   - `first(s)` to get the first character of a string.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n   - The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n   - It uses the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` and keep only the words where the first character is uppercase, using the predicate function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`.\n   - The filtered list of words is then returned.\n\n3. Double-check the solution:\n   - The function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter, preserving only the \"names\" (words starting with a capital letter).\n   - It is a concise and efficient implementation using standard Julia functions.","status":200,"tokens":[350,285],"elapsed":2.988511834,"cost":0.00044375,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1425,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
