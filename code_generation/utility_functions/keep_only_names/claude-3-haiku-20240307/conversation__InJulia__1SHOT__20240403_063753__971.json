The `filter` function is used to create a new list containing only the elements from the original list `words` that satisfy a given condition.\n2. The condition is specified as a lambda function `word -> first(word) == uppercase(first(word))`. This checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase.\n3. The `first(word)` function returns the first character of the word, and `uppercase(first(word))` converts it to uppercase.\n4. The `==` operator compares the first character of the word to its uppercase version, and only keeps the word if they are the same (i.e., the first character is uppercase).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]`, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Cat\", \"Apple\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,325],"elapsed":3.709295666,"cost":0.00042175000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30750,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
