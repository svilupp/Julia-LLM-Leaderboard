The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It creates a new empty array called `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The function then iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n4. For each word, it checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isupper()` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the `names` array using the `push!()` function.\n6. Finally, the function returns the `names` array, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use the `keep_only_names` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"tree\", \"Apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"tree\", \"Apple\"]`, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Apple\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,430],"elapsed":3.846189084,"cost":0.000553,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3477,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
