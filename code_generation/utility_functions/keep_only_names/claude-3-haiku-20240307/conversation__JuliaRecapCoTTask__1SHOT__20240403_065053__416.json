[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from the provided list that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThe function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the elements that satisfy the condition `isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))`. This condition checks that the first character of the word is a letter and that it is an uppercase letter.\n\nThe function is designed to be generic and can handle any `Vector{<:AbstractString}` input, including `Vector{String}` or `Vector{SubString{String}}`.\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, I will prioritize them over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[350,232],"elapsed":2.86306575,"cost":0.0003775,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28725,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
