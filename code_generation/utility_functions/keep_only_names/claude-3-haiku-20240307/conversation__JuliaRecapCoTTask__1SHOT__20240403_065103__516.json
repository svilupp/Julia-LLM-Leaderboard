[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's a function that solves the problem according to the task description:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Recall that we can use a list comprehension to filter the list of words.\n2. The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. This will keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"apple\", \"Bird\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis solution follows the general guidelines for Julia programming:\n\n- It uses standard library functions like `isuppercase` and list comprehension, which are idiomatic Julia.\n- It uses type-stable and performant operations without introducing new packages.\n- The function signature is general, accepting a vector of `AbstractString` elements.\n- The function name and implementation are clear and concise.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any special instructions or if you would like me to modify the solution in any way.","status":200,"tokens":[350,298],"elapsed":3.419081334,"cost":0.00046000000000000007,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18975,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
