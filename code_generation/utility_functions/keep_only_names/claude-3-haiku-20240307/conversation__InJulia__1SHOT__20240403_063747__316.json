The function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the words that do not start with a lowercase letter.\n3. The `islowercase(first(word))` expression checks if the first character of the word is lowercase. The `!` operator negates the result, so that we keep the words where the first character is not lowercase.\n4. The filtered words are returned as a new vector.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"house\", \"Tree\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Tree\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the vector `[\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"house\", \"Tree\"]`, and it returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Tree\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,307],"elapsed":3.49096975,"cost":0.00039925000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14842,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
