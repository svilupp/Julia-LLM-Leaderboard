[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. The function signature `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})` specifies that the input `words` is a vector of strings (or any subtype of `AbstractString`).\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n   - The `isupper(first(word))` expression checks if the first character of the current `word` is uppercase.\n   - The `filter` function applies this condition to each element in the `words` vector and returns a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n\nThis solution is efficient, clear, and adheres to the best practices of the Julia language:\n\n- It uses the standard library function `filter` instead of a custom loop, making the code more concise and readable.\n- It uses a generic type annotation `<:AbstractString` to allow the function to work with any subtype of `AbstractString`, making it more flexible.\n- It avoids creating any unnecessary intermediate data structures, focusing on performance.\n\nYou can test the function with the following example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"dog\", \"BUILDING\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"BUILDING\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly removes the words that do not start with a capital letter and returns a new vector with only the \"name-like\" words.","status":200,"tokens":[349,400],"elapsed":4.83648525,"cost":0.00058725,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20151,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
