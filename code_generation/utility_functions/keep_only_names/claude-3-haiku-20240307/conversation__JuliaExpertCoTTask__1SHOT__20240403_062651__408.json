For each word, it checks if the first character is a letter (`isletter(word[1])`) and if it is uppercase (`isupper(word[1])`). If both conditions are true, the word is added to the `result` list using `push!`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe solution is checked by calling the `keep_only_names` function with the provided example data, and the expected output is produced.","status":200,"tokens":[181,397],"elapsed":4.080297084,"cost":0.0005415000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13165,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
