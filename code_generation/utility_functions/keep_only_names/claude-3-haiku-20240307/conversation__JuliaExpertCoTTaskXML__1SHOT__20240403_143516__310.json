The `isletter` and `isupper` functions are used to check if the first character of each word is a letter and is uppercase, respectively.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n# Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly removes the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" and returns only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[215,243],"elapsed":2.66352025,"cost":0.0003575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1192,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
