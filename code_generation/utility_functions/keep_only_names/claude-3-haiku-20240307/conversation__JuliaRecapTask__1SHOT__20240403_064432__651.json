[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `keep_only_names` takes an `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` as its argument, which means it can accept any array-like collection of strings.\n2. The `filter` function is used to create a new array, where each element satisfies the condition specified in the anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`.\n3. The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. This effectively filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n4. The resulting filtered array is then returned as the output of the `keep_only_names` function.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"HOUSE\", \"apple\", \"Book\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"HOUSE\", \"Book\"]\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes the array `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"HOUSE\", \"apple\", \"Book\"]` and returns a new array `[\"Cat\", \"HOUSE\", \"Book\"]` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[349,345],"elapsed":3.775774625,"cost":0.0005185000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11355,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
