Use `filter` to iterate over the list of words.\n2. For each word, check if the first character is a letter (`isletter(first(word))`) and if it is uppercase (`isupper(first(word))`).\n3. Only keep the words that pass this check.\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\nThis should return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which is the correct solution.","status":200,"tokens":[215,264],"elapsed":2.9768305,"cost":0.00038375000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29840,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
