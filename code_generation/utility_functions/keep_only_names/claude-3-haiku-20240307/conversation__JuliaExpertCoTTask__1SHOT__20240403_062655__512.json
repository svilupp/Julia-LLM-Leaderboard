We can do this by checking the first character of each word and only keeping the words where the first character is uppercase.\n\n2. **Write the code**: We use the `filter()` function to iterate over the `words` list and keep only the words where the first character is a letter and is uppercase.\n\n3. **Solve the task**: We return the filtered list of capitalized words.\n\n4. **Check the solution**: The output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.\n\nThe `isletter()` function checks if the first character of the word is a letter, and the `isupper()` function checks if the first character is uppercase. These functions are used together to filter the list and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[181,370],"elapsed":3.645075541,"cost":0.0005077500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15737,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
