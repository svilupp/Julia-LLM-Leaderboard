[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `keep_only_names` that follows the given task and special instructions:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` list and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The condition `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. This is used as the filter criteria.\n4. The filtered list of words is then returned.\n\nThis solution is efficient, clear, and uses only standard Julia functions without any additional packages. It adheres to the provided special instructions and guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[350,192],"elapsed":2.5748075,"cost":0.00032750000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
