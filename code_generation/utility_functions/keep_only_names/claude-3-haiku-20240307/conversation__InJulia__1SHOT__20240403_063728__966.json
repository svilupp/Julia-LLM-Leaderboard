The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to create a new list that contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The condition `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` checks if the first character of each word matches the regular expression `^[A-Z]`, which represents a capital letter at the beginning of the string.\n4. The filtered list of words is returned as the output.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"ball\", \"John\", \"apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"John\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list of words `[\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"ball\", \"John\", \"apple\"]`, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Dog\", \"House\", \"John\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,313],"elapsed":3.049210083,"cost":0.00040675000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4330,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
