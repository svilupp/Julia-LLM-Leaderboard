The `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input.\n2. We initialize an empty list `filtered_words` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over the `words` list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each word, we check if the first character is a letter (`isletter(word[1])`) and if it is uppercase (`isupper(word[1])`).\n5. If the condition is true, we add the word to the `filtered_words` list using `push!`.\n6. Finally, we return the `filtered_words` list.\n7. We test the function with the given data and assert that the result is as expected.\n\nThe function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter from the input list.","status":200,"tokens":[181,377],"elapsed":3.675666709,"cost":0.0005165,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6498,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
