[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from the provided `words` list that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> first(word) == uppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a `Vector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept a list of strings or any subtype of `AbstractString`.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` list and keep only the words that satisfy the condition `first(word) == uppercase(first(word))`. This condition checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n3. The filtered list of words is then returned as the output.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with a list of words, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[349,293],"elapsed":2.93918725,"cost":0.0004535,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31568,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
