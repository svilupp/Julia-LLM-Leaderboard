The condition `isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))` checks that the first character of the word is a letter and is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[215,223],"elapsed":2.229215292,"cost":0.0003325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14668,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
