The `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input.\n2. We use the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and keep only the words that start with a capital letter. The condition `isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is a letter and if it is uppercase.\n3. The filtered list of words is returned as the output.\n4. We test the function with the provided example data to ensure that it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[181,294],"elapsed":2.919730875,"cost":0.00041275000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1295,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
