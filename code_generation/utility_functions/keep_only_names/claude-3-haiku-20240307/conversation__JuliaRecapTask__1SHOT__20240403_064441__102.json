[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    names = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the words where the first character is uppercase.\n3. The `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. The filtered words are returned as a new vector of strings.\n\nThis solution follows the general guidelines for Julia programming:\n\n- It uses the standard library function `filter` to perform the filtering operation, which is efficient and concise.\n- It uses the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, which is a clear and straightforward way to implement the desired logic.\n- It returns a new vector of strings, which is the expected output of the function.\n\nThe solution is general and can handle any vector of strings, without making any assumptions about the specific content or structure of the input.","status":200,"tokens":[349,274],"elapsed":3.096220375,"cost":0.00042975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28451,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
