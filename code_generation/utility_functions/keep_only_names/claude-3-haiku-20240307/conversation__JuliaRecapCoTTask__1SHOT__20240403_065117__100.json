[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from the provided list that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> first(word) == uppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes an `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept any vector-like collection of strings.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only those words where the first character is equal to the uppercase version of the first character.\n3. The `first(word)` expression gets the first character of each word, and the `uppercase(first(word))` converts it to uppercase. We compare these two values to check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n4. The `filter` function returns a new vector containing only the words that pass the condition, which is then returned by the `keep_only_names` function.\n\nThis solution adheres to the provided guidelines:\n\n- It uses the standard Julia library functions `filter` and `uppercase` without introducing any new packages.\n- The type annotation `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` is general enough to accept a wide range of vector-like collections of strings, without being too restrictive.\n- The function is focused on performance, clarity, and abstraction, using a single, concise expression to implement the required logic.\n\nIf you have any special instructions, please provide them, and I'll adapt the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[350,362],"elapsed":4.2958975,"cost":0.00054,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5305,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
