Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Use the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words.\n3. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(w))`. This returns `true` if the first character is uppercase, and `false` otherwise.\n4. Only keep the words where the first character is uppercase.\n5. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nLet's test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly removes the words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[215,278],"elapsed":2.728712042,"cost":0.00040125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9240,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
