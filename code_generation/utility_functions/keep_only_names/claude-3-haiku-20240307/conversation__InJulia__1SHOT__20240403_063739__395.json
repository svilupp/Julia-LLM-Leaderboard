The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list called `filtered_words` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The function then iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n4. For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list using the `push!()` function.\n6. After iterating through all the words, the function returns the `filtered_words` list, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Book\", \"apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Book\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names()` is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Book\", \"apple\"]`, and it returns a new list `[\"Cat\", \"Book\"]` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,370],"elapsed":3.41204975,"cost":0.000478,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5499,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
