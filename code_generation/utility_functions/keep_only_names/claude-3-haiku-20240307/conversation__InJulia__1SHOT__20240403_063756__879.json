The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the list of words and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The condition `isupper(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. This is used to filter out the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n4. The filtered list of words is returned as the output of the function.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Apple\", \"bird\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Apple\", \"bird\"]`, and it returns the list `[\"Cat\", \"Apple\"]`, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,281],"elapsed":3.345981333,"cost":0.00036675000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24250,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
