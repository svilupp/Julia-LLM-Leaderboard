[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `keep_only_names` that solves the given task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes a `Vector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept any vector of strings.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the elements that satisfy the condition specified in the anonymous function `word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)`.\n3. The condition `occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter using a regular expression. The `^` symbol matches the beginning of the string, and `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.\n4. The filtered vector is returned as the output of the function.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"tree\", \"Apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThis solution adheres to the general guidelines for Julia programming, as it uses standard library functions (`filter` and `occursin`) and regular expressions for a concise and efficient implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[349,319],"elapsed":3.809076917,"cost":0.000486,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21800,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
