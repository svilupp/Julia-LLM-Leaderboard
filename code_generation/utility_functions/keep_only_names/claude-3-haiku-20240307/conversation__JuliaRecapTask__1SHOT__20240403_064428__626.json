[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    filtered = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a `Vector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept a vector of any subtype of `AbstractString`, such as `String`.\n2. We initialize an empty `String` array called `filtered` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each word in the input `words` vector.\n4. For each word, we check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we add the word to the `filtered` array using `push!`.\n6. Finally, we return the `filtered` array, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Apple\", \"ball\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThe function is designed to be efficient and clear, using standard Julia language features without any external dependencies. It should meet the requirements of the task and the special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[349,342],"elapsed":3.569815458,"cost":0.00051475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19872,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
