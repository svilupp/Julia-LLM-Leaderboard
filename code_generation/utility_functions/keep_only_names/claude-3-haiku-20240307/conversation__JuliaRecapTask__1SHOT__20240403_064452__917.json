[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> first(word) == uppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes an `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept any vector-like container of strings.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the words where the first character is uppercase.\n3. The condition `first(word) == uppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\nThis solution is concise and efficient, as it uses Julia's standard library functions and avoids unnecessary loops or conditional statements.\n\nLet's test the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"House\", \"tree\", \"Apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly keeps only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[349,259],"elapsed":3.141617209,"cost":0.000411,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22297,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
