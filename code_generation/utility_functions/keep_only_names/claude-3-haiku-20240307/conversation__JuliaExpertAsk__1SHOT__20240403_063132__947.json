The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` list and keep only the elements that satisfy the given condition.\n2. The condition `isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is a letter (using `isletter`) and if it's an uppercase letter (using `isupper`).\n3. The function returns the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[99,194],"elapsed":2.147424291,"cost":0.00026725,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32036,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
