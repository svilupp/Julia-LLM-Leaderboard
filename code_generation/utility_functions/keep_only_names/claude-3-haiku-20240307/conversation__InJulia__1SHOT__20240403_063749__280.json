The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to create a new list that only contains the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The `filter` function checks each word using the `isuppercase(first(word))` expression, which checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n4. The filtered list is returned as the output of the function.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"HOUSE\", \"ball\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"HOUSE\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with a list of words, and it returns a new list that only contains the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,276],"elapsed":2.646931416,"cost":0.00036050000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21494,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
