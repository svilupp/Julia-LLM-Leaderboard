The function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to keep only the elements where the first character is a letter and is uppercase.\n3. The `isletter` and `isupper` functions are used to check the conditions on the first character of each string.\n\nThis will return a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[99,156],"elapsed":2.027236375,"cost":0.00021975000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8847,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
