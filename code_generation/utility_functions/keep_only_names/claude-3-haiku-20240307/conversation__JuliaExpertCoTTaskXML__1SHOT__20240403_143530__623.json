Use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` list.\n2. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))`.\n3. If the condition is true, keep the word, otherwise skip it.\n4. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nThe function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter, as per the task.","status":200,"tokens":[215,263],"elapsed":3.012953667,"cost":0.00038250000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11373,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
