Iterate over the list of words using a `for` loop.\n2. For each word, check if the first character is a letter and if it is uppercase using the `isletter` and `isupper` functions.\n3. If the condition is true, add the word to the `names` list.\n4. Return the `names` list at the end.\n\nThis function will keep only the words that start with a capital letter and remove the rest.","status":200,"tokens":[181,309],"elapsed":3.037616875,"cost":0.0004315,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29675,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
