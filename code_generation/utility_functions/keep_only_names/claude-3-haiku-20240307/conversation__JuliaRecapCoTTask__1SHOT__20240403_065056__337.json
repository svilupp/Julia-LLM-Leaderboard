[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes an `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` as input, which means it can accept any vector-like data structure containing string-like elements.\n2. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the elements where the first character is uppercase. The `isuppercase(first(word))` expression checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. The filtered vector is then returned as the output.\n\nThis solution follows the general guidelines for Julia programming:\n- It uses the standard library function `isuppercase` to check if the first character is uppercase.\n- It uses the `filter` function from the standard library to perform the filtering operation.\n- It uses generic type annotations (`AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}`) to make the function more flexible and applicable to a wider range of input types.\n- It is concise and efficient, avoiding the use of explicit loops or conditionals.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[350,289],"elapsed":3.41871575,"cost":0.00044875000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19747,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
