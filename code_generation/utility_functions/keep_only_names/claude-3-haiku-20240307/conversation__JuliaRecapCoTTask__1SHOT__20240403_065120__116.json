[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `keep_only_names` that solves the given task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function signature `keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})` accepts a vector of strings as input, and the type annotation `AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}` ensures that the input can be any vector-like collection of strings.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` vector and keep only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n3. The condition `isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))` checks that the first character of the word is a letter (using `isletter`) and that it is uppercase (using `isupper`).\n\n4. The `filter` function returns a new vector containing only the words that match the given condition.\n\nThis solution is efficient, clear, and uses standard Julia library functions. It should work for the given task without any further modifications.","status":200,"tokens":[350,271],"elapsed":2.939279916,"cost":0.00042625000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32360,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
