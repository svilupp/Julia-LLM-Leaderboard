The `filter` function is used to create a new array, keeping only the elements that satisfy the provided condition.\n2. The condition `isletter(w[1]) && isupper(w[1])` checks if the first character of each word (`w[1]`) is a letter and if it's an uppercase letter.\n3. The function returns the filtered array of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]`, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"TREE\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,310],"elapsed":4.028435417,"cost":0.00040300000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
