Use the `filter` function to iterate over the `words` list.\n2. For each word, check if the first character is a letter (using `isletter`) and if it's uppercase (using `isupper`).\n3. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nThe function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter, as per the given task.","status":200,"tokens":[181,260],"elapsed":2.76700575,"cost":0.00037025000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
