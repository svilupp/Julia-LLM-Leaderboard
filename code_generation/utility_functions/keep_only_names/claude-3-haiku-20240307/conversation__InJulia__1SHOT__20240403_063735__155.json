The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to create a new list, where each element satisfies the condition specified in the lambda function.\n3. The lambda function checks if the first character of each word is a letter (`isletter(first(word))`) and if it is uppercase (`isupper(first(word))`). This effectively keeps only the words that start with a capital letter.\n4. The resulting list of words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the list of words `[\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"house\", \"Dog\", \"apple\"]`, and it returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,310],"elapsed":3.271977,"cost":0.00040300000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10169,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
