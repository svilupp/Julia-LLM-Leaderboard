The condition for inclusion is determined by the anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided data like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Apple\"\n \"Carrot\"\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function correctly keeps \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\", but removes \"banana\" and \"dog\" because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[203,243],"elapsed":4.130219667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1679116887,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
