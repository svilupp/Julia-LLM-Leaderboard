The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\n4-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"Bird\"\n \"fish\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Bird\"\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function has removed the words \"cat\" and \"fish\" because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[72,236],"elapsed":12.527320375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1819285123,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
