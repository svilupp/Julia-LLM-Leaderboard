[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided problem and special instructions, here is a Julia function that solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `filter` function is used to iterate over the input vector and keep only the words that satisfy the condition `isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Bird\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nPlease note that this function does not modify the original input vector, but instead returns a new vector containing the filtered words. If you want to modify the original vector in-place, you can use the following function instead:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names!(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    deleteat!(words, findall(word -> !isuppercase(word[1]), words))\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `deleteat!` function to remove the words that do not start with a capital letter from the input vector in-place. The `findall` function is used to find the indices of the words that do not satisfy the condition `isuppercase(word[1])`, and these indices are then passed to `deleteat!` to remove the corresponding words from the vector.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Bird\"]\nkeep_only_names!(words)\nprintln(words)  # prints [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis will modify the original vector in-place and print the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[381,544],"elapsed":13.902204375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1786114584,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
