The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[203,220],"elapsed":6.21125325,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":615580136,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
