The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Bird\"]\n6-element Array{String,1}:\n \"dog\"\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"bird\"\n \"Bird\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Bird\"\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function correctly removes the words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[72,256],"elapsed":7.155986125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":90807324,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
