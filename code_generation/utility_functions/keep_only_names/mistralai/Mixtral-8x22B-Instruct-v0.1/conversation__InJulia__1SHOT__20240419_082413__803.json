The condition for inclusion is determined by the anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which returns `true` if the first character of the word is uppercase and `false` otherwise.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Bird\"]\n6-element Array{String,1}:\n \"dog\"\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"bird\"\n \"Bird\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Bird\"\n```\n\nThis will return a new array that only includes the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[72,268],"elapsed":7.962670709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1201949742,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
