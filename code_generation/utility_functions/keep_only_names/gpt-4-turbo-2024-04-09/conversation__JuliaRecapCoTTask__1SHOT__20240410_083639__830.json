[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll implement the function `keep_only_names` in Julia, which will iterate through a provided list of words and filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. The scenario described involves checking for proper nouns typically denoted by capitalization of the first letter in words.\n\n## Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function `keep_only_names` which takes an array of strings `words` as input.\n\n2. **Iteration and Filtering**: Use a comprehension or filter function to iterate over the list and select only those words that satisfy the condition of starting with a capital letter. \n\n3. **Check Capital Letter**: Check the first character of each word to determine if itâ€™s a capital letter. In Julia, this can be achieved using the `isuppercase()` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nHere, I've used a list comprehension for filtering. The condition inside the list comprehension checks:\n- If the word is not empty (`!isempty(word)`) to ensure it has at least one character.\n- If the first character is uppercase (`isuppercase(word[1])`).\n\nThis provided code snippet should efficaciously return a new list with only the words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[324,290],"elapsed":6.48236625,"cost":0.01194,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-349412138,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
