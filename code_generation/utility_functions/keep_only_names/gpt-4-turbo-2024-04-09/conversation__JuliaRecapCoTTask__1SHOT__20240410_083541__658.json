X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Solution Approach\n\nTo solve the problem, we will be using Julia. The key steps will involve iterating over the array of words and selectively keeping those that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets\n- String operations like `startswith` and checking the character case using IEEE code `isuppercase`.\n- Array operation such as filtering using list comprehensions.\n\n### Plan\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of strings.\n2. Filter the array to include only the strings that start with a capital letter. This can be done using a list comprehension or the `filter` function, checking if `isuppercase(word[1])` is true.\n3. Return the resulting filtered list.\n\nGiven that the first character's ASCII code will be checked between 65 (`A`) and 90 (`Z`) to ensure they are uppercase, this can be concisely and accurately captured using `isuppercase`. This function inherently allows us to verify if the first character of the word is indeed an uppercase letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    # Filter words to only keep those that start with an uppercase\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nNow, I'll check the function correctness with some example use-cases to ensure it handles different scenarios reliably.\n\n```julia\n@test keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dog\"]) == [\"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n@test keep_only_names([\"lake\", \"Mountain\", \"river\"]) == [\"Mountain\"]\n@test keep_only_names([\"House\", \"\", \"431\"]) == [\"House\"]\n@test keep_only_names([]) == []\n```\nThis way, the function `keep_only_names` will correctly remove words that do not start with a capital letter, as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[324,382],"elapsed":11.970536709,"cost":0.0147,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":123069431,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
