The steps involve:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n3. Append the word to a new list if condition is met.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\nFor determining if a word starts with a capital letter, we can use Julia's `occursin` or directly check if the first character of the word is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n\nLet's proceed with the code.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Define a new list to hold words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\ntest_data = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(test_data))  # Expected Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis code should correctly produce the output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, filtering out \"banana\" and \"dog\" because they don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[173,287],"elapsed":6.871019667,"cost":0.01034,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-207353426,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
