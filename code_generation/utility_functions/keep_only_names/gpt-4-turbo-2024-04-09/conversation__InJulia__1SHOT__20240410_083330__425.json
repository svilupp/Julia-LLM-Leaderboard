Here's how you can write the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Details:\n1. **`isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])`**: This condition checks two things: \n   - `isempty(word)`: ensures that the word is not empty to prevent an error when accessing `word[1]`.\n   - `isuppercase(word[1])`: checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\n2. **Array Comprehension `[word for word in words if ...]`**: This constructs a new array including only those elements that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\", \"Fox\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n```julia\n[\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Fox\"]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently checks each word in the input list and keeps only those starting with a capital letter, returning the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,295],"elapsed":6.847292459,"cost":0.00949,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1316913079,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
