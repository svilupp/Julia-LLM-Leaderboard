[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes one argument, `words`, which is a list of strings.\n2. Use a list comprehension to iterate over `words`.\n3. During iteration, select only those words that start with a capital letter. This can be done using the method `str[0].isupper()`, where `str[0]` is the first character which should be uppercase to retain the string.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\n### Code:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words keeping only those that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\nTo verify the correctness of this function, here's an example test case based on the guidelines:\n\n- Input: `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`\n- Expected Output: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`\n\nImplementing this in the provided Julia function together with a correct execution should confirm the accuracy of the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[173,230],"elapsed":5.783899208,"cost":0.00863,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":831050974,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
