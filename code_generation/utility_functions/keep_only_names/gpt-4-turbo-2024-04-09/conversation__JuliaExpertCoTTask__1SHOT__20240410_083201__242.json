Words that start with capital letters represent potential \"names\" or proper nouns, so they are kept.\n\n2. **Developing a Method**:\n   - Iterate over the list of words.\n   - For each word, check if the first letter is uppercase using the appropriate string method.\n   - Collect words that fulfill this condition.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Use list comprehension for a concise solution.\n   - Employ the `str.istitle()` function from Python which checks if the string is title cased (`True` for \"Apple\" but `False` for \"apple\").\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Include checks for words in the proper and improper case.\n   - Use an empty list to ensure that the function behaves correctly with zero input.\n\nLet's write the function applying these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example to verify the implementation\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis code should effectively return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` for the given example, filtering out \"banana\" and \"dog\".","status":200,"tokens":[173,303],"elapsed":11.014193291,"cost":0.010820000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1802875143,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
