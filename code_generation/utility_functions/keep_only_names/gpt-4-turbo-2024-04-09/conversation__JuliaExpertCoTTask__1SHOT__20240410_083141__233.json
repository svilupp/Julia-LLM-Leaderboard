This can be checked using Python's string function `isupper()` applied to the first character of each word.\n3. **Return Result**: The function should return the filtered list.\n\nThe approach leverages Python's inherent capability to handle string operations concisely.\n\nLet's implement the solution.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Using list comprehension and isupper() to filter the words that start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if word[1].isupper()]\nend\n\n# Test the function with provided data\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis solution expects the `words` array to contain non-empty strings as accessing `word[1]` will throw an index error for empty strings. As part of good practice and robust handling, additional checks can be added if such cases are anticipated.","status":200,"tokens":[173,256],"elapsed":6.887258833,"cost":0.00941,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":471116443,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
