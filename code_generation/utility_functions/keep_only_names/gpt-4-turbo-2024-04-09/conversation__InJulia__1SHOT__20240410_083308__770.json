Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a vector of strings.\n2. **Filter Function**: It uses the `filter` function, which applies a condition to each item in the list:\n   - `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`: This is a lambda function that checks if the first character of `word` is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n   - `first(word)`: This extracts the first character of the string `word`.\n\n### Example Usage\nHereâ€™s how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Date\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Banana\", \"Date\"]\n```\n\nThis function will display `[\"Banana\", \"Date\"]` because these words start with a capital letter, while \"apple\" and \"cherry\" do not and are therefore filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[64,297],"elapsed":7.724062083,"cost":0.00955,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-31992303,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
