Here, a capital letter is any character from `'A'` to `'Z'`. You can check the first character of each word using regular string indexing in Julia and then compare it using character comparison.\n\nHere's how you could implement the `keep_only_names` function using both techniques:\n\n### Method 1: Using `filter`\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter out words that don't start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> (isuppercase(word[1])), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using a list comprehension\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # List comprehension to keep only words starting with a capital letter\n    [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"]\nkept_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(kept_words)  # Output should be [\"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nEach of these functions assumes that `words` contains non-empty strings, as `word[1]` will throw an error if the string is empty. If thereâ€™s a possibility of encountering empty strings, you might want to add a check to confirm that the string is not empty before accessing its first character or safely use the `startswith()` function:\n\n### Enhanced Version with Empty Check\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis additional check (`!isempty(word)`) ensures that the function does not attempt to access the first character of an empty string, which would result in an error.","status":200,"tokens":[64,401],"elapsed":10.262763292,"cost":0.01267,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1926382745,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
