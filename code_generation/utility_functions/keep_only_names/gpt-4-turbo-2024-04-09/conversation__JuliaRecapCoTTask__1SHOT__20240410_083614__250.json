[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem of implementing the `keep_only_names` function in Julia, the approach involves filtering the list such that only words beginning with a capital letter are retained. The Unicode standard provides a method to check if a character is uppercase, which can be used directly in Julia with the function `isuppercase(char)`. \n\nFor this particular problem:\n- A single pass filter will suffice to check each word and determine if the first character is uppercase.\n- The words that meet the criteria will then be collected into a new list.\n\nLet's proceed to implement the function.\n\n### Julia function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The `filter` function in Julia allows checking each element against a condition. \n2. The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n3. `filter` then collects all words that satisfy this condition into a new array that gets returned.\n\nThis function should work efficiently for a standard array of words, adhering to Julia's concise and clear syntax for functional operations like filtering.","status":200,"tokens":[324,254],"elapsed":6.955932375,"cost":0.01086,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-424674283,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
