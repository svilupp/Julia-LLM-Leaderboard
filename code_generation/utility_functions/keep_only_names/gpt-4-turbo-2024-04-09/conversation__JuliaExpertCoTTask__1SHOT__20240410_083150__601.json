If true, retain the word in the list; if false, discard it.\n    - Return the filtered list.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:** \n    - The function will use the `startswith()` string method to check the case of the first letter.\n    - Compilation of a new list based on the uppercase condition using a list comprehension.\n    \n3. **Code:** \n   ```julia\n   function keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n       filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n       return filtered_words\n   end\n   ```\n\n4. **Solve the task**\n\n5. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n    - Test the function `keep_only_names` with the sample input `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`.\n    - Expected output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # This should print [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis accurate approach will validate the correct implementation of our task.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nNow, to validate our function, we'll test it briefly:\n\n```julia\n# Testing the function\ninputs = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\noutput = keep_only_names(inputs)\nprintln(output)  # Should print [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis testing process should accurately reflect that we've achieved the goal set out in the task description.","status":200,"tokens":[173,431],"elapsed":9.582473,"cost":0.014660000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1950720921,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
