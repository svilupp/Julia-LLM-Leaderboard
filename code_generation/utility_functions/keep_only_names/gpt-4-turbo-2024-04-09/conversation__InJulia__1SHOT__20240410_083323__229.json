You will typically use the function `startswith` along with the condition of the word starting with a capital letter which can be checked using a regular expression, or by checking if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\nHereâ€™s how you could write the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter the array to keep only words starting with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can check using a regular expression to see if the word starts with an uppercase character:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Using regex to filter words starting with uppercase letters\n    filter(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nBoth versions of the function take a list of words as input and return a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test the function by passing a list of words with varying cases:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\", \"Fox\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n[\"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Fox\"]\n```\n\nBoth should work effectively depending on the specific requirements or preferences for simplicity or clarity in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[64,319],"elapsed":7.561996583,"cost":0.01021,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1055758666,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
