[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task:\n\n1. We need a function that iterates over a list of words.\n2. For each word, if it starts with a capital letter (i.e., the first character is a capital letter), it should be kept.\n3. Otherwise, the word should be omitted.\n4. We will utilize Unicode and a simple check against `'A' <= c <= 'Z'` to verify if the first character is uppercase.\n\nLet's construct the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if (word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z')]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nHere, we use a list comprehension to filter the words. We check the first character of each word to ensure it is a capital letter.\n\nTest cases:\n\n1. When `words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"fruit\"]`, the result should be `[\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]`.\n2. For `words = []`, the result should be an empty list `[]` as there are no words to process.\n3. If all items are capitalized like `words = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`, the result should be the same list `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[323,291],"elapsed":7.068535667,"cost":0.01196,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":968829885,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
