[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The goal is to filter a list of words, retaining only those that start with a capital letter. In Julia, to accomplish this task, we can use the functions `filter` in combination with string functions such as `startswith` which checks if a string starts with a specific substring or character.\n\nWe can define a helper function `starts_with_capital` that checks if a word starts with a capital letter by using the `isuppercase` function on the first character of the string. This function then can be used with `filter` to iterate over the words list and keep only those words that satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in a function `keep_only_names`.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retains only the words that start with a capital letter among the provided list.\n    \"\"\"\n    function starts_with_capital(word::String)::Bool\n        return !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])\n    end\n    \n    return filter(starts_with_capital, words)\nend\n```\n\nThe above implementation includes thorough type annotations for clarity, specifying input to be a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`) and outputs to be similarly typed for consistency. The helper function `starts_with_capital` checks if the word is non-empty (to avoid errors) and if the first character is uppercase. The `filter` function applies this logic to each item in the list, returning only those that meet the criterion.","status":200,"tokens":[324,305],"elapsed":10.818539833,"cost":0.01239,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":420508887,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
