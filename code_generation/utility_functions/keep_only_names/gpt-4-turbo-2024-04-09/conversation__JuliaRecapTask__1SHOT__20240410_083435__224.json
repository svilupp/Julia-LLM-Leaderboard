[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, I will create a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that filters out elements from a list of words, retaining only those words that start with a capital letter. The function will:\n- Iterate through the given list of strings.\n- Check if the first character of each string is a capital letter using the function `isuppercase`.\n- Collect the words that start with uppercase letters into a new list.\n- Return the filtered list.\n\nThis approach utilizes basic string manipulation and conditional checking in Julia. I will now proceed to implement the function using this plan.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter and return words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the function:\n- Receives a vector of strings, `words`.\n- Uses the `filter` function to go through each word.\n- The condition applied is `!isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])`, which ensures the word is not empty and its first character is uppercase.\n- The words that satisfy this condition are collected and returned as a filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[323,248],"elapsed":5.370935208,"cost":0.01067,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1670005159,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
