[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, the function `keep_only_names` will need to filter out words from the provided list that do not start with a capital letter. This can be accomplished by checking the first letter of each word to see if it is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function, and retaining only those words which start with an uppercase letter.\n\n## Plan\n1. Read the list `words`.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list.\n3. Check if the first letter of the word is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n4. If itâ€™s uppercase, keep the word in the result.\n5. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nNow, let's implement this step by step.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Testing the function with provided data\nexample_words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(example_words))  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `keep_only_names`, which accepts a list of words and returns only those words starting with a capital letter. The test indicates that it should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[173,266],"elapsed":7.457963542,"cost":0.009710000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":445081349,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
