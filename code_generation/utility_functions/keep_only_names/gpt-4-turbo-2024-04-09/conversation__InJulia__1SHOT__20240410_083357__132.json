Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})`: Defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. `filter(...)`: Filter allows us to apply a condition to each element in the `words` array and keep only those elements that satisfy the condition.\n3. `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`: This is a lambda (anonymous) function that checks two conditions for each `word`:\n   - `first(word)`: Fetches the first character of the word.\n   - `isuppercase(...)`: Checks if that first character is uppercase.\n4. `words`: The array that `filter` processes.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"david\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\n```\n\nThis function now only includes those words in the returned array that begin with a capital letter, effectively filtering out words like \"bob\" and \"david\" which start with lowercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[64,319],"elapsed":26.305360458,"cost":0.01021,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1032184780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
