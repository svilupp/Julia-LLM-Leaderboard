[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of filtering out words that do not start with a capital letter from a list, we'll use the following Julia code steps:\n\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as its input.\n2. Use list comprehension to filter this list. Within the list comprehension:\n   - For each element, check if the first character is a capital letter.\n   - To determine if a character is capital, check if it falls within the ASCII range for capital letters (`'A' <= c <= 'Z'`) or use the built-in `isuppercase` function from Julia.\n3. The filtered list will only include words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere is an implementation of these steps in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the list, retaining names that start with a capital letter.\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis function can be tested with a list of sample words to confirm that it correctly retains only those words beginning with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[323,230],"elapsed":5.458004875,"cost":0.01013,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-967838441,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
