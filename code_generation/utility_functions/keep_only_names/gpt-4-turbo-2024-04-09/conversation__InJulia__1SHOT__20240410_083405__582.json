In Julia, you can define a function called `keep_only_names` that filters out words from a list based on whether they start with a capital letter. Below is one way to implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a list `words` as an argument.\n2. **Filtering**: The `filter` function is used to iterate over each word in `words`.\n3. **Condition**: The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. The `filter` function includes only those words in the output where this condition is true.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHereâ€™s how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output will be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis example shows that \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" are kept because they start with uppercase letters, while \"banana\" and \"dog\" are removed as they start with lowercase letters.","status":200,"tokens":[64,277],"elapsed":7.83104675,"cost":0.00895,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-528931109,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
