This function takes a list of words and filters out those that do not start with a capital letter. In Julia, you can use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a word is uppercase.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list to include only words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The function `keep_only_names` uses the `filter` function with a custom filtering function. \n- The filtering function uses `isuppercase` to check if the first character of `word` (i.e., `word[1]`) is uppercase.\n- Only words that satisfy this condition are kept.\n\nWhen you run the example usage, `filtered_words` will contain `[\"Apple\", \"Cherry\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[64,233],"elapsed":5.214287625,"cost":0.0076300000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":25556009,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
