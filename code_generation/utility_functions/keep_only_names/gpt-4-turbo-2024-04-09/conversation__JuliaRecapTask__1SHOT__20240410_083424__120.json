[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of words named `words`.\n2. The function will iterate through `words` and select only those words that start with a capital letter.\n3. A word starts with a capital letter if the ASCII value of the first character is between 65 ('A') and 90 ('Z'). Alternatively, in Julia, a simpler check `isuppercase(word[1])` can be used.\n4. The filtered words will be returned.\n\nThis function can be concisely written using an array filter or a list comprehension in Julia. We will make use of the string indexing and character comparison features of the language for an idiomatic solution.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis Julia function:\n- Inputs a vector of strings `words`.\n- Filters and keeps only those words where the first character is uppercase.\n- Returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[323,230],"elapsed":5.538992459,"cost":0.01013,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1303551541,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
