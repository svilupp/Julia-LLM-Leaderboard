[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement `keep_only_names`, we need to filter out words from the list that do not start with a capital letter. In Julia, the function will iterate over each word in the provided array, check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase()`, and retain the word if this condition is met. The result will be a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's the implementation plan:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` which takes an array of strings (`words`) as an input.\n2. Use a comprehension list to filter the words. Loop through each word in `words`.\n3. For each word, use the `isuppercase` function on the first character (`word[1]`) to ascertain if it starts with a capital letter.\n4. Return a new array containing only the words that passed the uppercase condition.\n\nNext, I'll implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nTesting will follow to ensure the function behaves as expected, especially taking care of non-empty assertions and considering different variations in word capitalizations. This approach not only satisfies the task requirements but is concise and efficient, leveraging Juliaâ€™s native string and array operations.","status":200,"tokens":[324,270],"elapsed":6.338237583,"cost":0.01134,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":359775542,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
