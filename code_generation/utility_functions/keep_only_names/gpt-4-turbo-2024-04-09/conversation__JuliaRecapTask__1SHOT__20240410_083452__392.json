[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement the function `keep_only_names`, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. **Filtering Logic**: We will use an array comprehension that includes conditional checks to filter out words that don't start with a capital letter.\n2. **Str and Char Operations**: Julia strings can be indexed to get characters, and the `isuppercase` function will be used to check if a character is uppercase.\n\nThe function will loop through each word in the input list, check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`, and then keep the word in the list if the condition is true.\n\nHere's the complete implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis function checks:\n- Whether the string is empty before accessing its first index.\n- If the first character is uppercase and retains such words in the result.\n\n**Test examples:**\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"dog\"]))  # [\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Marker\", \"notebook\"]))                # [\"Marker\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"good\", \"maybe\", \"Perhaps\"]))          # [\"Perhaps\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"1123\", \"@abc\", \"Asia\", \"europe\"]))    # [\"Asia\"]\n```\n\nAll these steps ensure a clean, concise, and efficient implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[323,323],"elapsed":7.81564275,"cost":0.012920000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1519047565,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
