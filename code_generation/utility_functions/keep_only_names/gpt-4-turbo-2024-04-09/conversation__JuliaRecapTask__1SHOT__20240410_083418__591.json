[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"We need to write a function `keep_only_names` which will remove words from the provided list if they don't start with a capital letter. A capital letter is defined by the characters 'A' through 'Z'. We can check for this condition by using the function `isuppercase` on the first character of each word in the list. Let's consider the steps in Julia:\n\n1. Accept a list of words.\n2. Iterate through each word in the list.\n3. Check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. Keep only those words starting with an uppercase letter in the result list.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\nIn Julia, iterating through a list of words can be done using a list comprehension which is efficient and concise. Checking the first letter of a word and verifying if it's uppercase will filter the words we want to keep.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis Julia function fulfills the requirements effectively by filtering words based on the starting letter using a conditional check within a list comprehension. Make sure that when using `word[1]`, the word is non-empty to avoid any indexing errors. This however is assumed to not be an issue as typical use cases would involve normal non-empty strings when dealing with names or nouns.","status":200,"tokens":[323,293],"elapsed":8.415483375,"cost":0.012020000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1817262446,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
