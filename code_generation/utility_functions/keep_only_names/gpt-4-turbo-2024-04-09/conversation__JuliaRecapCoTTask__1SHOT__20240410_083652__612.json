[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to filter out a list of words based on whether the first letter of each word is capitalized. The function `keep_only_names` will take a list of words as input and return a new list containing only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe plan:\n1. Iterate through each word in the input list.\n2. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase()` function.\n3. Append words that pass the condition to a new list.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation makes use of Julia's `filter` function to efficiently select words where the first character meets the uppercase condition. The `first()` function retrieves the first character of the string to check its case with `isuppercase()`. We use a succinct anonymous function within `filter` to apply this logic over the list of words. This approach handles the task efficiently and in a clear manner, aligned with our initial plan.","status":200,"tokens":[324,240],"elapsed":5.885611292,"cost":0.01044,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-197134275,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
