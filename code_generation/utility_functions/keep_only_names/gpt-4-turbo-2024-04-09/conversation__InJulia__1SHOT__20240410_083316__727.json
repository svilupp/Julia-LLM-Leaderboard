Here is a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over a list of strings and keeps only those strings that start with a capital letter using the second method for simplicity:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words to keep only those that start with an uppercase letter.\n    # The function isletter(c) and isuppercase(c) can be used to ensure\n    # the character is a letter and is uppercase, respectively.\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isletter(word[1]) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this code, the `keep_only_names` function uses the `filter` function along with a lambda that checks:\n- If the word is not empty (`!isempty(word)`).\n- If the first character of each word is a letter (`isletter(word[1])`).\n- If the first character of each word is uppercase (`isuppercase(word[1])`).\n\nThis filters out any words that do not meet all these conditions.","status":200,"tokens":[64,294],"elapsed":7.5409785,"cost":0.00946,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1882658178,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
