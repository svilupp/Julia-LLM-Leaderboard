Julia provides a convenient function `isuppercase` which checks if a character is uppercase. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words as input and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` accepts one parameter, `words`, which should be an array of strings.\n2. **Filter Function**: It uses the `filter` function to select only those words that meet a specific criterion.\n3. **Lambda Function**: The lambda `(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word)))` is passed to `filter`. This lambda checks each word to see if it is not empty (`!isempty(word)`) and if its first character is uppercase (`isuppercase(first(word))`). The `first(word)` function returns the first character of the string `word`.\n4. **Return Value**: The `filter` function returns an array of all words fulfilling the specified criteria, effectively removing words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nThis example will print the words \"Banana\" and \"Dog\" which start with capital letters, filtering out \"apple\" and \"cherry\".","status":200,"tokens":[64,355],"elapsed":8.196612542,"cost":0.01129,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1757180562,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
