[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task of filtering out words from a list that do not start with a capital letter, we can utilize array filtering in Julia. The approach involves:\n\n1. Looping over the array of words.\n2. Checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n3. Keeping words that satisfy this condition.\n\nIn Julia, we can efficiently implement this using list comprehension, which provides a concise way to filter elements.\n\nLetâ€™s construct the function `keep_only_names` based on these insights:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function:\n- Takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n- The list comprehension filters words where the first character is uppercase.\n- Returns the filtered list of words.\n\nThis solution should work effectively for the provided task, considering it operates directly on strings and uses built-in string handling and array comprehension features of Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[324,205],"elapsed":7.136143208,"cost":0.00939,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-708523337,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
