[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will create a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words and filters it based on the capitalization of the first letter in each entry.\n\nSteps to solve the Task:\n1. Review and recall useful Julia snippets: To filter an array, I can use list comprehension, which is a compact way to filter and map elements of a list.\n2. Implement the function `keep_only_names`:\n   - Use list comprehension to iterate over the input list.\n   - Check the first character of each word to verify if it's uppercase using `isuppercase(char)`.\n3. Ensure the solution's correctness by checking against various cases, including edge cases like an empty input list or all-capitalized list.\n\nLet's implement these ideas in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Using list comprehension to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `words::Vector{String}` specifies an input array of strings.\n- `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of `word` is uppercase.\n- The list comprehension creates a new list with words that meet the specified conditions.\n- `!isempty(word)` ensures that the word isn't an empty string, as indexing an empty string would cause an error.","status":200,"tokens":[324,299],"elapsed":7.698523625,"cost":0.01221,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1030377074,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
