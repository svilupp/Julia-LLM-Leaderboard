Create a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Iterate through the list and check each word to determine if it starts with a capital letter. This can be done using the `startswith()` function combined with uppercase alphabets `A-Z`.\n3. Compile a new list containing only those words which start with a capital letter.\n4. Return the new list.\n\nLet's proceed with implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty list to store valid names\n    valid_names = []\n    # Check each word in the input list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter of word is uppercase\n        if (word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z')\n            push!(valid_names, word) # Add to the list if condition is met\n        end\n    end\n    return valid_names\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(example_words)\nprintln(result)  # Output should be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis code checks if the first character is between 'A' and 'Z' to determine if it is an uppercase letter. If true, that word is added to the `valid_names` list.","status":200,"tokens":[173,301],"elapsed":9.799358208,"cost":0.01076,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":70839643,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
