The lambda function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. **Testing**: The function is tested with the provided data `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`.\n\n### Output:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis output confirms that the function correctly filters out words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[194,262],"elapsed":7.08309575,"cost":0.00294,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":139483382,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
