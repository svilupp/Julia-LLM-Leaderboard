Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Use a list comprehension to filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter the words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase. The filtered list of words is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[63,226],"elapsed":6.930525,"cost":0.002223,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2063783433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
