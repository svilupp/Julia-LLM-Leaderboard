[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's solve the task step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nWe'll need to:\n- Iterate over a list of words.\n- Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n- Filter out words that do not meet the criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nHere's the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's test the function with some examples to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nwords1 = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nwords2 = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"date\"]\nwords3 = [\"Julia\", \"python\", \"Ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nprintln(keep_only_names(words1)) # Expected: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words2)) # Expected: [\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words3)) # Expected: [\"Julia\", \"Ruby\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `filter` is used to iterate over the list and apply a condition.\n- `isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n- The function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Final Code\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Test cases\nwords1 = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nwords2 = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"date\"]\nwords3 = [\"Julia\", \"python\", \"Ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nprintln(keep_only_names(words1)) # Expected: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words2)) # Expected: [\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words3)) # Expected: [\"Julia\", \"Ruby\"]\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly and efficiently for the given task.","status":200,"tokens":[372,626],"elapsed":12.640480667,"cost":0.00675,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":906677546,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
