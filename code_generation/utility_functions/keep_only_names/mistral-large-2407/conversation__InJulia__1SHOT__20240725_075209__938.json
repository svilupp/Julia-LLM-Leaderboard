Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that iterates over a provided list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\", \"Monkey\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Monkey\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. **Filtering**: The `filter` function is used to keep only those words where the first character is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n3. **Return**: The filtered list of words is returned.\n\nYou can test this function with different lists of words to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[63,289],"elapsed":8.444235833,"cost":0.00279,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1370835748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
