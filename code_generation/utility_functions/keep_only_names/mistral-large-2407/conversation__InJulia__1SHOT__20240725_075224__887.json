Below is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. **Initialize Result Vector**: An empty vector `filtered_words` is initialized to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. **Iterate Over Words**: The function iterates over each word in the input list.\n4. **Check Capitalization**: For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n5. **Add to Result**: If the word starts with a capital letter, it is added to the `filtered_words` vector.\n6. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test this function with different lists of words to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[63,380],"elapsed":8.979389166,"cost":0.0036090000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1706644649,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
