Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a single argument `words`, which is expected to be a vector of strings.\n2. **Filtering**: The `filter` function is used to iterate over the `words` vector. The lambda function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. **Return**: The filtered list of words is returned.\n\nThis function will keep only the words that start with a capital letter and remove the rest.","status":200,"tokens":[63,299],"elapsed":6.105928708,"cost":0.00288,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2121299556,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
