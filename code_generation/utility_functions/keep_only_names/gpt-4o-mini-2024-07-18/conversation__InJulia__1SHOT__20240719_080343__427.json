In Julia, you can create a function to filter a list of words based on whether they start with a capital letter. Here's how you can implement the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `filter`: This function is used to filter elements from the `words` vector based on a condition.\n2. `word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])`: This is an anonymous function that checks each word to see if it is not empty and its first character is uppercase.\n   - `!isempty(word)`: Ensures that the word is not empty to avoid index errors.\n   - `isuppercase(word[1])`: Checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Giraffe\", \"mouse\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output will be [\"Cat\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nThis function will return a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,254],"elapsed":3.452261792,"cost":0.00016199999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-926052551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
