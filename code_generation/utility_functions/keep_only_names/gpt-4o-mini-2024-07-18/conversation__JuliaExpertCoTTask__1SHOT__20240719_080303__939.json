[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's approach this step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Function**: We will create a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. **Iterate and Filter**: We will iterate over the list and filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return a new list containing only the words that pass the filter.\n\nNow, let's write the code for the function.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nNext, we will test the provided data.\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nNow, let's ensure our solution is correct by running the test. \n\n### Check\n\nRunning the above code, we should see the output is `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, confirming that our function works as intended.
