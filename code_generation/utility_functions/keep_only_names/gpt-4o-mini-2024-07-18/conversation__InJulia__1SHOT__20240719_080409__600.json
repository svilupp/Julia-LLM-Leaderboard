Hereâ€™s an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `keep_only_names` takes a single argument `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n2. **Filtering**: It uses the `filter` function to create a new array that includes only the words that satisfy the condition `isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n3. **Return Value**: The result is returned as a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Zebra\", \"monkey\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation will effectively keep only those words that are names, starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,250],"elapsed":2.431680958,"cost":0.00015959999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":848354119,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
