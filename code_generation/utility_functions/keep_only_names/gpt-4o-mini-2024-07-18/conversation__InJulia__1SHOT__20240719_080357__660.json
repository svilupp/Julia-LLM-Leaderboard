Below is a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that accomplishes what you're looking for. This function takes a list of words and retains only those that start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Use the filter function to keep only the words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && iscapitalized(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nIn the `keep_only_names` function:\n- We use the `filter` function which applies a predicate to each element of the `words` array.\n- The predicate checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter using `iscapitalized`.\n- We also check that the word is not empty to avoid any indexing errors.\n\nYou can test this function with the example usage provided or with your own list of words!","status":200,"tokens":[64,235],"elapsed":2.475261042,"cost":0.00015059999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-559859276,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
