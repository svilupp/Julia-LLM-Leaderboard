[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of creating a function `keep_only_names` that filters out words not starting with a capital letter, I'll follow the systematic problem-solving steps you've provided.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia snippets useful for this Task\n- Define a function using `function` keyword.\n- Use control structures, particularly a loop, such as `for` to iterate over the array.\n- Use `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\nHere's how the implementation can look in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n- The function takes an array of strings.\n- It iterates over each word and checks if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n- Words that meet this condition are collected into a new array and returned.\n\n### Example Usage\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Dog\", \"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation adheres to the task requirements and uses proper Julia syntax, ensuring clarity and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[322,272],"elapsed":3.500062208,"cost":0.0002115,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1115287808,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
