In Julia, you can create the function `keep_only_names` that filters out words not starting with a capital letter. Below is an implementation of this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\", \"Giraffe\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a single argument `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n\n2. **Filter Function**: Inside the function, we use the `filter` function.\n   - The condition checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`. \n   - We also ensure that the word is not empty with `!isempty(word)` to avoid indexing errors.\n\n3. **Return Value**: The `filter` function returns a new array containing only the words that satisfy the condition.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can call this function with a list of words, and it will return a new list with only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,280],"elapsed":4.253085125,"cost":0.00017759999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-319655542,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
