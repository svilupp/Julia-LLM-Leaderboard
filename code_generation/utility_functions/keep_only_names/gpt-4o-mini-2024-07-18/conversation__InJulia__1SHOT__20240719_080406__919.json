Below is a sample implementation of this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`).\n- It uses the `filter` function to iterate through each word in the list.\n- The anonymous function (lambda function) checks two conditions:\n  - `!isempty(word)`: This ensures that we don't attempt to access the first character of an empty string.\n  - `isuppercase(word[1])`: This checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n- The result is a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Example of usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Ant\", \"zebra\", \"Bear\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Ant\", \"Bear\"]\n```\n\nThis will keep only those words that start with a capital letter, effectively filtering out the rest.","status":200,"tokens":[64,258],"elapsed":2.385752292,"cost":0.00016439999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1588811636,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
