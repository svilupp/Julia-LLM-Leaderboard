You can create the `keep_only_names` function in Julia that filters out words that do not start with a capital letter. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter the words to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`).\n- It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the provided list.\n- The condition `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n- The function returns a new array containing only the words that meet this condition.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Lion\", \"tiger\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nYou can modify or expand upon this function to fit any additional requirements you might have!","status":200,"tokens":[64,225],"elapsed":4.295079375,"cost":0.0001446,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1883668771,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
