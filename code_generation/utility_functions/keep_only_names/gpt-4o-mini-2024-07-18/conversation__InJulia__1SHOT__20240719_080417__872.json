Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter the words, keeping only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"lion\", \"Elephant\", \"bat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function `keep_only_names` accepts a vector of strings as its parameter.\n2. It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` vector.\n3. The condition `!isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])` checks that the word is not empty and that the first character is uppercase.\n4. The function returns a new vector containing only the words that meet this condition. \n\nYou can call this function with a list of words, and it will return the filtered list with only the names (words starting with a capital letter).","status":200,"tokens":[64,253],"elapsed":3.958040375,"cost":0.0001614,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":234823251,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
