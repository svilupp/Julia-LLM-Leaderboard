Here's an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase_first(word)]\nend\n\nfunction isuppercase_first(word::String)\n    return !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`keep_only_names` function**: This function takes a vector of strings as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word and includes it in the result only if it starts with an uppercase letter.\n   \n2. **`isuppercase_first` function**: This helper function checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase. It also ensures the word is not empty before checking the case.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\", \"Zebra\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis will keep only the words that start with a capital letter and return the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,260],"elapsed":4.068821166,"cost":0.0001656,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-517927596,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
