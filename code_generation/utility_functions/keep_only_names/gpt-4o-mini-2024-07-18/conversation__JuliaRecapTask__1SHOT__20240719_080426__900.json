[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's create the function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and retains only those that start with a capital letter. We'll use Julia's array comprehensions for a concise solution.\n\n### Step 1: Recall Julia Snippets\n- We can use an array comprehension to filter words.\n- The `isuppercase` function will help check if a character is uppercase.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\nThe function can be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the Solution\n1. This function checks if the word is non-empty and if the first character is uppercase.\n2. It returns a new array containing only the filtered words.\n\nNow let's test this function with some sample data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"tiger\", \"Bear\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Should print: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Bear\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly filters the list based on the specified criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[321,250],"elapsed":3.039287708,"cost":0.00019815,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-992980242,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
