In Julia, you can define the function `keep_only_names` to filter a list of words by checking if they start with a capital letter. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `filter` is a built-in Julia function that takes a predicate (a function that returns true or false) and a collection, returning a new collection with only the elements that satisfy the predicate.\n- `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` is a lambda function that checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n- The function returns a new array consisting only of the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Elephant\", \"bear\", \"Zebra\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output will be: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words, and it will return a new list containing only those words that begin with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,246],"elapsed":2.58050425,"cost":0.00015719999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-530146309,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
