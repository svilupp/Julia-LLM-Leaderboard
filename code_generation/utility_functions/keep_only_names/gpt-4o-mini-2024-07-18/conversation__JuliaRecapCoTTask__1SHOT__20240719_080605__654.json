[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of creating a function `keep_only_names`, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Recall useful Julia snippets**: We need to define a function, iterate over the list of words, check the first character of each word, and filter out those that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - We'll use the `uppercase` function to check if the first character of each word is its uppercase version.\n   - Use a list comprehension to construct a new list that retains only the desired words.\n\nHereâ€™s how the function can be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{T}) where T<:AbstractString\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]]\nend\n```\n\n3. **Double-check the solution**: \n   - We would want to test the function with different input cases to ensure it works correctly:\n     - An input list that contains both capitalized and non-capitalized words.\n     - An input with empty strings or strings consisting only of lowercase letters.\n     - A list with all capitalized words should return the same list.\n\nNow let's test the function:\n\n```julia\n# Test Cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\"]))  # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\"]))       # Should return [\"Cherry\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"peach\", \"Grape\"])) # Should return [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Grape\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"panda\"]))              # Should return []\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"\", \"NotEmpty\", \"lowercase\"]))        # Should return [\"NotEmpty\"]\n```\n\nLet's run this code to confirm the results are as expected. \n\nOverall, this systematic approach ensures clarity, correctness, and performance with the Julia programming language.","status":200,"tokens":[322,420],"elapsed":3.862650166,"cost":0.0003003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":387340023,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
