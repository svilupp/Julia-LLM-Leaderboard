Here's a simple implementation of that function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\", \"Zebra\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as its argument.\n- We use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` array.\n- The condition `!isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the word is not empty and if its first character is uppercase.\n- The result is a new array containing only the words that meet the criteria of starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,223],"elapsed":6.876135875,"cost":0.0001434,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":198090828,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
