It checks if the current `word` starts with a capital letter:\n        - **`uppercase(word[1])`:** Gets the first letter of the `word` and converts it to uppercase.\n        - **`startswith(word, ...)`:**  Checks if the `word` starts with the uppercase first letter.\n\n    - **`word`:** If the condition is true (the word starts with a capital letter), the `word` itself is included in the new list being created.\n\n3. **`end`:**  Marks the end of the function definition.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n```julia\nmy_words = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"sunshine\", \"Fish\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(my_words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"sunshine\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore more Julia functions!","status":200,"tokens":[69,391],"elapsed":1.02869075,"cost":9.199999999999999e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1254140422,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
