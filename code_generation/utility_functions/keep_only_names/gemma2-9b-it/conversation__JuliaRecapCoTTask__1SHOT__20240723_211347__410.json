[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n  return filter(words, isspace == false)\nend            \n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - We define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a single argument: `words`, which is a vector of strings.\n\n2. **Filtering:**\n   -  We use the built-in `filter` function to iterate through each word in the `words` vector. \n   - For each word, we check if it starts with an uppercase letter using the `isspace` function.  \n   - If a word starts with a capital letter, it is kept; otherwise, it is removed.\n\n3. **Return:**\n   - The `filter` function returns a new vector containing only the words that passed the condition (starting with a capital letter). This new vector is what our function returns.\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or would like to explore different approaches!","status":200,"tokens":[341,218],"elapsed":0.690028333,"cost":0.00011179999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-225699790,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
