[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(words, &is_name)\nend\n\nfunction is_name(word::String)\n    return begins_with(word, uppercase(word[1]))\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`keep_only_names` Function:**\n   - Takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n   - Uses the `filter` function to iterate over each `word` in the `words` vector.\n   - For each `word`, it calls the `is_name` function to check if it meets the criteria. \n   - `filter` keeps only the words for which `is_name` returns `true`.\n\n2. **`is_name` Function:**\n   - Takes a single string (`word`) as input.\n   - `begins_with(word, uppercase(word[1]))` checks if the `word` starts with the uppercase version of its first character. This effectively identifies names that start with a capital letter.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n\n\n- The `filter` function acts like a sieve. It examines each word in the input list and passes it through the `is_name` function.\n- The `is_name` function determines if the word is a \"name\" based on the capitalization rule.\n- Only words that pass the `is_name` test are retained in the output, effectively \"keeping only names\". \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like to see an example of how to use this function!","status":200,"tokens":[341,343],"elapsed":0.925278,"cost":0.0001368,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2120563822,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
