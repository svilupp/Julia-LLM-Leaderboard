[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n  return filter(x -> startswith(x, uppercase(x[1])) , words)\nend\n```\n\n  \n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition:** \n   - We define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a single argument `words`, which is expected to be a vector of strings.\n2. **Filtering:** \n   -  We use the `filter` function to iterate over each word (`x`) in the `words` vector.  \n   - The `filter` function keeps only the elements for which the provided function returns `true`.  \n3. **Predicate Function:**\n   - The predicate function `x -> startswith(x, uppercase(x[1]))` checks if a word starts with a capital letter:\n     - `x[1]` accesses the first character of the word `x`.\n     - `uppercase(x[1])` converts the first character to uppercase.\n     - `startswith(x, uppercase(x[1]))` checks if the word `x` starts with its uppercase first character.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe function effectively iterates through the list of words and keeps only those words where the first character, when converted to uppercase, is equal to the first character of the word itself. This identifies words that start with a capital letter.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks you'd like to solve!","status":200,"tokens":[340,321],"elapsed":0.878794625,"cost":0.00013220000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":664853685,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
