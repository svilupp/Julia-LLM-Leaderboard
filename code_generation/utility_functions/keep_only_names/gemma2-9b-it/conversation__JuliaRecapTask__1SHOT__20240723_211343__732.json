[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Okay, here is the Julia function to achieve that:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n  return words .|> filter(isfirst.(.) .!)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})` defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. **Filtering with `filter`:**\n   - `words |> filter(isfirst.(.) .!)` pipes the input `words` through the filter function.\n\n3. **`isfirst` and `.!` operators:**\n   - `isfirst.(.)` checks if the first character of each string in the vector is uppercase.\n   - The `.!` operator inverts the boolean result, so we keep strings where the first character is *not* uppercase.\n\n4. **Return Value:**\n   - The function returns a new vector containing only the strings that passed the filter.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want to test it with some example words!","status":200,"tokens":[340,244],"elapsed":2.082024208,"cost":0.00011679999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-544673970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
