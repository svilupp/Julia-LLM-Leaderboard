[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n  return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(headstring(word)))]\nend\n```\n\n###  Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})` defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a single argument `words`, annotated as a vector of abstract strings.\n\n2. **List Comprehension:**\n   - `[word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(headstring(word)))]` uses a list comprehension to efficiently filter the input `words` vector. \n   - It iterates through each `word` in the `words` vector.\n   - For each `word`, it checks if it starts with a capital letter using `startswith(word, uppercase(headstring(word)))`.\n     - `headstring(word)` extracts the first character of the `word`.\n     - `uppercase(headstring(word))` converts the first character to uppercase.\n     - `startswith(word, ...)` checks if the entire `word` starts with the uppercase first character.\n\n3. **Return Value:**\n   - The list comprehension builds a new vector containing only the `word` that pass the condition (start with a capital letter). This new vector is returned by the function.\n\n\n\n Let me know if you'd like to explore variations or test it with some examples!","status":200,"tokens":[341,323],"elapsed":0.912884166,"cost":0.00013279999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":141789220,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
