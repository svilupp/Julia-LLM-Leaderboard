[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n  return filter(is_capitalized_first, words)\nend\n\nfunction is_capitalized_first(word::AbstractString)\n  return word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`keep_only_names` Function:**\n   - Takes a single argument `words` which is a vector of strings.\n   - Uses the `filter` function to iterate through each word in `words`.\n   - Passes each word to the `is_capitalized_first` function to check if it starts with a capital letter.\n   - Returns a new vector containing only the words that return `true` from `is_capitalized_first` (i.e., words starting with a capital letter).\n\n2. **`is_capitalized_first` Function:**\n   - Takes a single argument `word` which is a string.\n   - Checks if the first character of the `word` (`word[1]`) is within the uppercase alphabet range ('A' to 'Z').\n   - Returns `true` if the first character is uppercase, indicating a name, otherwise returns `false`.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Type Annotations:** We use `AbstractString` for type annotations to allow flexibility with strings and avoid unnecessary type constraints.\n- **`filter` Function:** The `filter` function efficiently iterates and selects elements based on a provided condition.\n- **Character Indexing:** We use `word[1]` to access the first character of the string.\n- **Uppercase Range Check:** `word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'` checks if the first character falls within the uppercase alphabet range.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or questions.","status":200,"tokens":[340,404],"elapsed":1.123706875,"cost":0.00014879999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1614849061,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
