If they are the same, it means the word starts with a capital letter and `isnamed` returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   The `keep_only_names` function filters the input words using the `isnamed` function.\n*   The `isnamed` function checks if each word starts with a capital letter by comparing its first character with its uppercase version.\n*   Only words that start with a capital letter pass the `isnamed` check and are included in the output vector.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[69,396],"elapsed":1.046928709,"cost":9.3e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1832209021,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
