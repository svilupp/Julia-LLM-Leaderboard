[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n  return filter(is_startcapital, words)\nend\n\nfunction is_startcapital(word::AbstractString)\n  return word[1] == upper(word[1])\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Function Definition:**\n    *   `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})` defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2.  **Filtering:**\n    *   `return filter(is_startcapital, words)` utilizes the `filter` function to iterate through each `word` in the `words` vector.\n    *   For each `word`, it calls the `is_startcapital` function. If `is_startcapital` returns `true`, the word is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\n3.  **`is_startcapital` Function:**\n    *   `function is_startcapital(word::AbstractString)` defines a helper function to check if a word starts with a capital letter.\n    *   `word[1] == upper(word[1])` compares the first character of the `word` (`word[1]`) with its uppercased version (`upper(word[1])`). This determines if the first character is a capital letter.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see examples of how to use this function!","status":200,"tokens":[340,322],"elapsed":0.880045167,"cost":0.0001324,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-195879172,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
