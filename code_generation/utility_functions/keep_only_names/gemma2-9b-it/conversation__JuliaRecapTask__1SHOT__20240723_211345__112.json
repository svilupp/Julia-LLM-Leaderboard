[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return filter(isupper(first), words)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - `function keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}`: This defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new vector of strings. \n\n2. **Filtering:**\n   - `filter(isupper(first), words)`: This is the core of the function. \n     - `isupper(first)`: Checks if the first character of each string in `words` is uppercase.\n     - `filter`:  This function iterates over each element in `words`. For each element, it applies `isupper(first)`. If the result is `true`, the element is included in the output vector; otherwise, it's excluded.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe function leverages Julia's built-in filtering functionality. It efficiently iterates through the input list of words and keeps only those that meet the condition of starting with an uppercase letter.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or questions!","status":200,"tokens":[340,272],"elapsed":1.8622375,"cost":0.0001224,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":18687379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
