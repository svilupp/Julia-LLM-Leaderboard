[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'  # Checking if the first character is a capital letter\n            push!(filtered_words, word)  # Pushing words that start with a capital to filtered_words array\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe provided function `keep_only_names` takes in a list of words and iterates over each word. It checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter (using the condition `word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'`). If it is, the word is added to an array called `filtered_words`. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` array, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[379,219],"elapsed":8.462813125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
