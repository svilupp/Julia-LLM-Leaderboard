[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the task keeping only capitalized words:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filtered = AbstractString[]\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end \n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- Define function with `words` argument that is a vector of abstract strings\n- Create empty vector `filtered` to store capitalized words \n- Iterate over `words` vector\n- Check word is not empty and first letter is uppercase with `isuppercase`\n- If so, push word to `filtered` vector \n- Return the `filtered` vector\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[335,177],"elapsed":8.097305583,"cost":0.006928,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14281,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
