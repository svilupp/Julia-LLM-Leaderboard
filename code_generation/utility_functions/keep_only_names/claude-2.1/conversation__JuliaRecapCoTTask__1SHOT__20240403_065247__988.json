[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    result = AbstractString[]\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(result, word) \n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- `words` is specified to be a `Vector{AbstractString}` to allow different concrete string types\n- Initialize empty `result` array to store words starting with uppercase \n- Iterate over `words` vector\n- Check word is non-empty and first letter isuppercase using `isuppercase` \n- If so, `push!` word to `result`\n- Return the `result` vector\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[336,183],"elapsed":7.933646541,"cost":0.0070799999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30359,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
