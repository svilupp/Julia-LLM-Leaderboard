The syntax is quite idiomatic Julia, making use of functions like `isuppercase` and `first` to elegantly check the case and initial letter.","status":200,"tokens":[101,279],"elapsed":12.595259666,"cost":0.007504,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14713,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
