[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to keep only words that start with a capital letter from a list of words:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nTo explain the key steps:\n\n1. Define empty result array to hold words starting with capital letter\n2. Iterate over each word in input words list \n3. Check if first letter is uppercase using `isuppercase`\n4. If yes, append that word to result \n5. Return result array\n\nLet's test it on the sample data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nWhich is the expected result, keeping only the words starting with a capital letter.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples to test!","status":200,"tokens":[184,241],"elapsed":10.451135292,"cost":0.007256,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30861,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
