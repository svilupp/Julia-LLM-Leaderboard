[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered, word) \n        end\n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n- Take in a vector (`Array{String}`) of words called `words`\n- Create an empty `String` array to store the filtered words\n- Iterate over each `word` in `words`\n- Check if the word is not empty and if the first letter is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))` \n- If true, push that word to the filtered array\n- Return the filtered words array\n\nTo handle any special instructions, I will update the implementation accordingly. Please provide the list of words (`words`) as well when testing this function.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[336,226],"elapsed":9.30332725,"cost":0.008112,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14458,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
