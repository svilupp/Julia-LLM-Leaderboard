[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String, 1})\n    result = String[]\n    for word in words\n        startswithuppercase(char) = isuppercase(first(char))\n        if startswithuppercase(word)\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis iterates over the `words` array and checks if each word `startswithuppercase`. If so, it pushes the word to a result array. Finally it returns the result array containing only capitalized words.\n\nI used a separate `startswithuppercase` function to abstract that logic for clarity and reuse. I also used more specific types like `Array{String, 1}` and `String` instead of just `Array` and `AbstractString` to be a bit more strict on the expected inputs and outputs.\n\nLet me know if you have any other special instructions to consider or changes to the implementation! I'm happy to update my solution.","status":200,"tokens":[336,208],"elapsed":10.339740291,"cost":0.007679999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13266,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
