[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to keep only capitalized words in a list of words in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- Define function with `words` as a `Vector{String}` input \n- Create empty `filtered` vector to hold capitalized words\n- Loop through each `word` in `words` \n- Check if `word` is not empty and if `first(word)` is uppercase using `isuppercase`\n- If so, push that `word` to the `filtered` vector\n- Return the `filtered` vector of capitalized words\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Banana\", \"car\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n# Returns [\"Cat\", \"Banana\"]\n```\n\nI used Julia base functions like `isuppercase`, `first`, `push!`, avoided any external packages, and emphasized clarity and performance. Let me know if you have any other requirements for the function!","status":200,"tokens":[335,282],"elapsed":12.843803875,"cost":0.009448000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11801,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
