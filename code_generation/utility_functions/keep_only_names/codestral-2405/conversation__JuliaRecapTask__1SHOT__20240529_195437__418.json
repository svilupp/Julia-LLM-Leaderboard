[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return words\nend\n\n# Test\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]))\n```\n\nIn this solution, we define a function `keep_only_names` which takes a vector of strings as input. We then use the `filter!` function to modify the input vector in-place, keeping only the words that start with an uppercase letter. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of a word is uppercase. Finally, we return the modified vector.\n\nThe `filter!` function modifies the input vector in-place, which is more efficient than creating a new vector. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is an uppercase letter. The `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` is an anonymous function that takes a word as input and returns `true` if the first character of the word is uppercase. The `filter!` function applies this function to each word in the input vector and keeps only the words for which the function returns `true`.\n\nThe test at the end of the code checks that the function works correctly by printing the result of calling `keep_only_names` on a test vector.","status":200,"tokens":[370,306],"elapsed":2.191523667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1743307157,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
