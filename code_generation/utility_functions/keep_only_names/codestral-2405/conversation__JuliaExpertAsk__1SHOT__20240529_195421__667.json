The `filter!` function applies the provided predicate function to each element of the vector and removes elements for which the predicate function returns `false`. In this case, the predicate function is `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` which returns `true` if the first character of the word is uppercase and `false` otherwise. This effectively removes all words that do not start with a capital letter from the vector.","status":200,"tokens":[104,155],"elapsed":1.113398875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-633467871,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
