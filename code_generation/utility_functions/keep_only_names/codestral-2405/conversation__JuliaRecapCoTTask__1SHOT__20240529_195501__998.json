[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Bird\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nIn this solution, the function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings as input and uses the `filter!` function to modify the vector in-place. The `filter!` function keeps only the words that satisfy the given condition, which is that the first character of the word is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if a character is uppercase. The function returns nothing, as it modifies the input vector directly.\n\nThe test case creates a vector of words, calls the function `keep_only_names` on it, and then prints the updated vector. The expected output is `[\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]`, as the word \"dog\" has been removed from the vector.","status":200,"tokens":[372,258],"elapsed":1.846693959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1097713264,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
