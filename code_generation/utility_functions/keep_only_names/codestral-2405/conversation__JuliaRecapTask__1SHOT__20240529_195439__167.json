[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` as input. It filters the vector based on a predicate function, which checks if the first character of the word is uppercased. The `filter` function returns a new vector containing only the elements for which the predicate function returns true. This way, it keeps only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[370,206],"elapsed":1.507383541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":942350036,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
