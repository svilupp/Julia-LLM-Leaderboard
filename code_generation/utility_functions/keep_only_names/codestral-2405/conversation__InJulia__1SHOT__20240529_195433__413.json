I will write a Julia function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to create a new list (`filtered_words`) that contains only the words from the original list (`words`) that satisfy the condition specified in the anonymous function (`word -> isuppercase(first(word))`). The condition checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words as an argument to get the filtered list of words. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThe function successfully removes the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" from the list because they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[63,308],"elapsed":2.126104083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1479907584,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
