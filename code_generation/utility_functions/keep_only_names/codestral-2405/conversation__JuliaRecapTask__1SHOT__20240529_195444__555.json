[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector containing only those words that start with a capital letter. The `filter` function is a higher-order function that constructs a new collection containing elements for which a given predicate function returns `true`. In this case, the predicate function is `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[370,163],"elapsed":1.214091042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":443468521,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
