The `filter` function is used with a condition that checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. The function returns the filtered list of words.\n\nThe function is then tested with the provided data. The expected output is `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`, which the function correctly produces.","status":200,"tokens":[194,179],"elapsed":2.458005667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":822136955,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
