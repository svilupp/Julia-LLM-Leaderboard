Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter!(word-> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter!` function to modify the `words` array in-place. The function passed to `filter!` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If the first character is not uppercase, the word will be removed from the `words` array.","status":200,"tokens":[104,139],"elapsed":1.012636458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-877710774,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
