The `filter` function takes a predicate function as its first argument, which is the function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` in this case. This predicate function checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase. If it is, the word is included in the output. If it's not, the word is excluded from the output.","status":200,"tokens":[63,156],"elapsed":1.135325875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1847551343,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
