Here's a simple function in Julia that does that:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `filter` function, which takes a function and a collection as arguments, and returns a collection that includes only the elements for which the function returns `true`. The function we pass to `filter` is `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`, which checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase. If it is, the function returns `true`, and the word is included in the output; if not, the function returns `false`, and the word is excluded from the output.","status":200,"tokens":[63,164],"elapsed":1.18173675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":480723344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
