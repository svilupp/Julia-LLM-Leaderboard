The `filter` function performs this by testing each string `word` from `words` with the function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of `word` (`word[1]`) is uppercase (`isuppercase(word[1])`). If the test is true, `filter` includes `word` in the new array.","status":200,"tokens":[63,191],"elapsed":1.403249125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1708913857,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
