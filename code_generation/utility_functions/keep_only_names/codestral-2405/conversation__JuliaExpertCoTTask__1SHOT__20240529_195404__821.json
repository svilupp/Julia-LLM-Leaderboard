It keeps only the words that start with a capital letter by checking if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. The filtered list of words is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[194,170],"elapsed":1.242785959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1006069372,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
