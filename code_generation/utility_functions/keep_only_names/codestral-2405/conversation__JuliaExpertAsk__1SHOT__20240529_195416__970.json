Here's a simple function in Julia that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter!(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter!` function to modify the `words` array in-place. The `filter!` function keeps only the elements of the array for which the provided function returns `true`. In this case, the function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[104,150],"elapsed":1.08797925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1214853149,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
