The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first letter of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept in the vector; if not, it is removed.","status":200,"tokens":[104,133],"elapsed":1.021927584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":515655162,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
