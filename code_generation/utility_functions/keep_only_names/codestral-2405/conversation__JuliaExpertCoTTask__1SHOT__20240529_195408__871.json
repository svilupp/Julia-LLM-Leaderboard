If the first character is uppercase, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list.\n\nThe provided test case checks if the function works correctly by asserting that the output of `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])` is equal to `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[194,208],"elapsed":1.487882083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":518572163,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
