Here's a simple Julia function that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list of words to only keep those that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `filter` function to create a new list that only includes words for which the given condition is true. The condition is that the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase, which we check using the `isuppercase` function.","status":200,"tokens":[63,153],"elapsed":1.120034958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":71470287,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
