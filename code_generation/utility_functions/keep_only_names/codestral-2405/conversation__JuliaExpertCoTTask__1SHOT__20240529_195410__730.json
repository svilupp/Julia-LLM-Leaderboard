The `filter` function is used to iterate over the words and keep only those that satisfy the given condition, which is that the first character of the word is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if a character is uppercase, and `first` is used to get the first character of a string.\n\nYou can use this function with the provided data as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[194,232],"elapsed":1.750194333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1714255604,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
