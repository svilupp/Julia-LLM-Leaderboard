[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I will write a function `keep_only_names` that iterates over the provided list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter. The function will use a filtering mechanism to keep only the words that satisfy the condition.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of words as input. The `filter` function is used to create a new vector that contains only the elements of the original vector for which the provided function returns `true`. In this case, the function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` checks if the first character of the word is uppercase and returns `true` if it is.\n\nLet's test this function with some example data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Fish\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThe output should be `[\"Dog\", \"Fish\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[372,264],"elapsed":1.878890458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":201122503,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
