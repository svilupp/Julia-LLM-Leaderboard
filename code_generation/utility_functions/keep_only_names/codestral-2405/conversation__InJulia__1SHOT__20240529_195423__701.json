The predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value. In this case, the predicate is `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[63,171],"elapsed":1.2108745,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":406587641,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
