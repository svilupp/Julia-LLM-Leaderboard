[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. We initialize an empty vector `filtered` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each `word` in the input `words` using a `for` loop.\n4. For each `word`, we check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we `push!` the `word` into the `filtered` vector.\n6. After iterating over all words, we return the `filtered` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThis function uses the `isuppercase` function from the `Base` module to check if a character is uppercase. It iterates over the input vector and filters out the words that don't satisfy the condition of starting with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of strings, for example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[350,343],"elapsed":7.639048209,"cost":0.006195,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22563,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
