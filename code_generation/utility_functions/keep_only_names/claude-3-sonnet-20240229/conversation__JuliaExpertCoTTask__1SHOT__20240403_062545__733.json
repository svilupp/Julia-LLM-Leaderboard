[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nTo test:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `keep_only_names` function takes a list `words` as input.\n- It uses the `filter` function to create a new list containing only the words that satisfy the condition `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the `word` is an uppercase letter.\n- The filtered list is returned as the result.\n\nThis solution follows a functional programming approach, using the built-in `filter` function to create a new list based on the specified condition.","status":200,"tokens":[181,210],"elapsed":5.418436458,"cost":0.003693,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32355,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
