We initialize an empty array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. We iterate over each `word` in the `words` array using a `for` loop.\n3. For each `word`, we check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, we append the `word` to the `names` array using `push!(names, word)`.\n5. After iterating over all words, we return the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Using `isuppercase(word[1])` to check if the first character of a word is uppercase.\n- Using `push!(names, word)` to append words to the `names` array.\n- Returning the `names` array after iterating over all words.","status":200,"tokens":[181,329],"elapsed":5.858284583,"cost":0.005478,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12728,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
