If the condition is true, `push!(kept_words, word)` adds the current word to the `kept_words` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After iterating over all words, the function `return kept_words` to return the array of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmy_words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(my_words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the list `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]`, and it returns a new list `[\"Apple\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,397],"elapsed":6.768914958,"cost":0.006141000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15975,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
