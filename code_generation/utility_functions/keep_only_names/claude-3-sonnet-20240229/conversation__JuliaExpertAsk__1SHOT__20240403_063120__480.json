It uses the `filter` function along with an anonymous function to keep only those words that start with a capital letter. The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches any word that starts with an uppercase letter from A to Z. The `occursin` function checks if the regular expression pattern occurs in each word. The `filter` function returns a new collection containing only the words for which the anonymous function returns `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,154],"elapsed":3.666513042,"cost":0.002607,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25319,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
