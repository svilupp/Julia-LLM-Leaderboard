We create an empty array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. We iterate over each word in the input list `words` using a `for` loop.\n3. For each word, we check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function and indexing the first character (`word[1]`).\n4. If the first character is uppercase, we add the word to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After iterating over all words, we return the `names` array.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a list of words `words` and pass it to the `keep_only_names` function. The function returns a new array `names` containing only the words that start with a capital letter, which we print to the console.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `words` is an array or another iterable collection of strings. If you need to handle other data types or different capitalization rules, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[62,426],"elapsed":8.6107505,"cost":0.006576,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4489,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
