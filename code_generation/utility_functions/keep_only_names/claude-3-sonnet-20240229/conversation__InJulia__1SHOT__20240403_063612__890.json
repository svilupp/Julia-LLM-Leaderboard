We define a new function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of strings `words` as input.\n2. We initialize an empty array `names` to store the filtered words.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each `word` in the `words` list.\n4. For each `word`, we check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we add the `word` to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n6. After iterating over all the words, we return the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Orange\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function filters out the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" because they don't start with a capital letter, and returns the remaining words \"Apple\", \"Orange\", and \"Cat\".","status":200,"tokens":[62,367],"elapsed":7.347307542,"cost":0.005691000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7377,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
