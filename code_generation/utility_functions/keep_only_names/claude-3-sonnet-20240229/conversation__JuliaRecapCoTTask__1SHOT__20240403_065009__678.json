[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution defines a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings `words` as input. It uses the `filter` function from the standard library, which creates a new collection by removing elements that do not satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe condition is specified as an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`. Here, `word` represents each element of the input vector `words`. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word, `word[1]`, is an uppercase letter. If the condition is true, the word is kept in the resulting collection; otherwise, it is filtered out.\n\nThe `filter` function returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"date\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]\n```\n\nThis will print `[\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]`, as these are the only words in the input list that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: If you don't provide any special instructions, the solution follows the general guidelines, including preferring standard libraries, using type annotations, and emphasizing performance and clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[350,329],"elapsed":7.866369583,"cost":0.005985,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5435,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
