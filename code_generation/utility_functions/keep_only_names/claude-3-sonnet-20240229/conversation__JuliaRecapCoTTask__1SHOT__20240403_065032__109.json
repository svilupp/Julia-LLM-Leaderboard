[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to keep only words that start with a capital letter in a given list of words:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Car\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # prints [\"Apple\", \"Car\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nHere's how the `keep_only_names` function works:\n\n1. It initializes an empty array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. It iterates over each `word` in the input `words` array using a `for` loop.\n3. For each `word`, it checks if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, it appends the `word` to the `names` array using `push!(names, word)`.\n5. After iterating over all words, it returns the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote that this function assumes the input `words` is an array of strings. If the input has a different data structure, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[350,333],"elapsed":7.226457125,"cost":0.006045,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17094,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
