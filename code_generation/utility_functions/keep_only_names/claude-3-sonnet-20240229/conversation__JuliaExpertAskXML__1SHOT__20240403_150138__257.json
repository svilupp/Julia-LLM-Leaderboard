Here's how it works:\n\n1. `filter(func, collection)` is a built-in Julia function that returns a new collection containing only the elements of `collection` for which `func` returns `true`.\n2. The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function.\n3. The `filter` function applies this anonymous function to each element of the `words` list and returns a new list containing only the words for which the condition is true (i.e., words starting with a capital letter).","status":200,"tokens":[104,198],"elapsed":3.664182292,"cost":0.003282,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3907,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
