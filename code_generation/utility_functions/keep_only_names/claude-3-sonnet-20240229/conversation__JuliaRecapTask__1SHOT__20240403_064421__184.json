[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from the provided list `words` that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    names = AbstractString[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of `AbstractString` elements as input.\n2. Inside the function, we initialize an empty vector `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each `word` in the input `words` vector using a `for` loop.\n4. For each `word`, we check if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase(word[1])` condition.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` vector.\n6. After iterating over all words, we `return` the `names` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"dog\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis will create a new vector `names` containing only the words that start with a capital letter, leaving out \"dog\" and \"elephant\" from the original `words` vector.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that a \"name\" is defined as a word starting with a capital letter. If you have different rules for determining a name, you can modify the condition inside the `if` statement accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[349,416],"elapsed":9.066910458,"cost":0.007287,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":45,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
