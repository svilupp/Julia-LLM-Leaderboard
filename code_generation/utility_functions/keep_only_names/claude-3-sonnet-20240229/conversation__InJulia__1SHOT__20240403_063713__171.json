We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words `words` as input.\n2. We create an empty list `filtered_words` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each word in the `words` list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each word, we check if the first character `word[1]` is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we add (or `push!`) the word to the `filtered_words` list.\n6. After iterating over all the words, we return the `filtered_words` list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]`, and it returns a new list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\"]` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,394],"elapsed":6.379212458,"cost":0.006096000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24536,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
