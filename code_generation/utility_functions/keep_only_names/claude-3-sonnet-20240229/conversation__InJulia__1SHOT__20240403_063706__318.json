The function `keep_only_names` takes a single argument `words`, which is expected to be a collection (e.g., an array or vector) of strings.\n2. Inside the function, we create an empty `String` array called `names` using `names = String[]`. This array will hold the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each `word` in the `words` collection.\n4. For each `word`, we check if the first character (`word[1]`) is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, we add the `word` to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After the loop finishes, the `names` array will contain all the words from the original `words` collection that start with a capital letter.\n6. Finally, we return the `names` array.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"orange\", \"Pear\", \"Kiwi\", \"grape\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Kiwi\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an array `words` containing a mix of words with and without capital letters. We then call the `keep_only_names` function with `words` as the argument, and it returns a new array `names` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input `words` is a collection of strings. If it's a single string, you would need to split it into individual words first, e.g., using the `split` function.","status":200,"tokens":[62,494],"elapsed":9.1350085,"cost":0.007596,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19472,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
