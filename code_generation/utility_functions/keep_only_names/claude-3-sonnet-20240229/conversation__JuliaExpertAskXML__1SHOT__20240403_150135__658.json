The anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. The `filter` function returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the anonymous function returns `true`.\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmy_words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Orange\", \"pear\", \"Kiwi\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(my_words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Kiwi\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` will remove the words \"banana\" and \"pear\" from the list because they don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[104,253],"elapsed":4.685050834,"cost":0.004107,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11910,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
