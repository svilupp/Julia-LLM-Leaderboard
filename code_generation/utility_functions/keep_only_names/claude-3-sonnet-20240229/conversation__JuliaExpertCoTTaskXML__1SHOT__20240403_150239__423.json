Create an empty array to store capitalized words\n2. Loop through each word in the input array\n3. Check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`\n4. If so, add the word to the capitalized words array using `push!`\n5. After the loop, return the array of capitalized words\n\nThis filters the input list to contain only words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[215,362],"elapsed":7.345187709,"cost":0.006075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9546,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
