[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list `words` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `filter` function from Julia's standard library. `filter` applies a given condition/predicate to each element of a collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n3. The condition/predicate we provide is an anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])`. This checks if the first character of each `word` is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n4. `filter` returns a new list containing only the words that start with an uppercase letter.\n5. This filtered list is returned by the `keep_only_names` function.\n\nTherefore, `keep_only_names` will return a new list containing only the words from the original `words` list that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Car\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Car\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis solution uses a concise and idiomatic Julia approach, leveraging the built-in `filter` function and an anonymous function as the predicate. It is efficient and readable.","status":200,"tokens":[350,339],"elapsed":7.910285417,"cost":0.006135,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17889,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
