Initialize empty array `names` to store the filtered words \n2. Iterate through each `word` in `words`\n3. Check if the first character of `word` is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`\n4. If so, `push!` the `word` into `names`\n5. After the loop, `return names`\n\nThis filters the list to only contain words starting with an uppercase letter, which is a common convention for proper names in English.","status":200,"tokens":[215,302],"elapsed":6.137009542,"cost":0.005175,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26731,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
