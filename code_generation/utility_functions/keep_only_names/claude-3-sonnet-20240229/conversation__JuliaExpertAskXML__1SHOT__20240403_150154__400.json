We initialize an empty `String` array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. We iterate over each `word` in the provided `words` array.\n3. For each `word`, we check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` array.\n5. After iterating through all words, we return the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[104,194],"elapsed":3.717519708,"cost":0.003222,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7483,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
