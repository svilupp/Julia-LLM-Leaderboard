An empty array `filtered_words` is created to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. The function iterates over each word in the input list `words` using a `for` loop.\n3. For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function and the indexing `word[1]`.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After iterating over all words, the `filtered_words` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`. It removes the word `\"cat\"` because it doesn't start with a capital letter, and returns the filtered list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,392],"elapsed":7.870651042,"cost":0.006066,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2714,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
