An empty array `names` is initialized to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. The function iterates over each word in the `words` list using a `for` loop.\n3. For each word, it checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function and the indexing expression `word[1]`.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After iterating over all words, the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `words` is a list of strings. If you need to handle other data types or have additional requirements, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[62,387],"elapsed":6.360845208,"cost":0.005991000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27529,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
