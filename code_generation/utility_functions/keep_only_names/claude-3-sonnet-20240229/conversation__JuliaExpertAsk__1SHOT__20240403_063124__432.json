It uses the `filter` function to create a new list containing only the words that start with an uppercase letter. The anonymous function `w -> isuppercase(w[1])` is used as the filter condition, where `w[1]` returns the first character of the word `w`, and `isuppercase` checks if that character is an uppercase letter. The `filter` function applies this condition to each word in the input `words` list and returns a new list containing only the words that satisfy the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[99,169],"elapsed":3.783685125,"cost":0.002832,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
