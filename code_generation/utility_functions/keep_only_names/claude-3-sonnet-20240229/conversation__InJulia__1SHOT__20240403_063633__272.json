An empty array `filtered_words` of type `String` is created to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n2. The function iterates over each `word` in the provided list `words` using a `for` loop.\n3. For each `word`, it checks if the first character (`word[1]`) is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase` function.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, the `word` is added to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function.\n5. After iterating over all words, the function returns the `filtered_words` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]`, and it returns a new list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\"]` containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[62,372],"elapsed":7.584683083,"cost":0.005766,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24049,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
