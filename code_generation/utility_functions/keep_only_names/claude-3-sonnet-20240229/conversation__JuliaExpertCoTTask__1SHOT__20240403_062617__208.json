We initialize an empty array `names` to store the words starting with a capital letter.\n2. We iterate over each `word` in the input `words` array.\n3. For each `word`, we check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n4. If the condition is true, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` array.\n5. After iterating over all words, we return the `names` array containing only the words starting with a capital letter.\n\nThis function follows a straightforward approach:\n\n- Think through your approach step by step: Iterate over the input words, check if each word starts with a capital letter, and store the words that meet the condition in a new array.\n- Write any functions and other code you need: The `keep_only_names` function is implemented.\n- Solve the task: The function correctly keeps only words starting with a capital letter.\n- Check that your solution is correct: The test case with `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]` confirms the expected output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,389],"elapsed":8.372008708,"cost":0.006378,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10109,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
