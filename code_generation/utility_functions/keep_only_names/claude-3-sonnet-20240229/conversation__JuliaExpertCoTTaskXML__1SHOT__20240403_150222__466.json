Create an empty array `names` to store words starting with a capital letter\n2. Iterate over `words` with a `for` loop\n3. Check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase with `isuppercase`\n4. If so, `push!` the word into the `names` array\n5. After the loop, `return` the `names` array","status":200,"tokens":[215,304],"elapsed":5.730664125,"cost":0.0052049999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27708,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
