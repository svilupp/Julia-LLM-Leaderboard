[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector/array of strings `words` as input.\n2. We use the `filter` function from Julia's base to create a new vector/array containing only the words that satisfy the given condition.\n3. The condition `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of each `word` is an uppercase letter.\n4. `filter` iterates over each `word` in `words`, and includes it in the output vector/array only if the condition is true.\n5. The resulting vector/array contains only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\"]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input `words` vector/array, since `filter` has to iterate over all elements once. It has a space complexity of O(m), where m is the number of words that start with a capital letter, since a new vector/array of that size is created to store the filtered words.\n\nNote: If you need to modify the original `words` vector/array in-place instead of creating a new one, you can use a combination of `filter!` and `deleteat!` functions. However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[350,382],"elapsed":7.980110291,"cost":0.00678,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6770,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
