We define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. We initialize an empty array `names` to store the words starting with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each word in the input list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each word, we check if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n5. If the condition is true (the word starts with a capital letter), we add the word to the `names` array using `push!(names, word)`.\n6. After iterating over all words, we return the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nThis function follows a systematic approach:\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step.\n2. Define the function and initialize an empty array to store the names.\n3. Iterate over the input list of words.\n4. Check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n5. If it does, add it to the `names` array.\n6. Return the `names` array after iterating over all words.\n\nThe solution checks that each word starts with a capital letter before adding it to the `names` array, effectively removing all words that do not meet this condition.","status":200,"tokens":[181,428],"elapsed":8.162763542,"cost":0.0069630000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-54,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
