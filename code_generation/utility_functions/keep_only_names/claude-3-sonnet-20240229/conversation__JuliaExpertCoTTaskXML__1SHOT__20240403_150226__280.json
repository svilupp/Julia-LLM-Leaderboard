Create an empty array `names` to store the filtered words\n2. Loop through each `word` in the input `words` list\n3. Check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase with `isuppercase`\n4. If so, `push!` the `word` onto the `names` array\n5. After the loop, `return` the `names` array\n\nThis filters the list to contain only words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[215,293],"elapsed":4.867162708,"cost":0.00504,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32152,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
