The function takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. It initializes an empty array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. It iterates over each `word` in the `words` list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each `word`, it checks if the first character is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`. The `word[1]` expression retrieves the first character of the word as a string, and `isuppercase` is a built-in function that checks if a character is uppercase.\n5. If the first character of the `word` is uppercase, it means the word starts with a capital letter, so the `word` is added to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n6. After iterating over all words, the function returns the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function is called with the list `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`. The function removes the word \"cat\" because it doesn't start with a capital letter, and returns an array containing the remaining words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[62,481],"elapsed":8.643839625,"cost":0.0074010000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1083,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
