[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words `words` and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    names = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. We initialize an empty vector `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each `word` in the input `words` vector.\n4. Inside the loop, we check if the first character of `word` is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function and indexing `word[1]`.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` vector.\n6. After the loop finishes, we `return` the `names` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Mango\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"table\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Mango\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `keep_only_names` function removes the words \"banana\", \"dog\", and \"table\" from the input list because they don't start with a capital letter.\n\nNote that we use the `Vector{String}` type annotation for the `words` parameter to ensure that the input is a vector of strings. This is a good practice in Julia because it helps with type stability and performance. However, if you want to allow the function to accept any iterable collection of strings, you can use a more general type annotation like `AbstractVector{String}` or `AbstractArray{String}`.","status":200,"tokens":[349,472],"elapsed":10.637464583,"cost":0.008127,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
