The function takes a single argument `words`, which is a list of strings.\n2. An empty array `names` is initialized to store the names (words starting with a capital letter).\n3. The `for` loop iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n4. Inside the loop, the condition `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the current word is uppercase. `word[1]` accesses the first character of the string `word`.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the `names` array using the `push!` function.\n6. After iterating over all words, the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter is returned.\n\nNote that the `isuppercase` function in Julia checks if a character is an uppercase letter. If you need to consider other cases (e.g., words starting with non-letter characters), you may need to modify the condition accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[62,421],"elapsed":7.249957958,"cost":0.006501000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13611,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
