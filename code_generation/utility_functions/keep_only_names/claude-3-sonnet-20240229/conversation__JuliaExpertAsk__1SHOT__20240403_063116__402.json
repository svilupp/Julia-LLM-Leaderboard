The `filter` function applies this condition to each element of the `words` array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which the condition is true.","status":200,"tokens":[99,139],"elapsed":3.13871075,"cost":0.002382,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5124,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
