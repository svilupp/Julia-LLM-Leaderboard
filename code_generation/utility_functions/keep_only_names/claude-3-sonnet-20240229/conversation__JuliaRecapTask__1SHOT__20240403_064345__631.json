[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    names = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. An empty vector `names` is initialized to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The `for` loop iterates over each `word` in the `words` vector.\n4. The condition `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character of the current `word` is uppercase.\n5. If the condition is true, the `word` is added to the `names` vector using `push!(names, word)`.\n6. After iterating over all words, the `names` vector containing only the words starting with a capital letter is returned.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Elephant\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis will print the list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input `words` is a vector of strings. If the input is a different type, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[349,369],"elapsed":7.765229875,"cost":0.006582,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1870,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
