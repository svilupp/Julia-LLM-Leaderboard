We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. We initialize an empty vector `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter.\n3. We iterate over each `word` in the `words` vector using a `for` loop.\n4. For each `word`, we check if the first character `word[1]` is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n5. If the first character is uppercase, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` vector.\n6. After iterating over all words, we `return` the `names` vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nTo test the function:\n\n```julia\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe function correctly filters out the words \"banana\" and \"dog\" since they do not start with a capital letter, and returns the vector `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,345],"elapsed":5.419250458,"cost":0.005718,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28511,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
