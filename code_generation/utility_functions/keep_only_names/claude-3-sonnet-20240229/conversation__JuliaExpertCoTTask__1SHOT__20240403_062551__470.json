We create an empty array `names` to store the words starting with a capital letter.\n2. We loop through each `word` in the input list `words`.\n3. We check if the first character of the `word` is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n4. If the condition is true, we `push!` the `word` into the `names` array.\n5. After the loop finishes, we return the `names` array containing only the words starting with a capital letter.\n\nThe key steps are:\n- Iterating over the input list with a `for` loop.\n- Checking if the first character of each word is uppercase using `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- Building a new array `names` with the words satisfying the condition.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only keep the words starting with a capital letter and discard the rest.","status":200,"tokens":[181,344],"elapsed":6.229031459,"cost":0.005703000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7291,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
