X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here's how I would approach the task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Control structures: `if`\n   - String manipulation: `uppercase`\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(uppercase(word[1]), A:'Z')\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    result\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a new array containing only the strings that start with a capital letter. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each string in the input array, and an `if` statement to check if the first character of the string is a capital letter using the `startswith` and `uppercase` functions. If the condition is met, the string is added to the `result` array using the `push!` function. The function returns the `result` array at the end.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!","status":200,"tokens":[375,303],"elapsed":2.545442791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
