[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\nTo solve this task, we can use a combination of Julia's array comprehension and the `isuppercase` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nHere's how we can define the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input, iterates over each word, and checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, the word is included in the new array; otherwise, it is skipped.\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nTo verify that our solution works correctly, we can test it with a sample list of words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"bird\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[327,276],"elapsed":4.999748541,"cost":0.005775000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1653386285,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
