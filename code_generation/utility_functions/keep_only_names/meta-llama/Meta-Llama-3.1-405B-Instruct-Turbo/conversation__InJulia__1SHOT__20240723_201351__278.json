The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase, and `first` gets the first character of a string.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"house\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # prints [\"Dog\", \"Mouse\"]\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[68,162],"elapsed":3.127628417,"cost":0.00277,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":2103186009,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
