[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new array that only includes the words from the original array for which the first character is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input is an array of strings. If the input might be something else, you might want to add some error checking code to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[68,179],"elapsed":7.442909084,"cost":3.902e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1079084478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
