[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new array that includes only the words from the original array for which the first character is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\n```\n\nNote that this function considers \"elephant\" to be a name because it starts with a capital letter. If you want to consider only words that start with a capital letter and have at least one other capital letter, you can modify the function like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]) && any(c -> isuppercase(c), word[2:end]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses the `any` function to check if any character in the word (except the first one) is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[68,264],"elapsed":1.718602625,"cost":5.4319999999999995e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1666679141,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
