[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the words from the original list that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase, and `word[1]` gets the first character of a word.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list `words` is a list of strings. If the input list might contain other types of elements, you might want to add some error checking code to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[68,196],"elapsed":1.587066292,"cost":4.2080000000000004e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1607297250,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
