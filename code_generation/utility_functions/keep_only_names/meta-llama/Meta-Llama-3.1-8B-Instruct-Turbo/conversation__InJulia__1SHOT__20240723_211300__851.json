The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a certain character, and the `uppercase` function converts a string to uppercase. \n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # prints: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nNote that this function considers \"A\" as a capital letter, so it will keep words that start with \"A\" in any case. If you want to keep only words that start with a capital letter in the same case as the original word, you can use the following function instead:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a word is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[68,261],"elapsed":6.892116125,"cost":5.3780000000000003e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":834668723,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
