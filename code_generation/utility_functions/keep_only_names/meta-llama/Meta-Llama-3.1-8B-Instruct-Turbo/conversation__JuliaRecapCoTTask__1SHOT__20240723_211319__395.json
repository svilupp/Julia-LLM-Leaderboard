[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'll follow the guidelines and the special instructions to solve this task.\n\n## Step 1: Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\nTo solve this task, I'll need to use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of words, and a conditional statement to check if each word starts with a capital letter. I'll also use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a string is uppercase.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nHere's the Julia code that solves the task:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of words as input, and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nI'll test the function with a sample input to make sure it works correctly:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"bird\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\nThe function correctly removes the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[327,331],"elapsed":2.044292958,"cost":9.228e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1654314011,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
