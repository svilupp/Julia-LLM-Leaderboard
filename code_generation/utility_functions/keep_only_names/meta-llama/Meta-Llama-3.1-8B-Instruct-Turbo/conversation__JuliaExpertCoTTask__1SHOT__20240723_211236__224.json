Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Use the `filter` function to create a new list that only includes words that start with a capital letter.\n3. The condition for the filter is `startswith(x, uppercasefirst(x))`, which checks if the word `x` starts with the same character as the uppercase version of `x`.\n4. Call the function with the provided list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[177,145],"elapsed":1.35347925,"cost":4.38e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-270176599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
