[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'll follow the guidelines and the special instructions to solve this task.\n\n## Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nTo solve this task, I'll need to use the following Julia snippets:\n\n*   `for` loop to iterate over the list of words\n*   `if` statement to check if a word starts with a capital letter\n*   `push!` function to add words to a new list\n\n## Solve the Task\n\nHere's the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the words that start with a capital letter\n    names = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it does, add it to the list of names\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of names\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Bird\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\n## Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nI've double-checked the solution to ensure it's correct. The `keep_only_names` function iterates over the list of words, checks if each word starts with a capital letter using the `isuppercase` function, and adds it to the list of names if it does. The function returns the list of names, which is then printed to the console in the example usage.\n\nThe solution meets the requirements of the task and is efficient, clear, and concise.","status":200,"tokens":[327,361],"elapsed":2.560182542,"cost":9.768e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1485845700,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
