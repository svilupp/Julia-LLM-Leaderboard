The `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input.\n2. The `filter` function is used to create a new list that only includes the words that satisfy a certain condition.\n3. The condition is specified by the anonymous function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`, which checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n4. The resulting list of words that start with a capital letter is returned by the `keep_only_names` function.","status":200,"tokens":[177,165],"elapsed":3.31139775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1752287312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
