If it is, the word is included in the new list.\n* The resulting list is returned by the function.\n\nYou can test the function with a sample list of words, like this:\n```\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"hello\", \"World\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"World\"]\n```\nI hope this helps!
