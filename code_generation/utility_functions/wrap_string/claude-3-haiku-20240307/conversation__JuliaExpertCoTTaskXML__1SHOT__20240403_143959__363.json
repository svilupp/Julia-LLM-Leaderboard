It then iterates through the words, adding them to the current line. If adding the next word would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line. Finally, it joins the lines and returns the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[202,324],"elapsed":3.239685125,"cost":0.0004555,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26875,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
