It then iterates over the words, building up the current line of text. If adding the next word would cause the current line to exceed the maximum width, the current line is added to the `wrapped_text` list, and a new line is started.\n\nFinally, the function returns the wrapped text as a single string, with each line separated by a newline character (`\\n`).","status":200,"tokens":[94,415],"elapsed":3.926441667,"cost":0.00054225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1764,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
