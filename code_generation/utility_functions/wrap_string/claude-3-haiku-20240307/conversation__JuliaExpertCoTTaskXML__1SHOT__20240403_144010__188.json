Split the input text into a vector of words\n2. Initialize an empty vector to store the lines\n3. Iterate through the words, adding each word to the current line\n4. If adding the next word would exceed the maximum width, push the current line to the lines vector and start a new line\n5. After iterating through all words, push the final line to the lines vector\n6. Join the lines vector into a single string with newline characters in between\n\nThis ensures that the text is wrapped at the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[202,367],"elapsed":3.4708015,"cost":0.00050925,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22193,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
