Splits the input text into a vector of words using `split(text)`.\n2. Iterates through the words, adding each word to the current line if it fits, or starting a new line if it doesn't.\n3. Appends the final line to the list of lines.\n4. Joins the lines with newline characters and returns the resulting string.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's output, which wraps the input text into lines with a maximum width of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[202,383],"elapsed":3.6793035,"cost":0.0005292500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4974,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
