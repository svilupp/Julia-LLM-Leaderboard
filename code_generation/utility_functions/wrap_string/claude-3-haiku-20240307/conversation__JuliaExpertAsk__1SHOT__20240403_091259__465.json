It then splits the text into individual words, and iterates over the words, adding them to the current line as long as the line length doesn't exceed the `text_width`. When the line length would exceed the `text_width`, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new empty line is started. Finally, the function joins the lines back together with newline characters and returns the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[94,367],"elapsed":3.682688167,"cost":0.00048225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
