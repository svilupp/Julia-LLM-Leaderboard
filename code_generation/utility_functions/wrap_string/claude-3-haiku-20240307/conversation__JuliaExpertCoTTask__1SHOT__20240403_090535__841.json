The `wrap_string` function takes a `text` string and an optional `text_width` integer parameter (default is 10).\n2. The text is split into words using the `split` function.\n3. An empty array `lines` is initialized to store the wrapped lines.\n4. The `current_line` and `current_length` variables are initialized to keep track of the current line being built and its length.\n5. The code iterates through the words. For each word, it checks if adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it adds the current line to the `lines` array and starts a new line.\n6. The current word is then added to the `current_line` and the `current_length` is updated.\n7. After the loop, the last line is added to the `lines` array.\n8. Finally, the `lines` array is joined with newline characters and returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the `wrap_string` function in action, wrapping the provided text to fit within the default 10-character width.","status":200,"tokens":[168,617],"elapsed":5.945873375,"cost":0.0008132500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30726,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
