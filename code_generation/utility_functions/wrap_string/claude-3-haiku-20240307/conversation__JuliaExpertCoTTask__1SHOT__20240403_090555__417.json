I first split the input text into a list of words using `split(text)`.\n2. I initialize an empty list `lines` to store the wrapped lines, and an empty string `current_line` to build the current line.\n3. I iterate through the words. For each word, I check if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, I add the current line to the `lines` list and reset `current_line`.\n4. After the loop, if `current_line` is not empty, I add it to the `lines` list.\n5. Finally, I join the lines in the `lines` list using `join(lines, \"\\n\")` and return the result.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function with the given input text and the default `text_width` of 10.","status":200,"tokens":[168,397],"elapsed":3.763997209,"cost":0.0005382500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31840,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
