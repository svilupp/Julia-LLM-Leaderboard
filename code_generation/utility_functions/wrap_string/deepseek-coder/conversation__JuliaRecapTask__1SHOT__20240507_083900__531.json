[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If adding a word to the current line would exceed the maximum width, it adds the current line to the wrapped text with a newline character, and starts a new line with the current word. If the word fits on the current line, it is added to the current line. After all words have been processed, the current line is added to the wrapped text.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a test text to demonstrate the wrapping function.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a\ntest text\nto\ndemonstrate\nthe\nwrapping\nfunction.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[392,322],"elapsed":14.497916833,"cost":0.00014504,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2082937989,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
