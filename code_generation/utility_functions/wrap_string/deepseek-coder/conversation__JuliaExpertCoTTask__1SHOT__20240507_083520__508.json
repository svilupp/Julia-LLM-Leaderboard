If adding a word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the current line to the `wrapped_string` with a newline character, and starts a new line with the current word. After all words have been processed, it adds the remaining current line to the `wrapped_string`.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[187,294],"elapsed":10.673405667,"cost":0.00010850000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1619901505,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
