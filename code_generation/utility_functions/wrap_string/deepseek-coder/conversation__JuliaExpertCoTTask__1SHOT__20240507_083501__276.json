If adding a word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the current line to the `wrapped_string` with a newline character, and starts a new line with the current word. After going through all the words, it adds the last line to the `wrapped_string`.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[187,287],"elapsed":12.432315625,"cost":0.00010654000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1873565274,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
