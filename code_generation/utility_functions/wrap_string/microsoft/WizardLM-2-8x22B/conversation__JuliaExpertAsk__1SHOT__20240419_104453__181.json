The function will insert new lines (`\\n`) into the string to ensure that no line exceeds the given `text_width`. The default `text_width` is set to 10 characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            # If so, append the current line to `lines` and start a new line\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Otherwise, add the word to the current line\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Join all lines with new lines and return\n    join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"This is an example string that will be wrapped to fit within a specified width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, text_width=20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example, it will output the following:\n\n```\nThis is an example\nstring that will\nbe wrapped to fit\nwithin a specified\nwidth.\n```\n\nThis function splits the input text into words and then iteratively adds words to a line until adding another word would exceed the maximum line width. When the maximum width is reached, the current line is saved, and a new line is started. After processing all words, the function joins all the lines with new line characters and returns the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[103,487],"elapsed":29.85642,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1890736105,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
