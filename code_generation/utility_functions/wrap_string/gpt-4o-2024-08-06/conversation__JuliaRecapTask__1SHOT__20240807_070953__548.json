[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string input and wraps it such that no line exceeds a specified `text_width`, which defaults to 10 characters. We'll iterate over the words in the input string and construct lines, adding words until the next word would exceed our `text_width`. In such a case, we'll start a new line.\n\nHere's how we can do this in Julia:\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Tokenize the Input String:** Split the string into words separated by whitespace.\n2. **Line Construction:** Initialize an empty current line and iterate through each word.\n   - If adding a word to the current line exceeds `text_width`, append the current line to the result and start a new line with the current word.\n   - If it fits, append it to the current line.\n3. **Add Remaining Line:** After the iteration, ensure any remaining words in the current line are added to the output.\n4. **Return the Result:** Join the lines with newline characters and return it.\n\n### Useful Snippets:\n\n- String splitting in Julia can be done using `split(word_str)`.\n- Iteration over an array of words can be done using `for`.\n- String construction can use `join()` to format the output correctly.\n- String interpolation with `$`.\n\n### Julia Function Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input)  # Split the string into words\n    lines = []            # Array to hold lines of text\n    current_line = \"\"     # Initialize the current line\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the word would exceed the text width\n        if !isempty(current_line) && length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)  # Add current line to the lines\n            current_line = word         # Start a new line with the word\n        else\n            # Append the word to the current line\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"     # Add space between words\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")  # Join lines with newline characters\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_string = \"This is an example string that needs to be wrapped properly.\"\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(example_string, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_string)\n```\n\n### Double-check:\n\n- Ensure words are never split in the middle.\n- Confirm that the string splits on whitespace.\n- Non-breaking characters like spaces are correctly managed between words.\n- Check the correct handling of single long words (if a single word exceeds `text_width`).\n\nThe provided function splits words efficiently within the specified line width while preserving complete words, adhering to the problem constraints and expected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[315,620],"elapsed":7.39011675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1054310746,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
