If it does, it adds the `current_line` to the `lines` list and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it appends the word to the `current_line`.\n- At the end, any remaining words in `current_line` are added to `lines`, and then all lines are joined with a newline delimiter for the final result.\n\nThis code will wrap the input text into lines with a maximum width of 10 characters and print it.","status":200,"tokens":[162,590],"elapsed":7.006828458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":703670289,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
