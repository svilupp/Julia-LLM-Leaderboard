[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To address this task, we will create a function named `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum width as arguments. We'll split the input string into words, and then build a new string where each line does not exceed the specified `text_width`. This is analogous to word-wrapping functionality.\n\nHere are the steps I'll follow to implement this function:\n\n1. **Split the Input String:** We'll split the input string into words based on whitespace.\n2. **Iterate Over the Words:** We'll iterate over each word, keeping track of the current line length.\n3. **Check Length:** If adding another word would exceed the maximum width, we'll add a newline character and start a new line.\n4. **Building the Wrapped Text:** We'll accumulate words into the wrapped text according to the above logic.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int = 10)::AbstractString\n    # Split the input text into words\n    words = split(text)\n    # Initialize an empty result string and a variable to track the current line length\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the text width\n        if current_line_length + word_length + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"  # Add a newline if it exceeds\n            current_line_length = 0\n        elseif current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"  # Add a space between words if it's not the start of a line\n        end\n        \n        # Add the word to the current line\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is a simple example to demonstrate text wrapping functionality.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `split(text)` is used to divide the string into individual words.\n- In the loop, if adding a word exceeds `text_width`, a newline character is added.\n- The condition `(current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)` is used to account for spaces only between words, not before the first word.\n- The return value is the wrapped string.\n\n### Example Output:\n\nIf you run the example provided, the `println` will output the wrapped version of `example_text` with `text_width` of 10 characters per line. This function will help maintain the readability of text when dealing with limited-width displays or set constraints for text areas.","status":200,"tokens":[316,581],"elapsed":5.501694542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2100783978,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
