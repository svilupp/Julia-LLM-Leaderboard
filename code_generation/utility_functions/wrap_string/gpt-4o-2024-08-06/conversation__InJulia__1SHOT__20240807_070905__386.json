In Julia, you can write a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum text width as arguments, and outputs the text with line breaks inserted so that no line exceeds the specified width. Here is one way to implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_string::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_string)\n    wrapped_lines = String[]  # Array to hold each line of wrapped text\n    current_line = String[]   # Array to build the current line\n\n    current_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        # If adding the next word would exceed the text_width, form a new line\n        if current_length + length(word) + length(current_line) > text_width\n            # Append the current line to the wrapped lines\n            push!(wrapped_lines, join(current_line, \" \"))\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = [word]\n            current_length = length(word)\n        else\n            # Add the word to the current line\n            push!(current_line, word)\n            current_length += length(word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Don't forget to add the last line\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_lines, join(current_line, \" \"))\n    end\n\n    # Return the wrapped text as a single string separated by newline characters\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ninput_text = \"This is an example text that should be wrapped to fit within a maximum text width of ten characters.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(input_text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `wrap_string` takes an input string and an optional text width (default=10).\n- It splits the input into words and iterates over each word.\n- It maintains a `current_line` to build each line and a `current_length` to track the length of that line.\n- If adding a new word would exceed the `text_width`, it appends the current line to `wrapped_lines` and starts a new line.\n- Finally, it returns the wrapped lines joined with newline characters.\n\n### Example Output:\nWhen given the input string and `text_width` of 10, the function might output:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample\ntext that\nshould be\nwrapped to\nfit within a\nmaximum\ntext width\nof ten\ncharacters.\n``` \n\nThis neatly wraps the input text, ensuring that no line exceeds the specified width (except for words that are longer than the width, which this implementation assumes doesn't happen or is acceptable if it does).","status":200,"tokens":[58,540],"elapsed":6.36191775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-255813079,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
