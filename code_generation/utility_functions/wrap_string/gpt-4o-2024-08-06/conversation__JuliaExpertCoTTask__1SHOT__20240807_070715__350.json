It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle the task, we'll create a function `wrap_string` that takes a sentence (string) and a `text_width` (integer). It will iterate through the words of the input string, adding words to a line until adding another word would exceed `text_width`. When this limit is exceeded, it starts a new line.\n\n## Steps:\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty list to hold the lines and a string to build the current line.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n   - If the current line can accommodate the word without exceeding `text_width`, add the word to the line.\n   - Otherwise, add the current line to the list of lines, and start a new line with the current word.\n4. Add the last line to the list of lines if it's not empty.\n5. Join the lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\nNow, let's implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the current word exceeds the text_width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If the current line is not empty, add it to lines\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                push!(lines, current_line)\n            end\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Add the word to the current line\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line to lines\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    # Join the lines with a newline character\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis function `wrap_string` will process the provided sentence with a `text_width` of 10 and output the result with each line wrapped accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[162,455],"elapsed":6.297104833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1470443781,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
