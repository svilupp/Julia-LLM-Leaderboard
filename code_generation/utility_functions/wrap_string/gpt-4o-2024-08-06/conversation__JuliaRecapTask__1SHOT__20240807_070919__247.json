[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task, we'll create a `wrap_string` function that takes a string and a `text_width` argument with a default value of 10. The function will iterate over the words in the input string and construct lines such that each line doesn't exceed the specified width. If adding a word would exceed the limit, it will start a new line.\n\nHereâ€™s how we can implement the function:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Split the Input String:** We'll break the input string into individual words using spaces as delimiters.\n2. **Iterate Over Words:** We'll accumulate words into a line until adding another word would exceed `text_width`.\n3. **Check Width:** Whenever the width limit would be exceeded, append the current line to the result, then start a new line with the current word.\n4. **Handle Remaining Words:** Ensure any remaining words are added as a line if not empty.\n\nHere's the Julia implementation of this logic:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::AbstractString, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(input)\n    if isempty(words)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    current_line = words[1]\n    wrapped_lines = String[]\n    \n    for word in words[2:end]\n        # Calculate if adding the next word will exceed the width\n        if length(current_line) + 1 + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word  # Append word to current line\n        else\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word  # Start new line with the word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last collected line\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nsample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(sample_text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`split(input)`:** This splits the input string into words using space as the delimiter.\n- **`for word in words[2:end]`:** We iterate starting from the second word because we initialize `current_line` with the first word.\n- **`length(current_line) + 1 + length(word)`:** This checks the total length if we were to add another word including a space.\n- **`push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)`:** Appends the current line to the array of wrapped lines when the width limit is reached.\n- **`join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")`:** Joins all wrapped lines with a newline character to produce the final output.\n\nThis function handles basic word wrapping and should satisfy the requirements specified for the task.","status":200,"tokens":[315,558],"elapsed":6.441136834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1674225136,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
