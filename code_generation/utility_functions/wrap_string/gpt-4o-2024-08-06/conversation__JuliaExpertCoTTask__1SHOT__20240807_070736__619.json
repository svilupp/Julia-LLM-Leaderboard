Here are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words and keep adding them to the current line until the addition of a word would cause the line to exceed `text_width`.\n3. If adding a word would exceed the `text_width`, the current line should be added to the result, a new line begins, and the word starts the new line.\n4. Continue this until all words are processed.\n5. Return the wrapped text as a single string with newline characters where appropriate.\n\nLet's write the function and an example.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # If adding the word exceeds the text width, start a new line\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # If not the first word in the line, add a space\n            current_line *== (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if there's any content\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        wrapped_text *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis implementation should handle the task as described, splitting the text into lines where no line exceeds the specified width unless a single word exceeds it.","status":200,"tokens":[162,375],"elapsed":5.594134458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-617260347,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
