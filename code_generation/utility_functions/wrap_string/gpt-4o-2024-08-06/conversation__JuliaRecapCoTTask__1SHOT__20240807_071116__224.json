[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n### Plan\n1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty result string and a line length counter.\n2. **Iterate Over Words**: Split the input string into words.\n3. **Check Line Length**: For each word, check if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n   - If it would exceed, append a newline character to the result string, and reset the line length counter.\n   - Add the word to the current line and update the line length counter.\n4. **Return the Result**: Ensure the result string properly reflects the formatted text.\n\n### Step-by-step Implementation\n- Use Julia's `split` function to split the input text by spaces.\n- Accumulate words and spaces until the `text_width` is reached.\n- Insert a newline when necessary, and track the length of the current line.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    result = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    current_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if the current line + this word exceeds the text_width\n        if current_length + word_length + (current_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # Add the current line to result and reset the current line\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n            current_length = 0\n        end\n        # If the current line is not empty, add a space before adding the word\n        if current_length > 0\n            current_line *= \" \"\n            current_length += 1\n        end\n        # Add the word to the current line\n        current_line *= word\n        current_length += word_length\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line if it has content\n    if current_length > 0\n        push!(result, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is an example text that should be wrapped appropriately.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation with Example\n- For the `example_text` provided, the function will break the string into lines, each fitting within `text_width = 10`.\n- It will handle spaces and word lengths accurately to ensure the wrapping is precise.\n\nBy stepping through each word and carefully managing line lengths, this function will efficiently wrap any input string to fit within the specified text width.","status":200,"tokens":[316,574],"elapsed":9.28525375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":359843844,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
