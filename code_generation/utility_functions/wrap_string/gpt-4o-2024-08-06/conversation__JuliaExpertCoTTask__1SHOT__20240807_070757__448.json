Parse the input string into individual words.\n2. Initialize an empty string (or list) to construct the output and a counter to keep track of the current line length.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n   - Check if adding the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n   - If yes, append a new line character to start a new line.\n   - Add the word to the current line.\n4. Return the constructed string with line breaks at appropriate positions.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_text)\n    output = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            output *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        elseif current_line_length > 0\n            output *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        output *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis code will produce the output with the given example, wrapping the text such that no line exceeds the specified `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[162,290],"elapsed":3.714708959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1452618375,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
