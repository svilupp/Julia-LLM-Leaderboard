You can write a function `wrap_string` in Julia that takes a string and a maximum text width, and wraps the text such that no line exceeds the specified width. Here's one way to implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    lines = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if !isempty(current_line)\n            if length(current_line) + 1 + length(word) > text_width\n                # If adding the next word exceeds the width, push the current line and start a new line\n                push!(lines, current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                # Otherwise, add the word to the current line\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        else\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Push the last line if it has content\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")  # Join all lines with newline characters\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"This is a simple example demonstrating how text can be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `wrap_string` splits the input text into words using `split(text)`.\n- It iterates over each word and decides whether to add it to the current line or start a new line.\n- `current_line` accumulates words until adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n- If adding the next word would exceed `text_width`, the current line is pushed into `lines`, and a new line is started with the current word.\n- After the loop, if there is any content left in `current_line`, it's added to `lines`.\n- Finally, the lines are joined with newline characters and returned as a single wrapped string.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nGiven the `example_text`, the output will be:\n\n```\nThis is a\nsimple\nexample\ndemonstrating\nhow text\ncan be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nAdjust the `text_width` parameter to change the maximum width of each line.","status":200,"tokens":[58,481],"elapsed":6.26760575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1977054691,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
