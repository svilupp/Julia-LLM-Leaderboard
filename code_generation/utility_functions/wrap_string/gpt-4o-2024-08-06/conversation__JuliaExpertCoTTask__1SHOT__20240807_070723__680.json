Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words, keeping track of the current line length.\n3. Add a word to the current line if its addition does not exceed the text width. If it does, start a new line.\n4. Return the wrapped string with inserted new lines.\n\nNow, let's implement the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result_lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        if current_line_length + word_length + 1 > text_width && current_line != \"\"\n            # Append current line to result and start a new line\n            push!(result_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n            current_line_length = word_length\n        else\n            # If it's not the first word on line, add space\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n            current_line_length += word_length\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(result_lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(result_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\n\nWith the example provided, the output will be:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis solution takes the input string and wraps it into lines ensuring that no line exceeds the specified text width.","status":200,"tokens":[162,380],"elapsed":4.029973291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":794953348,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
