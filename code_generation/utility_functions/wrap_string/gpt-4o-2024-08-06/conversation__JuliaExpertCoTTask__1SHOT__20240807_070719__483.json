This involves iterating over the words in the input string and accumulating them into a line until adding another word would exceed the specified `text_width`. \n\nLet's implement this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Split the Input**: Split the input string into words.\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Maintain a list to keep track of the current line and its length.\n3. **Iterate and Wrap**: Iterate through each word, adding it to the current line if it doesn't exceed the maximum width, otherwise start a new line.\n4. **Join and Combine**: Once done, join the accumulated lines with newline characters.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the word would exceed the width\n        if isempty(current_line)\n            proposed_line = word\n        else\n            proposed_line = current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n        \n        # If the proposed line is within the limit, update the current line\n        if length(proposed_line) <= text_width\n            current_line = proposed_line\n        else\n            # Otherwise, save the current line and start a new one\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Push the last line if any\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\n\nNow, checking the solution with the example provided:\n\n```julia\noutput = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nThis will produce the wrapped lines based on the specified text width, demonstrating the function's capability.","status":200,"tokens":[162,416],"elapsed":3.903976625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1199022741,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
