We'll iterate over the words of the input string and build lines of text such that each line's length does not exceed a specified `text_width`. Here's how we'll implement it:\n\n1. Split the given string into words.\n2. Initialize a variable to hold the current line and a list to store wrapped lines.\n3. Iterate over the words, adding them to the current line until adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n4. If adding a word exceeds the `text_width`, store the current line in the list and start a new line with the current word.\n5. Return the wrapped lines joined by newline characters.\n\nNow, let's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split text into words\n    lines = []           # List to store lines\n    current_line = \"\"    # String to accumulate words in the current line\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the current word exceeds the text width\n        if !isempty(current_line) && length(current_line) + 1 + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)  # Save the current line\n            current_line = \"\"           # Reset current line\n        end\n        \n        # Add the word to the current line\n        if !isempty(current_line)\n            current_line *= \" \"  # Add a space before appending a new word\n        end\n        current_line *= word\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last accumulated line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    # Join the lines with newline characters and return\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input string into words, then iteratively builds lines under the specified width, and finally, it returns the formatted text with appropriate line breaks.","status":200,"tokens":[162,434],"elapsed":4.642732833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":328719901,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
