In Julia, you can create a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum text width and wraps the text such that no line exceeds the specified width. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_lines = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        else\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped correctly.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `wrap_string` takes a string `s` and an integer `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n- It splits the input string into words and iterates over each word.\n- For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n  - If not, it appends the word to the current line.\n  - If it does exceed the width, the current line is added to the list of wrapped lines, and the word starts a new current line.\n- At the end of the iteration, if there's any unfinished line, it's added to the wrapped lines.\n- Finally, the lines are joined with newline characters, resulting in wrapped text.\n\nThis function should wrap the input string according to the specified width, ensuring words are not split, and returns the wrapped text as output.","status":200,"tokens":[58,400],"elapsed":4.285722167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1585275380,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
