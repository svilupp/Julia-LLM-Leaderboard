[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll write a function named `wrap_string` in Julia. The function will take two input arguments: `text::AbstractString`, which is the string we want to wrap, and `text_width::Int=10`, which is the maximum width of text allowed per line. The function will iterate over the words in the input string and concatenate them, adding new lines whenever adding another word would exceed the given `text_width`.\n\nHere is how we can structure this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line = String[]  # Array to hold words of the current line\n    result = String[]  # Array to accumulate all the wrapped lines\n\n    for word in words\n        if sum(length, current_line) + length(current_line) - 1 + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            push!(current_line, word)\n        else\n            push!(result, join(current_line, \" \"))\n            current_line = [word]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(result, join(current_line, \" \"))\n    end\n    \n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a test of the wrapping function. It should handle the text correctly.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `split` function divides the input string into words based on spaces.\n- `current_line` is a temporary list to construct each line of wrapped text.\n- We check if adding another word to `current_line` will exceed `text_width`. If not, we add the word to `current_line`.\n- If the line would be too long, we append `current_line` as a complete line to `result` and start a new line with the current word.\n- Finally, wrap any remaining words in `current_line` into the `result`.\n- The entire result is joined with newline characters, returning the wrapped string.\n\nThis implementation should cover typical scenarios where text wrapping is needed.","status":200,"tokens":[316,457],"elapsed":4.455957333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2050009978,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
