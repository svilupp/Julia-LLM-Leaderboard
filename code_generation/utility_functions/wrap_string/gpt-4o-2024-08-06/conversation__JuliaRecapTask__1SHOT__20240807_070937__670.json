X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

As soon as appending another word would exceed `text_width` (considering spaces), we finalize the current line and start a new one.\n\n4. **Join Lines with Newlines**: Once all words are processed, the lines are joined using newline characters to format the final result.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider cases like empty strings or very long individual words.\n\n6. **Example Demonstration**: Illustrate the function with an example.\n\nHere's how this is implemented in a Julia function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(input_str)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (isempty(current_line) ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= isempty(current_line) ? word : \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Join the lines with newline characters\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is an example to demonstrate how the wrap_string function works.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Splitting**: Uses `split(input_str)` to break the input into words.\n- **Accumulating**: As the loop processes each word, it checks if adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n  - **If it exceeds**: The current line is saved, and a new line starts with the current word.\n  - **If not**: The word is added to the current line with a space if needed.\n- **Finalizing**: Ensures any remaining text is added as a line.\n- **Output**: Combines everything with the `join` function using `\"\\n\"`.\n\n### Example:\n\nGiven `example_text` with a `text_width` of `10`, the function will format the text to ensure no line exceeds 10 characters. This clearly demonstrates the word wrapping functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[315,600],"elapsed":6.196868583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":290822400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
