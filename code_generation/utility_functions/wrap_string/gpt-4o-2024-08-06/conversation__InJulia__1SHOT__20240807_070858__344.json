To implement the `wrap_string` function in Julia, you'll want to iterate over the words in the input string and construct lines such that each line does not exceed a given `text_width`. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line = \"\"    # Initialize the current line as an empty string\n    wrapped_lines = []   # Initialize an array to hold the wrapped lines\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the current word would exceed the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If the current line is not empty, push it to wrapped lines\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            end\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # If the current line is not empty, add a space before adding the word\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Push the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Join the wrapped lines with newlines\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is an example of wrapping text into lines of limited width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`split(text)`**: This function splits the text into an array of words based on spaces.\n- **Logical Check**: In the loop, if adding the next word (with a space) exceeds the `text_width`, the current line is saved, and the word is placed on the new line.\n- **`push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)`**: Adds the current line to the list of wrapped lines and clears `current_line` for new words.\n- **Final join**: Combines all wrapped lines into a single string, using `\\n` as the delimiter to add newlines.\n\nThis function will ensure that each line does not exceed the `text_width` limit and words that don't fit on the current line are moved to the start of the next line.","status":200,"tokens":[58,504],"elapsed":4.584690417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":442420592,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
