[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

This function should insert new line characters at the appropriate places to ensure that no line exceeds the given width, while preserving whole words.\n\n## Steps to Solve the Task:\n1. **Input Parsing:** The function should accept a string and an integer for the maximum line width.\n2. **Word Splitting:** Break the input string into words.\n3. **Concatenation and Line Breaking:** Iterate over the list of words and build each line while checking the total character length. If adding the next word exceeds `text_width`, start a new line.\n4. **Result Formation:** Combine the lines into a single string with newline characters.\n5. **Output:** Return the wrapped string.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the text width\n        if length(current_line) + 1 + length(word) > text_width\n            # Append the current line to the lines list\n            push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # If the current line is not empty, add a space\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            # Append the word to the current line\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Don't forget to add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n    end\n    \n    # Join all lines with \\n to get the wrapped text\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example Usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 20)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Example Explanation:\nFor an example input sentence as given in the function, the words will be wrapped in such a way that no line will exceed a width of 20 characters. The `wrap_string` function will provide clarity and easy readability by inserting new lines at appropriate points, maintaining the coherence of words without breaking them mid-word.\n\nBy using the code and the example provided above, you should get a well formatted string output with line breaks where necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[315,541],"elapsed":6.710852625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-265448195,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
