[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

When adding a word to a line would exceed the `text_width`, the word should start a new line.\n\nHere is how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n### Useful Snippets\n\n1. **Splitting Strings into Words**: Use `split(text)` to split a string into words.\n2. **Concatenating Strings**: Use `*` or `string()` to concatenate strings.\n3. **String Length**: Use `length(s)` to determine the lengths of strings.\n4. **Iterate Over Words**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through words.\n\n### Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    lines = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_line == \"\"\n            # Start a new line\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Check if adding the next word would exceed the allowed length\n            if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n                # +1 is for the space character\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            else\n                # Add the current line to the list of lines and start a new line\n                push!(lines, current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it exists\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Return the concatenated lines separated by newline characters\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, text_width=10))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Splitting**: We start by splitting the input `text` into `words` using the `split()` function.\n- **Line Building**: Using a loop, we iterate over each word to build `current_line`. If appending a word would exceed `text_width`, we save the line and begin a new one.\n- **Joining**: Finally, we join all the lines into a single string with newline characters to represent line breaks.\n\nThis function respects the text width set by the `text_width` parameter and formats the text accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[316,518],"elapsed":7.476769667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-288580998,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
