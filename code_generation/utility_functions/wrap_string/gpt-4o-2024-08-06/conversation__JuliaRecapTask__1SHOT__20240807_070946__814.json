X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Let's go over the plan to implement the solution:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: \n   - The function `wrap_string` should accept a sentence (string) and a maximum line length (`text_width`).\n   - It should return a new string where words are wrapped such that no line exceeds `text_width`.\n   \n2. **Iterate Over Words**:\n   - We'll split the input string into words using Julia's `split` function.\n   \n3. **Track Line Lengths**:\n   - Initialize a new string to hold the result and a counter to track the current line length.\n   - Append words to the line until adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, then insert a newline character.\n   \n4. **Build the Result String**:\n   - Concatenate words appropriately, inserting line breaks where necessary.\n   - Make sure not to add unnecessary spaces or line breaks.\n\n5. **Return the Wrapped String**:\n   - Output the correctly wrapped text as the result.\n\nHere's how you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10) :: AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_lines = String[]  # An array to store lines of wrapped text\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding this word exceeds the line length\n        if current_line_length + word_length <= text_width\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"  # Add space before adding new word\n                current_line_length += 1\n            end\n        else\n            # Start a new line\n            if current_line_length > 0  # Avoid adding empty line on start\n                push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            end\n            current_line = \"\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        # Add the word\n        current_line *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line if it contains words\n    if current_line_length > 0\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Join the lines with new lines\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-performance, high-level programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- We split the input string into individual words using `split(text)`.\n- A loop iterates over each word, calculating if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n- If adding the word exceeds the limit, the current line is added to `wrapped_lines`, and a new line is started.\n- Words are concatenated with spaces and stored in `wrapped_lines`.\n- Finally, the lines are joined with newline characters and returned as a single string.\n\nThis code correctly handles the wrapping of text based on the specified line width. You can test it with different strings and `text_width` values to see it in action.","status":200,"tokens":[315,678],"elapsed":8.658744416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1195535633,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
