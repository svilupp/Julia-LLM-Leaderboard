[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll create a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum text width. The function will iterate over the words in the string, appending them to a line until adding another word would exceed the specified `text_width`. In such cases, the function will insert a newline to begin a new line with that word.\n\nLet's complete the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Split the input text into words.\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width  # +1 accounts for the space between words.\n            # Add the current line to wrapped_text and reset current_line to begin a new line.\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Add word to current_line; if current_line is empty, skip the space.\n            current_line *= isempty(current_line) ? word : \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Append the last line if it exists.\n    wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n    \n    return rstrip(wrapped_text)  # Remove the last newline character\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"This is an example of a string that needs to be wrapped according to the text width.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Splitting**: We use `split` to break the input string into words.\n- **Tracking lines**: `current_line` accumulates words until the length would exceed `text_width`. \n- **Handling overflow**: If adding another word would exceed the limit, concatenate `current_line` into `wrapped_text` with a newline and start a new `current_line`.\n- **Final output**: At the end, the final `current_line` is added to the output. We use `rstrip` to remove any trailing newline.\n\nThis code should meet your requirements and produce the wrapped text example correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[315,441],"elapsed":5.5447415,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":204845194,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
