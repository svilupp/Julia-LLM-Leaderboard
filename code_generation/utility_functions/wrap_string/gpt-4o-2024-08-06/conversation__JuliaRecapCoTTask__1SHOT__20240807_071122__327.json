[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the given task, we'll write a function called `wrap_string`. The function will iterate through words in a string and add a new line whenever the cumulative length of words (plus spaces) exceeds a specified text width (`text_width`). By default, the text width will be set to 10 characters. \n\nLet's start with a plan:\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Maintain a current line buffer and accumulate words into this buffer until adding another word would make its length exceed the `text_width`.\n3. When the buffer can't accommodate further words, append it to the result and reset it for new accumulation.\n4. Return the concatenated result with new lines.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10) :: AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # If adding the next word would exceed the text_width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # Add the current line to the result and append a newline\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            # Start a new line with the current word\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Add a space if the current line is not empty\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            # Append the word to the current line\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last accumulated line to the result\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Arguments**: \n  - `text`: A string that needs to be wrapped.\n  - `text_width`: An optional integer specifying the width of each line (default is 10).\n  \n- **Process**:\n  - Splits the text into individual words.\n  - Builds lines by concatenating words until adding another would exceed the `text_width`.\n  - Once the width is exceeded, initiates a new line.\n  \n- **Example**:\n  - Given the text \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" and a width of 10, the output is:\n    ```\n    The quick\n    brown fox\n    jumps over\n    the lazy\n    dog\n    ```\n\nThis solution ensures that words are not split across lines, making it simple and effective for word-wrapping requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[316,556],"elapsed":6.180695583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1736301688,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
