I then initialize variables for `lines` and `current_line` to store the wrapped lines and the current line, respectively.\n\n2. **Write functions and other code:** I define a function called `wrap_string` that takes a text as input.\n\n3. **Solve the task:** I iteratively over the words in the text, adding each word to the current line. If the current line exceeds the text width, I add a new line to the `lines` and start a new current line with the first word of the next line. I continue this process until all words in the text have been processed.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:** I call the `wrap_string` function with the example text and inspect the output to ensure that the words are wrapped correctly into lines of the specified width.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n\nOutput:\nThis function will\nwrap words into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":34.510715958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":6958,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
