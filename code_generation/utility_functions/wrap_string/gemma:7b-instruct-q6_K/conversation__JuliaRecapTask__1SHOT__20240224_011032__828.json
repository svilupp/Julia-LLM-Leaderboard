[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has many words and it will be split into lines of at most 10 characters.\n\nThe text is wrapped into multiple lines, with a maximum of 10 characters per line.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `wrap_string` iterates over the words in the input string `str`.\n* It maintains a current line and adds a new line when the maximum text width is exceeded.\n* The function splits the string into words and joins them with spaces.\n* The function adds a new line after each word that exceeds the text width.\n* The function joins the lines into a single string with newlines.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The text width is a parameter to the function and can be adjusted as needed.\n* The function does not handle punctuation or special characters.\n* The function assumes that the input string is a single paragraph.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":34.59592875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":17326,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
