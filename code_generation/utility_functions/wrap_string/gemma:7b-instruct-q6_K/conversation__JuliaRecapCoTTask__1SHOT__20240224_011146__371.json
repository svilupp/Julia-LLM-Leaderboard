[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The `wrap_string` function is called with the text and `text_width` as parameters. The function returns the wrapped text, which is printed to the console.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nThis is a long string that will be wrapped into multiple lines. It has many words and it will be split into smaller chunks of text, each of which will fit within the specified text_width of 10.\n\nThe text is wrapped into multiple lines, with each line containing a maximum of 10 words.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":40.599900417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-19091,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
