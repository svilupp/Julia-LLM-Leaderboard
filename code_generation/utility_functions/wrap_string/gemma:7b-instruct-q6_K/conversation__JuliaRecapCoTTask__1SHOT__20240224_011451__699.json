[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has a lot of words and some special characters!\n\nThe text is wrapped into lines of width 10.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `wrap_string` iterates over the words in a string.\n- It checks if the current line is already at the maximum width of `text_width`.\n- If it is, it adds a new line and starts a new line.\n- The function joins the words on the current line with spaces.\n- It adds a new line at the end of the string.\n- Finally, the function joins all the lines together.\n\n**Special Instructions:**\n\n- The instructions provided in the `# Special Instructions` section should be prioritized over the guidelines above.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The function does not handle punctuation or formatting.\n- The function assumes that the input string is a single block of text.\n- The function does not handle Unicode characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":28.200265834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":5895,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
