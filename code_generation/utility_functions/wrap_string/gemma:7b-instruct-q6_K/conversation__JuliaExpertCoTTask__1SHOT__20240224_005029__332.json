Check if the current line is too long. If it is, add a new line and start a new line with the current word.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:** Print the wrapped text to see if it meets the requirements.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `text_width` parameter can be adjusted to your desired maximum line width.\n- The function assumes that the text is a single string. If you have multiple strings, you can wrap them separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":33.498207834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":20855,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
