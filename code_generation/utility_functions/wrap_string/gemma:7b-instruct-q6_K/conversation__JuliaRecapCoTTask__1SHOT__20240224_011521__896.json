[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has a lot of words and it will be split into lines of a maximum width of 10.\n\nThe text is wrapped into multiple lines, with each line having a maximum of 10 characters.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `wrap_string` iterates over the words in the text.\n* It maintains a current line and adds a new line when the maximum text width is exceeded.\n* The function splits the text into words and uses the `length` function to determine the length of the current line and the maximum text width.\n* If the length of the current line plus the length of the word plus one character for spacing exceeds the maximum text width, a new line is added.\n* The function then adds the word to the current line and continues to the next word.\n* Finally, the function adds a new line at the end of the text and returns the wrapped text.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The text width can be adjusted to your preference.\n* The function does not handle punctuation or special characters.\n* The function does not preserve the original line structure of the text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,435],"elapsed":30.132355125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":13712,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
