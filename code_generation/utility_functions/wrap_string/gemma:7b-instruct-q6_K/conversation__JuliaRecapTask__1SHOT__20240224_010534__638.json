[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has many words and it is quite long.\n\nThe text will be wrapped into a maximum of 10 characters per line.\n\nThe resulting string will have a new line inserted after each line that exceeds the text width.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `wrap_string` takes a string `str` and an integer `text_width` as input.\n* It splits the string into words and iterates over them.\n* It maintains a current line and adds a new line when the maximum text width is exceeded.\n* The function joins the lines into a single string with new lines inserted as needed.\n* The final string is returned.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `text_width` parameter is optional. If not specified, the default value of 10 will be used.\n* The function does not handle any special characters or formatting.\n* It assumes that the input string is a valid Julia string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":34.421797083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":23334,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
