It has many words and will exceed the text width of 10 words per line.\"\n\nwrap_string(text)\n\n# Output:\n\"\"\"\nThis is a long string that needs to be wrapped. It has many words and will exceed the\ntext width of 10 words per line.\n\nThe text will be wrapped as follows:\n\nThis is a long string that needs to be wrapped. It has many words and will excee\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function splits the text into words and iterates over them.\n* It keeps track of the number of words that have already been added to the line.\n* If the number of words in the line exceeds `text_width`, a new line is added.\n* The function rejoins the wrapped words with spaces and new line characters.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The function does not handle punctuation or formatting.\n* It assumes that the text is a string.\n* The `text_width` parameter is optional, and the default value is 10.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":32.611272583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-26640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
