[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has a lot of words and it will be split into lines of a maximum width of 10.\n\nThe text is divided into multiple lines, each of which has a maximum width of 10.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `wrap_string` iterates over the words in the text and adds a new line each time the maximum text width is exceeded.\n- The text is split into words and the current line is kept in a variable `current_line`.\n- If the length of the current line exceeds the text width, a new line is added to the `lines` list and the current line is reset.\n- The function joins the lines list with newlines and returns the wrapped text.\n\n**Special Instructions:**\n\nNone\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The text width is a parameter to the function and can be customized.\n- The function preserves the original text formatting, including whitespace and punctuation.\n- The function does not handle nested quotes or other special formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":28.19618625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-29703,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
