[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It has a lot of words and it will be split into lines of at most 10 characters.\n\nThe text is split into multiple lines, each line having a maximum of 10 characters.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `wrap_string` iterates over the words in the text.\n* It maintains a current line and adds a new line when the maximum text width is exceeded.\n* The function splits the text into words and uses the `length` of the current line and the word to determine whether a new line is needed.\n* The function joins the lines together with new lines in between.\n\n**Special Instructions:**\n\nThe text width is set to `10` in the example usage. This can be changed to any other value.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The function does not handle punctuation or formatting.\n* The function does not preserve the original line structure of the text.\n* The function does not handle embedded quotes or code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":25.910065666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":8796,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
