Define the function `wrap_string` that takes a string input and a maximum width.\n2. Split the string into words.\n3. Iterate over the words, appending them to a current line until adding another word would exceed the maximum width.\n4. If it exceeds, start a new line.\n5. Join the resulting list of lines into a single string separated by newline characters.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) <= text_width\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nI will now run the example to check if the function works correctly. \n\nThe expected output should have words wrapped, e.g., something like this:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nNow, letâ€™s execute the function and observe the output.","status":200,"tokens":[162,317],"elapsed":4.300314833,"cost":0.00021449999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-811693699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
