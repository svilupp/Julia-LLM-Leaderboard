X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Key functions like `split()`, and a loop structure will help us iterate through each word.\n   - We can use `join()` to concatenate the words back together with new lines as needed.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: \n   - The function will take a string and a maximum width limit and will iterate over each word to build a new string with line breaks where the width exceeds the limit.\n\n3. **Double-check the Solution**: \n   - We will ensure that we're handling edge cases, such as long words that exceed the width, and check the final output for correctness.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check the length with the space\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If adding the new word exceeds the width, push current line and reset\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # If current line is not empty, add a space\n            current_line *= current_line == \"\" ? word : \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Push any remaining text in current_line to wrapped_lines\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is an example of the wrap string function in Julia\"\nresult = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Example Explanation:\n- In the example provided, the text \"This is an example of the wrap string function in Julia\" will be processed, and lines will be wrapped according to the maximum width of 10 characters.\n  \n### Output:\nWhen the example is executed, the output will look something like this:\n```\nThis is an\nexample of\nthe wrap\nstring\nfunction\nin Julia\n```\n\n### Double-check:\n- Ensure it handles both short and long words appropriately.\n- Adequate space management when adding words to a line.\n- Test cases with varying input strings and widths can be useful for validation, but the core functionality appears to be working as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[316,526],"elapsed":6.354766583,"cost":0.000363,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":670269617,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
