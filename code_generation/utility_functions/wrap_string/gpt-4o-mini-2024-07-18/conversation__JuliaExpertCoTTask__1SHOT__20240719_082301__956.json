Define the function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional maximum width argument (defaulting to 10).\n2. Initialize an empty string to store the result and a variable to track the current line length.\n3. Split the input string into words.\n4. Iterate through each word:\n   - If adding the word exceeds the maximum width, append a new line before adding the word.\n   - If not, just add the word to the current line.\n5. Return the wrapped string.\n\nLet's implement this step by step.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input)  # Split the input string into words\n    result = \"\"           # Initialize the result string\n    current_line_length = 0  # Initialize the current line length\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # If adding the word exceeds the text width, insert a new line\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0  # Reset the current line length\n        else\n            # If it's not the first word in the line, add a space\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                result *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n        end\n\n        # Add the word to the result and update the current line length\n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\noutput = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Implementation\n- The function `wrap_string` processes the input string.\n- It checks the length of each word and decides whether to create a new line or continue on the current line based on `text_width`.\n- The result is constructed as a new string with appropriately placed newline characters.\n\n### Testing the Function\nNow let's see a sample output for the provided input:\n\n```julia\noutput = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nThe expected output would be:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis confirms the correctness of the method applied for word wrapping based on the defined width.","status":200,"tokens":[162,521],"elapsed":7.139175084,"cost":0.0003369,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1709565307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
