[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, we will create the function `wrap_string` that will take a string as input, split it into words, and then construct a new string by adding a newline character whenever the current line exceeds a specified width (in this case, `text_width` should default to 10).\n\nLet's outline the approach:\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty string for the result and a string to keep track of the current line.\n3. Iterate over the words, appending each to the current line.\n4. If adding a word exceeds `text_width`, add the current line to the result and start a new line with the current word.\n5. Finally, add any remaining text in the current line to the result.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    result = String[]  # Create an array to store the lines\n    current_line = \"\"   # Initialize the current line\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if the current line can accommodate the new word\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)  # Add the current line to the result\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            current_line *= current_line == \"\" ? word : \" $word\"  # Append the word to the current line\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line to the result if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(result, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")  # Join all lines with newline characters\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a simple example of text wrapping.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the code:\n- The function `wrap_string` accepts a string `text` and an optional integer `text_width` (defaulting to 10).\n- The `split` function divides the string into individual words.\n- We maintain an array `result` to accumulate each line and a string `current_line` to build the current line dynamically.\n- As we iterate over each `word`, we check whether adding it to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, we push the current line to `result` and reset `current_line` to the current `word`.\n- After the loop, we add any remaining text in `current_line` to `result`.\n- Finally, we join the lines with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and return the complete wrapped string.\n\n### Double-checking the solution:\n- Make sure that words are not split in the middle and that the maximum width does not get exceeded.\n- Verify that edge cases (e.g., empty strings or very short words) are handled properly.\n\nThe implementation should work correctly, and running the example will display the wrapped string as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[315,652],"elapsed":8.669005083,"cost":0.00043844999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1245923448,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
