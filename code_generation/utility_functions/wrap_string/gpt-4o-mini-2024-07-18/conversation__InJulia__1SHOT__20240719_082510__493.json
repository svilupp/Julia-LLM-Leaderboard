You can create a function `wrap_string` in Julia that takes a string and a maximum width for each line of text. The function will then split the string into words and construct a new string with new lines added whenever the maximum width is exceeded.\n\nHere’s a sample implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    wrapped_text = String[]  # Initialize an array to hold wrapped lines\n    current_line = \"\"  # Variable to build the current line\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the maximum width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_text, current_line)  # Add the current line to the wrapped_text\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Add the word to the current line\n            current_line = current_line == \"\" ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add any remaining text in current_line to wrapped_text\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(wrapped_text, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_text, \"\\n\")  # Join the lines with new line characters\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is an example of a text that needs to be wrapped according to a specified width.\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `wrap_string` splits the input `text` into words using `split()`.\n- It then initializes an empty array `wrapped_text` to store the lines of wrapped text and a string `current_line` to build the current line.\n- As it iterates through each word, it checks if adding that word to `current_line` would exceed the specified `text_width`.\n- If it does exceed the width, the current line is pushed to `wrapped_text`, and a new line begins with the current word.\n- If it doesn’t exceed the width, the word is added to the current line.\n- Finally, any remaining text in `current_line` is added to `wrapped_text`, and all lines are joined together with newline characters for the final output.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the provided text and a text width of 10, the output will be:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample of a\ntext that\nneeds to be\nwrapped\naccording to\na specified\nwidth.\n``` \n\nYou can adjust the `text_width` parameter to see how the wrapping changes based on different widths.","status":200,"tokens":[58,571],"elapsed":7.5061845,"cost":0.0003513,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1192568383,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
