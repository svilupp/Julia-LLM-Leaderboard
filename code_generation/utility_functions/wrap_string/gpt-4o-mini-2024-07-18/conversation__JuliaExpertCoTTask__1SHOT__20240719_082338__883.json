Define the function `wrap_string` which takes a single string input.\n2. Split the string into words.\n3. Iterate over the words and build lines. If adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, I will start a new line.\n4. Return the wrapped string.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    wrapped_lines = []   # Initialize an array to hold the wrapped lines\n    current_line = \"\"    # Initialize the current line\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if current line can accommodate the new word\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            # If it's not empty, add a space before the new word\n            current_line *= length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" * word : word\n        else\n            # Push the current line to the lines array and reset it\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Push any remaining words on the last line\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")  # Join all lines with new line characters\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nNow let's check if the solution works correctly by running the example. \n\nWhen you run `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`, you should expect the output to properly wrap the words based on the specified width of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[162,379],"elapsed":6.978002959,"cost":0.0002517,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-844448092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
