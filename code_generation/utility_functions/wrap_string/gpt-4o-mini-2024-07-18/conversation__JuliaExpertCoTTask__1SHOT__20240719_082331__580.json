Define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum width for each line.\n2. Split the string into words.\n3. Iterate through the words, adding them to a current line until adding another word would exceed the maximum width.\n4. When this happens, append the current line to the result and start a new line.\n5. Finally, return the wrapped lines as a single string with new lines.\n\nNow, let's implement this step-by-step.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    wrapped_lines = []    # Initialize an array for wrapped lines\n    current_line = \"\"     # Current line being constructed\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the word exceeds the width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)  # Save the completed line\n            current_line = word                   # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            if current_line == \"\"\n                current_line *= word              # If current line is empty, just add the word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word        # Add the word with a space\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Append any remaining words in the current line\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")  # Join lines and return as a single string\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's check the output of this function with the given example to ensure that it works correctly. \n\nRunning the above code should yield the wrapped string based on the maximum line width of 10.","status":200,"tokens":[162,401],"elapsed":3.953786791,"cost":0.0002649,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1643347103,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
