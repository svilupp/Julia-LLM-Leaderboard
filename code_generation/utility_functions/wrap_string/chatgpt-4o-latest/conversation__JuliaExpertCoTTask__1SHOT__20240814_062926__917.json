It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. I'll iterate over words in the input string.\n2. I'll keep track of the current line length.\n3. I'll add a new line if adding a word would exceed the `text_width`.\n4. I'll join the result together to create the final wrapped string.\n\n### Function Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n\n    result *= current_line\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Example Execution\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\n### Checking Solution\n\nThe output shows that each line in the wrapped text does not exceed the specified `text_width` (10 characters).","status":200,"tokens":[162,252],"elapsed":3.607901334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-460741498,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
