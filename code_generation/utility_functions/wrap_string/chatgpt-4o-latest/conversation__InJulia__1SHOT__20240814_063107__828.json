Below is a Julia function `wrap_string` that takes a string and wraps it by adding new lines such that the length of each line does not exceed a maximum width (`text_width`), which is set to 10 by default.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = split(input_str, r\"\\s+\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty current line and a result array\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = []\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word to the current line would exceed the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width && !isempty(current_line)\n            # If it does, push the current line to the result and start a new line\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Otherwise, add the word to the current line\n            # Add a space before the word if the current line is not empty\n            current_line *= isempty(current_line) ? word : \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Push the last line to the result if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(result, current_line)\n    end\n\n    # Combine all lines with a newline character and return the wrapped string\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```julia\ninput_str = \"This is an example of a string that needs wrapping.\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(input_str, 10)\nprintln(wrapped)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample of\na string\nthat needs\nwrapping.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function splits the input by spaces and then iterates through each word.\n- It checks whether adding the word to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`.\n- If it would exceed the width, the current line is added to the result, and a new line starts with the current word.\n- Finally, it returns the string with the newlines inserted at appropriate locations.","status":200,"tokens":[58,445],"elapsed":4.884581667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1484618259,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
