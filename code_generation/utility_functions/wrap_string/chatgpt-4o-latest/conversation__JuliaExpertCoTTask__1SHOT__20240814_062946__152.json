Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step 1: Problem Understanding and Approach\n- **Objective**: Write a function `wrap_string` that splits a string into lines such that each line's length does not exceed `text_width`.\n- **Approach**:\n  1. Split the input string into words.\n  2. Iterate through the words and keep adding them to the current line until adding the next word exceeds `text_width`.\n  3. Start a new line when adding another word would exceed the limit.\n  4. Join the lines with newline characters (`'\\n'`).\n\n### Step 2: Function Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            # If adding the word doesn't exceed text_width\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        else\n            # If it exceeds, push the current line to lines and start a new line\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line after the loop\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Example and Testing\nLet's test the function using the provided example:\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\n### Step 4: Validation\nThe function splits the text into lines while ensuring that each line has a length that does not exceed `text_width`. The output matches the expected format.","status":200,"tokens":[162,394],"elapsed":4.465346958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1963258432,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
