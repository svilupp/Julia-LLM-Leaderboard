Below is a simple implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that iterates over the words of a string and wraps them to a new line whenever the specified `text_width` would be exceeded.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)  # Split the string by spaces into individual words\n    result = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the current line plus the next word exceeds the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word  # Append the word to the current line\n        elseif isempty(current_line)\n            # Case where a single word is longer than text_width\n            push!(result, word)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        else\n            push!(result, strip(current_line))  # Push the current line to the result\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the next word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Don't forget to add any remaining text in current_line\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(result, strip(current_line))\n    end\n\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")  # Join the lines with newline\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped to a new line at every 10 characters.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```plaintext\nThis is a\nsample\ntext that\nneeds to\nbe wrapped\nto a new\nline at\nevery 10\ncharacters.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The input string `s` is split into words.\n2. Each word is checked to see if the current line, when the word is added, would exceed the specified `text_width`.\n3. If adding the word would exceed the text width, the current line is added to the result, and a new line is started with the current word.\n4. At the end, any remaining text in `current_line` is added to the result.\n\nThis function should work for simple cases where words need to be wrapped based on a specific text width.","status":200,"tokens":[58,473],"elapsed":5.127013292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-38997987,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
