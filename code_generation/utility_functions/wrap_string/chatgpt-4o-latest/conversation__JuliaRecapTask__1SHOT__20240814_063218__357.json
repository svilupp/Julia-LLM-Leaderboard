[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we need to implement a function called `wrap_string` in Julia. This function will take a string and an optional integer parameter `text_width` (defaulting to 10), and it will return a new string where words are wrapped to new lines whenever the accumulated line length exceeds the specified `text_width`.\n\n### Steps for the Solution:\n1. **Splitting the input string:** We'll start by splitting the input string into words.\n2. **Building lines with proper wrapping:** We'll iterate over these words, building lines by adding words until the line would exceed `text_width`. When it would exceed, we start a new line.\n3. **Edge Cases:** Take care of edge cases, such as when words themselves are longer than the `text_width` or when the input string is empty.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets:\n- Splitting a string by spaces: `split(\"some string\")`\n- String concatenation in loops: Use `*` or interpolation `\"$a$b\"`\n- Handling maximum width: `length(line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width`\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)  # Split the input text into words\n    if isempty(words)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_lines = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # if adding this word would exceed the text_width, push current line to results\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word  # start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word  # if nothing in current line, add the word directly\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word  # otherwise, add with a space\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Append the last line\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    \n    # Join all wrapped lines with newline character\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 12)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We first split the string into words.\n- We then iterate through each word, checking if adding the word to the current line would exceed the allowed `text_width`.\n- If it would, we move the `current_line` to a list of `wrapped_lines` and start a new line.\n- Finally, after the loop, we append any remaining line to the `wrapped_lines`.\n- The `wrapped_lines` are joined with newline characters to produce the final wrapped text output.\n\n### Output of Example:\n\n```plaintext\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet\nconsectetur\nadipisicing\nelit\n```\n\nMake sure to test this function with different `text_width` values and potential edge cases, such as very short or very long words, and an empty string. This ensures the robustness of the implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[315,655],"elapsed":7.635223167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-892120487,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
