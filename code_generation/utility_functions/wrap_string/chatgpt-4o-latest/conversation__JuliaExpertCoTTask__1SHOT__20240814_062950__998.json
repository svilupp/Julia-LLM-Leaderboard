It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nWe need to write a function `wrap_string` that takes a string, wraps the words so that each line does not exceed a given `text_width`, and returns the wrapped string.\n\n## Step 2: Plan the Approach\n\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over each word and accumulate them in a line until adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n3. When the limit is exceeded, start a new line.\n4. Combine the result into the final string with new line characters `\\n`.\n\n## Step 3: Write the Function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Push the last line\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n## Step 4: Test the Function with Example Input\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\n```\nThis\nfunction \nwill wrap\nwords\ninto lines\n```\n\nFinally, I'll execute the function to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[162,327],"elapsed":4.444118542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1774989560,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
