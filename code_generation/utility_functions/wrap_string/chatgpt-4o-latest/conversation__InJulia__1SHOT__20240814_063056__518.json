Here's how you can create the `wrap_string` function in Julia, which takes a string and a maximum `text_width` (default set to 10), and wraps the text such that it adds a new line each time the `text_width` is exceeded:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(input_str)  # Split the input string into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        line_length = length(current_line)\n\n        # Check if adding the next word will exceed the text width\n        if line_length + word_length + (line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) <= text_width\n            # If it fits, add to the current line\n            if line_length > 0\n                current_line *= \" \" * word  # Add space before word if line isn't empty\n            else\n                current_line = word\n            end\n        else\n            # If it doesn't fit, add the current line to the wrapped text and start a new line\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line to wrapped_text (if it's not empty)\n    if current_line â‰  \"\"\n        wrapped_text *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\ninput_text = \"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped according to the specified text width.\"\nwrapped_output = wrap_string(input_text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Split the String:** The `split(input_str)` function splits the input string into individual words.\n2. **Variables:**\n   - `current_line` holds the words that are currently being assembled into a line.\n   - `wrapped_text` accumulates the completed lines.\n3. **Loop Through Words:** Iterate through each word. If the current line plus the new word fits within `text_width`, add the word to the current line. Otherwise, finalize the current line and start a new one with the current word.\n4. **Final Line Check:** After the loop ends, ensure the final line is added to the wrapped text as it may not end with a newline.\n5. **Return Wrapped Text:** Return the accumulated wrapped text.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nGiven `input_text`:\n\n```julia\n\"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped according to the specified text width.\"\n```\n\nAnd setting `text_width` to 15, the function call would return:\n\n```\nThis is a\nsample text\nthat needs to\nbe wrapped\naccording to\nthe specified\ntext width.\n```\n\nEach line does not exceed 15 characters, and words are not cut off in the middle.","status":200,"tokens":[58,592],"elapsed":6.159336917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-732916069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
