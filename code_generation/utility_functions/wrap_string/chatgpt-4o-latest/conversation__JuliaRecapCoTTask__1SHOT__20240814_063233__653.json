[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the problem:\n\n### Requirements:\n1. **Function Definition**: We're asked to create a function named `wrap_string`.\n2. **Input**: The function needs to accept a string and an optional integer parameter `text_width::Int=10`.\n3. **Output**: A modified string where words are wrapped such that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`.\n4. **Processing**: Iterate over each word, add it to the current line if it doesn't exceed `text_width`. If it does, start a new line.\n\n### Steps to solve:\n1. **Split the string into words**: We can split the input string using `split(str)` function, which breaks a string into words.\n2. **Accumulate words**: Add words to the current line until adding more would exceed `text_width`.\n3. **Handling Line Breaks**: Track the current line length and insert a newline character before adding a word if it would exceed `text_width`.\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets:\n- `split(str)`: Splits a string into an array of words.\n- `length(str)`: To get the length of the string.\n- `join(arr, \"delimiter\")`: To concatenate an array of strings with a separator.\n- String interpolation `$` for including variables in strings.\n- `push!`: To append an element to an array.\n\n### Implementing the Solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : \"$current_line $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Don't forget to add the last line\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(wrapped, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Example:\n\nLet's test this function with a scenario:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nresult = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\nThe quick brown\nfox jumps over\nthe lazy dog.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The first line with words \"The quick brown\" has 14 characters, which fits under the `text_width=15`.\n- The next words \"fox jumps over\" also fit under 15 characters, so they start a new line.\n- Finally, \"the lazy dog.\" is placed on the last line.\n\n### Double-checking:\n- Handle edge cases such as empty strings and strings where each word is longer than `text_width`.\n- Ensure that spaces between words are handled correctly and only one space is maintained between words when wrapped.\n\nThis implementation should be robust and handle various edge cases efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[316,612],"elapsed":7.609254542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2024610699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
