[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

A space is only added when a word is not the first in the line.\n\n3. **Check edge cases**:\n   - Single Word Longer than `text_width`: The word will just be on its own line because it exceeds the limit.\n   - Empty Strings: Should return an empty result.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's provide an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-performance, high-level programming language for technical computing.\"\n\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\nOutput should be something like:\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-performance,\nhigh-level\nprogramming\nlanguage for\ntechnical\ncomputing.\n```\n\n### Summary:\nThe function successfully wraps text at the specified width while handling spaces correctly between words and ensuring that words that exceed the width limit are correctly managed by placing them on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[315,624],"elapsed":6.796934875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1586480729,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
