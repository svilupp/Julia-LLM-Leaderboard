It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a simple function called `wrap_string` in Julia. It takes a string and wraps it so that no line exceeds a specified width (`text_width`). The function iterates over the words, appending them to a line until adding another word would exceed the maximum allowed width. \n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_lines = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= current_line == \"\" ? word : \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Don't forget to push the last line\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Example Use:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a sample text that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\n\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\nThis is a\nsample\ntext that\nneeds to\nbe\nwrapped.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function splits the input `text` into words.\n- It iterates over those words, appending them to the `current_line` until appending the next word would exceed the `text_width`.\n- If adding the next word exceeds the allowed width, the `current_line` is pushed to the `wrapped_lines` array and starts a new line.\n- Finally, all the lines are joined with a newline character and returned as a single string.\n\nFeel free to adjust the `text_width` as needed!","status":200,"tokens":[58,362],"elapsed":4.024991625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1241734522,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
