Below is a function definition for `wrap_string` in Julia. This function takes a string and wraps it so that no line exceeds a specified `text_width`.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(input)  # Split the input string into words\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        if current_line_length + word_length + 1 > text_width\n            # Adding the word would exceed the text width, so start a new line\n            result *= \"\\n\" * word\n            current_line_length = word_length\n        else\n            # Add a space before the word if it's not the first word in line\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                result *= \" \" * word\n                current_line_length += word_length + 1  # +1 for the space\n            else\n                result *= word\n                current_line_length = word_length\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"This is a sample string that we want to wrap to a specified width\"\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(input_string, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_string)\n```\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```\nThis is a \nsample \nstring \nthat we \nwant to \nwrap to a \nspecified \nwidth\n```\n\nThis function breaks the input string into words, and then it constructs the output string line by line, ensuring that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width`. Each word is added to the current line as long as the addition doesn't exceed the allowed width. If adding a word would exceed the allowed width, it starts a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[58,369],"elapsed":3.4090565,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-189923429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
