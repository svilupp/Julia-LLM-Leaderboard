[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Define the function `wrap_string` with two parameters: `input_string` and `text_width` (defaulting to 10).\n2. Split `input_string` into words.\n3. Iterate through the words while maintaining a buffer for the current line.\n4. Add words to the buffer until adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n5. When the width is exceeded, append the buffered words to the result and reset the buffer.\n6. Return the constructed string with inserted newlines.\n\n### Example:\nIf input string is \"This is a sample string for wrapping\" and text width is 10, the output should be:\n```\nThis is a\nsample\nstring for\nwrapping\n```\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_string::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(input_string)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the specified width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line == \"\"\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Append any remaining text in the current line buffer\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a sample string for wrapping\", 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function splits the input string into words.\n- It iterates over each word, checking if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width.\n- If it would exceed, it adds the current line to the result with a newline and starts a new line with the current word.\n- If not, it just concatenates the word.\n- Finally, it appends any remaining text in the current line buffer to the result.\n\nDouble-checking:\n- Test the function with different input strings and text widths to ensure accuracy and edge cases. For example, consider strings that already contain newlines or very long words that exceed the width.","status":200,"tokens":[316,578],"elapsed":5.351402416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1292077402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
