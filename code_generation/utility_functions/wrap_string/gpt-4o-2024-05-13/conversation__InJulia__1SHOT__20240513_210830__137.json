Below is an implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia, which wraps a string of text so that each line does not exceed a given `text_width`. The function iterates over words and adds a new line when the current line length plus the next word length would exceed the specified width.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # If adding the word would exceed the text width, start a new line\n        if current_line_length + word_length + 1 > text_width + 1\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n            current_line_length = word_length\n        else\n            # Add a space if this is not the first word in the line\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n            current_line_length += word_length\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Don't forget to add the last line\n    push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is an example of text that we want to wrap according to a specified text width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run the example provided, `wrap_string` function will wrap the text to fit within the specified width of 10 characters per line. Here is an example of what the output might look like for the provided `text`:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample of\ntext that\nwe want to\nwrap\naccording\nto a\nspecified\ntext width.\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes words longer than the `text_width` will exceed the width limit in isolation, but does not break individual words between lines. If needed, you could extend this function to handle exceedingly long words by implementing additional logic to split words themselves.","status":200,"tokens":[58,447],"elapsed":5.173909959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1397650581,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
