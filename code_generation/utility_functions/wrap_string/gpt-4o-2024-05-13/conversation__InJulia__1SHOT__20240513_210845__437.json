Here's a function in Julia called `wrap_string` that takes an input string and wraps it such that no line exceeds a specified `text_width`. By default, the `text_width` is set to 10.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line == \"\"\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(wrapped_lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example Usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function will split the input text by spaces into words, and then it will iterate through those words, assembling lines of text that do not exceed the specified `text_width`. When adding another word would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line.\n\nHere is how the output may look for the given example with the default `text_width` of 10:\n\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-level,\nhigh-perform\nance\nprogrammin\ng language\nfor\ntechnical\ncomputing.\n```\n\nRemember that if you want a different `text_width`, you can specify it as an argument when calling the function, e.g., `wrap_string(text; text_width=15)`.","status":200,"tokens":[58,361],"elapsed":4.113553084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1236378251,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
