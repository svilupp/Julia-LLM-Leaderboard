[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write a function `wrap_string` in Julia that takes a string and a maximum text width. The function will iterate over the words of the string and add a new line each time the maximum text width is exceeded. I'll also provide an example to illustrate its usage.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * '\\n'\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if current_line == \"\"\n            current_line *= word\n        else\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is a simple example to demonstrate the text wrapping functionality.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\nAnd here is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Splitting the text into words**: The text is split into individual words using the `split` function.\n2. **Initializing variables**: Two strings, `current_line` and `wrapped_text`, are initialized. `current_line` will track the current line being built, and `wrapped_text` will store the output.\n3. **Iterating over words**: We iterate over each word. If adding a word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, the `current_line` is added to `wrapped_text` with a newline character, and `current_line` is reset.\n4. **Handling word addition**: Words are added to `current_line`. If `current_line` is not empty, a space is added before the word.\n5. **Output the final line**: After the loop, any remaining text in `current_line` is added to `wrapped_text`.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates this function with a sample text and a maximum text width of 10 characters. The result is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[315,440],"elapsed":4.185131416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1618698203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
