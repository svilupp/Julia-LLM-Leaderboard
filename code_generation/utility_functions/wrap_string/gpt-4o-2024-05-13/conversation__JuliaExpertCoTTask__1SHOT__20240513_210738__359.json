Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task systematically:\n\n1. **Define the Function**:\n   - Create a function `wrap_string` that accepts a string `text` and an optional integer `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n   \n2. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Use a variable to keep track of the current line length.\n   - Use a list to accumulate words for the current line.\n   - Use a list to store the final lines.\n   \n3. **Iterate Over Words**:\n   - Split the input text into words.\n   - Iterate over each word and determine if adding this word would exceed the `text_width`.\n\n4. **Handle Line Breaks**:\n   - If the addition of the current word exceeds `text_width`, add the current line to the final lines list and start a new line.\n   - If not, add the word to the current line.\n\n5. **Final Steps**:\n   - Add the last accumulated line to the final lines list.\n   - Join the final lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    lines = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The `wrap_string` function takes a `text` and optionally a `text_width`.\n- The `split` function breaks the text into words.\n- Loop through the words and manage the line length.\n- When current_line exceeds `text_width`, push it into `lines` and reset `current_line`.\n- Finally, join all lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\n**Example Output**:\n\nFor the given data:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThe output should be:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[162,502],"elapsed":5.498703917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1904390141,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
