[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the task, we will write a Julia function `wrap_string` that takes a string and a maximum text width. It will then iterate over the words of the string and insert newlines whenever adding another word would exceed the specified text width. Let's implement this systematically step by step:\n\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words, concatenating them to a current line until adding another word would exceed the specified text width.\n3. When the text width is exceeded, append the current line to the result and start a new line with the current word.\n4. Handle any remaining words after the loop.\n\nHere's the completed function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Split the string into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"  # Append the current line to the result\n            current_line = word * \" \"  # Start a new line with the current word\n        elseif current_line == \"\"\n            current_line *= word * \" \"  # Start with the first word\n        else\n            current_line *= word * \" \"  # Continue adding to the current line\n        end\n    end\n\n    result *= current_line  # Append any remaining words to the result\n\n    return strip(result)  # Remove any trailing spaces\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is an example string to demonstrate how wrapping works at a given width limit.\", 15))\n```\n\nThis function will properly wrap the input string such that no line exceeds the specified text width. Let's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\ninput_text = \"This is an example string to demonstrate how wrapping works at a given width limit.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(input_text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe expected output for the example provided above, based on a width limit of 15, might look like:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample string\nto demonstrate\nhow wrapping\nworks at a\ngiven width\nlimit.\n```\n\nBy ensuring to handle the case where the current word won't fit in the current line, and properly managing spaces and new lines, this function adheres closely to the problem's requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[315,500],"elapsed":5.027438167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-854121003,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
