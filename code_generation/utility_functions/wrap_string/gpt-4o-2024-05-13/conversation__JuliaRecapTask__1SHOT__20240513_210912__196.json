[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If it wouldn't, we append the word to the current line. If it would, we store the current line and start a new one with the word.\n- **Handle Line Breaks**: We store each completed line in the `lines` array and start a new line as necessary.\n- **Construct the Result**: We join the lines with newline characters to create the final wrapped string.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `wrap_string` function with a sample text and a specified text width. The result is printed to show how the text has been wrapped according to the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[315,570],"elapsed":5.148294417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1720173378,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
