[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The words should be preserved as much as possible without breaking them in the middle.\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Iterate over words**: Split the input string into words.\n2. **Check the length of the current line**: Initialize an empty string for the current line and keep adding words to it.\n3. **Insert newline when necessary**: If adding another word exceeds the maximum width, add the current line to the result and start a new line.\n4. **Return the result**: Join all lines with newline characters.\n\nWe'll use Julia's built-in functions for splitting and joining strings, and handle the word wrapping logic with a loop.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result = result * \"\\n\" * current_line\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    result = result * \"\\n\" * current_line  # add the last line\n    \n    return result[2:end]  # remove the leading newline\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is an example string that will be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `split(text)`: Splits the input text into words.\n- `length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width`: Checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the specified width (we add 1 to account for the space between words).\n- `isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word`: If the current line is empty, add the word directly. Otherwise, add a space before adding the word.\n- `\"\\n\" * current_line`: Add the current line to the result, separated by newline.\n- `return result[2:end]`: The final result will have an extra leading newline, which we remove by taking the substring from the second character to the end.\n\nLet's run this with the given example:\n```julia\nexample_text = \"This is an example string that will be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 10))\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nThis is an\nexample\nstring\nthat will\nbe\nwrapped.\n```\n\nThis handles word wrapping correctly so that each line does not exceed the specified maximum width.","status":200,"tokens":[315,587],"elapsed":7.592868375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1314447543,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
