Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Function Signature:** Define `wrap_string` function with parameters `text` and `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. **Initialize Variables:** Use a variable to keep track of the current line length, and an array to store lines.\n3. **Iterate Over Words:** Split the input `text` into words and iterate over them.\n4. **Check Length:** For each word, check if the length of the current line plus the length of the word exceeds `text_width`.\n   - If it does, add the current line to the result and reset the current line.\n   - If it doesn't, add the word to the current line.\n5. **Handle Last Line:** After the iteration, add any remaining words in the current line to the result.\n6. **Join Lines:** Combine the lines with newline characters.\n7. **Return Result:** Output the final string.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line == \"\"\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Splitting Text:** The function splits the input text into a list of words.\n- **Building Lines:** It builds lines up to the `text_width` limit.\n- **Line Transition:** If adding another word would exceed the limit, it starts a new line.\n- **Edge Case:** Any remaining words after the loop are added to the result.\n\n### Example Output:\n\nWhen `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")` is called with default `text_width=10`, the output would be:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[162,467],"elapsed":5.503184042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2003954587,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
