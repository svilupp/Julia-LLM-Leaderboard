Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate through these words, adding them to the current line.\n3. Check if adding a word would exceed the maximum text width.\n4. If the maximum width would be exceeded, append the current line to a list of lines and start a new line with the current word.\n5. Finally, join the lines with newline characters.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= current_line == \"\" ? word : \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe function `wrap_string` should wrap the given sentence into multiple lines without exceeding the specified text width. Let's test it with the provided example.","status":200,"tokens":[162,251],"elapsed":2.704850375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":685597346,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
