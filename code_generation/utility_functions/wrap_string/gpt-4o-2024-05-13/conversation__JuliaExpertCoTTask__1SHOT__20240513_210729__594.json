Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. Define the function `wrap_string`.\n2. Initialize variables:\n   - `current_line` to track the current line of text.\n   - `result` to store the final wrapped text.\n3. Split the input string into words.\n4. Iterate over each word, and for each word:\n   - Check if appending the word to `current_line` would exceed `text_width`.\n   - If it does, add `current_line` to `result` and reset `current_line`.\n   - Append the word to `current_line`.\n5. After the loop, add any remaining text in `current_line` to `result`.\n6. Return the wrapped text by joining the lines in `result` with newline characters.\n\nHereâ€™s the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(result, current_line)  # Add the last line\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly wraps the words into lines, ensuring that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[162,355],"elapsed":4.721374208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1341732323,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
