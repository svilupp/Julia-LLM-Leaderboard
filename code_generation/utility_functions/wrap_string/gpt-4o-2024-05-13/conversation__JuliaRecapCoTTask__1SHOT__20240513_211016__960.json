[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

We'll iterate over words in a given string and insert new lines when the `text_width` is exceeded.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words, maintaining a running count of the current line length.\n3. Add words to the current line until the addition of a new word would exceed `text_width`, at which point we'll move to the next line.\n4. Join the lines with newline characters and return the resulting string.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words based on whitespace\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line == \"\"\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)  # Push the last line to the list of lines\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- We use `split` to break the input string into words.\n- We maintain `current_line` to collect words for the current line.\n- We check the length of `current_line` plus the length of the next word and a space. If the combined length exceeds `text_width`, we push the `current_line` to the `lines` array and start a new `current_line`.\n- We handle edge cases like an empty `current_line` to avoid leading spaces.\n\nLet's run the example with `text_width=10` and see how it works.","status":200,"tokens":[316,427],"elapsed":3.988406083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-887799395,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
