[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input text into words and iterates over them. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it would, the current line is added to the `wrapped_text` array and a new line is started. If the word can be added to the current line without exceeding the maximum width, it is added with a space before it. After the loop, the last line is added to the `wrapped_text` array if it is not empty. Finally, the function returns the wrapped text as a single string with newlines between the lines.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> text = \"This is an example of a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\n\"This is an example of a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\n\njulia> wrap_string(text, 20)\n\"This is an example of\\na long string that\\nneeds to be wrapped.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the input text is wrapped at 20 characters per line. The output is a single string with newlines between the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[373,479],"elapsed":30.504507541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1785179256,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
