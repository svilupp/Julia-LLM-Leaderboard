It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        if !isempty(line)\n            line *= \" \"\n        end\n        line *= word\n    end\n    if !isempty(line)\n        push!(lines, line)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words, then iterating over the words and adding them to a line. If adding a word to the line would make the line longer than `text_width`, the line is added to the list of lines and a new line is started. The function returns the lines joined together with newline characters.\n\nHere is an example of using the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> println(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nIn this example, the function wraps the input string into lines of at most 10 characters each.","status":200,"tokens":[188,309],"elapsed":7.831969084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1511262653,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
