It splits the input string into words and then iterates over the words, adding them to a `current_line` string. If adding a word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the `current_line` to a `wrapped_lines` array and resets the `current_line`. Finally, it joins the `wrapped_lines` with newline characters and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[188,459],"elapsed":15.314132667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1560104620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
