[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input string into words and then iterates over the words. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it would, the current line is added to the `wrapped_text` array and a new line is started. If the word can be added to the current line without exceeding the maximum width, it is added to the line. After all words have been processed, the final line is added to the `wrapped_text` array. The function then returns the `wrapped_text` array as a single string with newlines between the lines.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```julia\njulia> text = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped at a maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n\"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped at a maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n\njulia> wrap_string(text, 10)\n\"This is\\na long\\nstring\\nthat\\nneeds to\\nbe wrapped\\nat a\\nmaximum\\nwidth of\\n10\\ncharacters.\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the input string is wrapped at a maximum width of 10 characters. The output is a single string with newlines between the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[373,494],"elapsed":16.855147917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1830605917,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
