[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The `wrap_string` function takes two arguments: the `text` to be wrapped (as an `AbstractString`) and an optional `text_width` (defaulting to 10).\n2. The `split` function is used to split the `text` into an array of `words`.\n3. An empty array `wrapped_lines` is initialized to store the wrapped lines.\n4. A `current_line` variable is used to keep track of the current line being built.\n5. The function iterates over each `word` in the `words` array.\n6. If adding the current `word` to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, the `current_line` is added to `wrapped_lines`, and a new `current_line` is started with the current `word`.\n7. Otherwise, the `word` is appended to `current_line` with a space.\n8. After iterating over all words, the final `current_line` is added to `wrapped_lines`.\n9. The `join` function is used to concatenate the `wrapped_lines` with newline characters (`\\n`) to create the wrapped text.\n10. The wrapped text is returned as a `String`.\n\nFeel free to modify the function as per your requirements, such as handling special cases or adding additional functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[344,608],"elapsed":10.6090535,"cost":0.010152,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3327,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
