The `wrap_string` function takes a string `text` and an optional `text_width` (default is 10).\n2. The string is split into words using `split(text)`.\n3. An empty vector `wrapped_text` is initialized to store the wrapped lines.\n4. A variable `curr_line` is used to keep track of the current line being built.\n5. The function iterates over each word in the string.\n6. If the length of the current line plus the length of the current word is less than or equal to `text_width`, the word is appended to the current line with a space character in between.\n7. If the addition of the current word would exceed `text_width`, the current line is pushed to the `wrapped_text` vector, and `curr_line` is reset to the current word.\n8. After the loop, if `curr_line` is not empty, it is pushed to `wrapped_text`.\n9. The `wrapped_text` vector is joined by newline characters `\\n` and returned as a string.\n\nIn the example, the string `\"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped\"` is passed with a `text_width` of 10. The function wraps the text at appropriate positions to ensure that each line does not exceed the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[94,520],"elapsed":8.735173458,"cost":0.008082,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8828,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
