It first splits the text into individual words using the `split` function. Then, it iterates over each word and checks if adding the current word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, the `current_line` is added to the `lines` array, and the `current_line` is reset to the current word. Otherwise, the current word is concatenated to the `current_line` with a space. After processing all words, if there is a non-empty `current_line`, it is added to the `lines` array. Finally, the function returns the `lines` array joined by newline characters `\"\\n\"`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nsentence that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[94,387],"elapsed":6.2080345,"cost":0.006087,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26121,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
