The `wrap_string` function takes two arguments: the input text `text` and the maximum line width `text_width` (default is 10).\n2. It initializes two empty strings: `wrapped_text` to store the final wrapped text, and `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n3. It iterates over each word in the input text using `split(text)`.\n4. For each word, it checks if adding the word and a space to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it appends the `current_line` to `wrapped_text` followed by a newline character, and starts a new line with the current word.\n5. If the word can fit on the `current_line`, it appends the word to `current_line` with a preceding space.\n6. After iterating over all words, it appends the final `current_line` to `wrapped_text`.\n7. The wrapped text is returned as the result.\n\nIn the example usage, the input text is \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped at a certain width.\" and the maximum line width is set to 20. The wrapped text is printed, with each line not exceeding 20 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[94,487],"elapsed":10.411290333,"cost":0.007587,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5688,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
