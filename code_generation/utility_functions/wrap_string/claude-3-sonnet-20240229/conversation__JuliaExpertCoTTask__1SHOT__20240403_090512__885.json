The input text is split into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n2. An empty array `lines` is created to store the wrapped lines.\n3. A variable `current_line` is initialized as an empty string to store the current line being built.\n4. The function iterates over each word in the input text.\n5. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If so, the `current_line` is added to the `lines` array, and `current_line` is reset to the current word.\n6. If the word can fit in the `current_line`, it is appended to `current_line` with a leading space.\n7. After iterating over all words, if `current_line` is not empty, it is added to the `lines` array.\n8. Finally, the `lines` array is joined with newline characters (`\\n`) and returned as the wrapped text.\n\nThe function takes an optional keyword argument `text_width` to specify the maximum width of each line. If not provided, it defaults to 10.","status":200,"tokens":[168,487],"elapsed":8.83357325,"cost":0.007809,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23178,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
