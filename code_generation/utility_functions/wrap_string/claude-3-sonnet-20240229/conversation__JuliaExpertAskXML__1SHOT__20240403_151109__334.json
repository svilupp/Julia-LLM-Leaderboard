The function `wrap_string` takes a `String` `text` and an optional keyword argument `text_width` (defaulting to 10).\n2. The input `text` is split into individual words using `split(text)`.\n3. An empty array `wrapped` is initialized to store the wrapped lines.\n4. A variable `current_line` is initialized to an empty string to store the current line being built.\n5. The function iterates over each `word` in the input `text`.\n6. If adding the current `word` to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, the `current_line` is pushed to the `wrapped` array, and `current_line` is reset to the current `word`.\n7. Otherwise, the `word` is appended to the `current_line` with a space in between.\n8. After iterating over all words, the final `current_line` is pushed to the `wrapped` array.\n9. The `wrapped` array of lines is joined with newlines `\"\\n\"` and returned as the wrapped string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that words should not be split across lines, and that lines will be filled as much as possible up to the `text_width` before wrapping to the next line.","status":200,"tokens":[99,559],"elapsed":9.895315833,"cost":0.008682,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13030,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
