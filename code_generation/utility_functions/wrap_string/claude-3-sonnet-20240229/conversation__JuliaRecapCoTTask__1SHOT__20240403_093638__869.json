[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The `wrap_string` function takes a string `text` and an optional `text_width` (defaulting to 10).\n2. It initializes an empty string `wrapped_text` to store the wrapped text, and an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n3. It splits the `text` into words using `split(text)`.\n4. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`.\n    - If it would exceed, it appends the `current_line` to the `wrapped_text` with a newline `\\n`, and starts a new `current_line` with the current word.\n    - If it would not exceed, it appends the word to the `current_line` with a space.\n5. After the loop, it appends the final `current_line` (without the trailing space) to the `wrapped_text`.\n6. The `wrapped_text` is returned.\n7. In the example, the text is wrapped at a `text_width` of 15, resulting in a new line after every 15 characters (taking into account word boundaries).\n\nNote: The function assumes that words are separated by whitespace characters. If you need to handle different word separators, you may need to modify the `split` function call accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[345,500],"elapsed":10.127837875,"cost":0.008535000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32147,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
