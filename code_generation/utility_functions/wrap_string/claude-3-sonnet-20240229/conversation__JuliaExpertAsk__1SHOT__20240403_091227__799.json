The `wrap_string` function takes two arguments: `text` (the string to be wrapped) and `text_width` (the maximum width of each line, defaulting to 10).\n2. An empty array `wrapped_text` is created to store the wrapped lines, and `current_line` is initialized as an empty string.\n3. The input `text` is split into words using the `split` function.\n4. For each word, we check if adding it to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If so, we append `current_line` to `wrapped_text` and start a new line with the current word.\n5. If the word can fit on the current line, we append it to `current_line` with a space.\n6. After iterating through all words, we append the final `current_line` to `wrapped_text`.\n7. The wrapped lines are joined with newline characters (`\\n`) and returned as a single string.\n\nIn the example, the text is wrapped at a maximum width of 15 characters per line.","status":200,"tokens":[94,439],"elapsed":8.845702791,"cost":0.006867000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
