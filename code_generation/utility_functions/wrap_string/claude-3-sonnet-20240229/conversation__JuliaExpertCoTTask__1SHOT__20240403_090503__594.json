The function takes a string `text` and an optional keyword argument `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. We initialize an empty vector `lines` to store the wrapped lines, and a `current_line` string.\n3. We split the `text` into individual words using `split(text)`.\n4. For each word, we check if adding it to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`.\n5. If it would exceed, we add the `current_line` to the `lines` vector and start a new `current_line` with the current word.\n6. If it would not exceed, we append the word to the `current_line` with a preceding space.\n7. After iterating over all words, we add the final `current_line` to the `lines` vector.\n8. Finally, we join the `lines` vector with newline characters using `join(lines, \"\\n\")` and return the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[168,399],"elapsed":6.866745167,"cost":0.006489,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18531,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
