[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

First, we split the input `text` into an array of `words` using the `split` function with the delimiter `\" \"` (space).\n2. We initialize an empty array `wrapped_lines` to store the wrapped lines, and a `current_line` string to accumulate words.\n3. We iterate over each `word` in the `words` array.\n4. For each `word`, we check if adding it to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If so, we add the `current_line` to the `wrapped_lines` array and start a new line with the current `word`.\n5. If adding the `word` doesn't exceed the `text_width`, we append it to the `current_line` with a leading space.\n6. After iterating over all words, if there's any remaining text in `current_line`, we add it to the `wrapped_lines` array.\n7. Finally, we join the `wrapped_lines` array with the newline character `\"\\n\"` and return the resulting string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped to fit within a certain width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped to fit\nwithin a\ncertain width.\n```\n\nThis implementation assumes that words should not be split across lines. If you want to allow splitting words across lines, you'll need to modify the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[345,648],"elapsed":12.469617375,"cost":0.010754999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25178,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
