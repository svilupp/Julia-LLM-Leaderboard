The function `wrap_string` takes a string `text` and an optional keyword argument `text_width` (default is 10).\n2. It splits the `text` into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n3. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and a string `curr_line` to build the current line.\n4. It iterates over each word in the `words` array.\n5. If adding the current word to `curr_line` doesn't exceed `text_width`, it appends the word to `curr_line` with a leading space.\n6. If adding the current word to `curr_line` would exceed `text_width`, it pushes the previous `curr_line` (without the leading space) to `lines`, and resets `curr_line` to the current word.\n7. After the loop, it pushes the final `curr_line` (without the leading space) to `lines`.\n8. It joins the lines in `lines` with a newline character `\"\\n\"` and returns the resulting string.\n\nWith the provided example `\"This function will wrap words into lines\"`, the output is:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[168,503],"elapsed":8.852433375,"cost":0.008049,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4345,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
