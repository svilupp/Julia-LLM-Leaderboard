It splits the input string into words, and iterates over them. For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it appends the current line to the `wrapped` array and starts a new line with the current word. If not, it concatenates the word to the current line. After iterating through all words, it appends the remaining line to `wrapped` and joins all lines with a newline character `\\n`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,315],"elapsed":5.896164875,"cost":0.005022,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
