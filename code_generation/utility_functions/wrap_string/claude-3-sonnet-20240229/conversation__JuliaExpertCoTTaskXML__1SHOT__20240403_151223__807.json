If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line. Otherwise, it appends the word to the current line with a space. After iterating through all words, it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[202,296],"elapsed":5.749231334,"cost":0.005046,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26299,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
