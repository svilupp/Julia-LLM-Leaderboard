[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The `wrap_string` function takes a string `text` and an optional keyword argument `text_width` (defaulting to 10) that specifies the maximum width of each line.\n2. It splits the input `text` into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n3. An empty array `wrapped_lines` is initialized to store the wrapped lines, and a `current_line` string is used to accumulate words.\n4. The function iterates over each word in the `words` array.\n5. For each word, it checks if adding the word to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If so, it appends the `current_line` to `wrapped_lines` and starts a new `current_line` with the current word.\n6. If the word can fit on the `current_line`, it concatenates the word to `current_line` with a space in between.\n7. After iterating through all words, the final `current_line` is appended to `wrapped_lines`.\n8. The wrapped lines in `wrapped_lines` are joined with a newline character `\\n` using `join(wrapped_lines, '\\n')`, which produces the formatted string with line breaks.\n9. In the example, the input text is wrapped with a maximum width of 20 characters per line.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that words should not be broken across lines. If you want to allow breaking long words, you would need to modify the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[345,551],"elapsed":11.56456325,"cost":0.0093,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22366,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
