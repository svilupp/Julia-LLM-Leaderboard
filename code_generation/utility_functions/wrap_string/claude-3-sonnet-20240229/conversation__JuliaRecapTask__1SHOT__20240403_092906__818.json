[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The input string is split into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n2. An empty array `wrapped_text` is created to store the wrapped lines.\n3. A `current_line` string is initialized as an empty string to store the words of the current line.\n4. For each word in the `words` array:\n   - If adding the length of the current word and a space to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, the `current_line` is appended to the `wrapped_text` array, and the `current_line` is reset to the current word.\n   - Otherwise, the current word is appended to the `current_line` with a space.\n5. After iterating through all words, if the `current_line` is not empty, it is appended to the `wrapped_text` array.\n6. Finally, the wrapped lines in the `wrapped_text` array are joined with newline characters `\"\\n\"` and returned as a single string.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped at a certain width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped at a\ncertain width.\n```\n\nIn this example, the input string is wrapped at a width of 15 characters, resulting in the wrapped string with multiple lines.","status":200,"tokens":[344,545],"elapsed":10.943829833,"cost":0.009207,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23986,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
