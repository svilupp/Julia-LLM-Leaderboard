The `wrap_string` function takes a string `text` and an optional `text_width` parameter (default is 10).\n2. It splits the `text` into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n3. It creates two `IOBuffer` objects: `current_line` to store the current line being built and `result` to store the final wrapped text.\n4. It iterates over each word in the `words` array.\n5. For each word, it checks if adding it to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`.\n6. If it would exceed the `text_width`, it writes the contents of `current_line` to `result`, adds a newline character, and starts a new line with the current word.\n7. If it wouldn't exceed the `text_width`, it appends the word to `current_line` with a preceding space.\n8. After iterating over all words, it writes the remaining contents of `current_line` to `result`.\n9. Finally, it converts the `result` `IOBuffer` to a string and returns it.\n\nThe `IOBuffer` is an efficient way to handle string manipulation in Julia, as it avoids unnecessary memory allocations and copies.","status":200,"tokens":[94,532],"elapsed":9.701713458,"cost":0.008262,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26366,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
