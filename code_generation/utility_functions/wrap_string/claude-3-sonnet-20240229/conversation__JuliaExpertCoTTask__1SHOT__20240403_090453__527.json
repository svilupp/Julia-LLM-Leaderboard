The input string is split into an array of words using `split(text)`.\n2. An empty string `line` is initialized to store the current line.\n3. The function iterates over each word in the array.\n4. If adding the current word to the `line` would exceed the `text_width`, the `line` is added to the `lines` array, and `line` is set to the current word.\n5. Otherwise, the current word is appended to `line` with a space in between.\n6. After iterating over all words, the final `line` is added to the `lines` array.\n7. The `lines` array is joined into a single string with newline characters `\\n` in between.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function with the provided text and the default `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[168,415],"elapsed":6.833067334,"cost":0.006729000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6431,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
