It first splits the input text into words. Then, it iterates over each word and checks if adding the current word to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If it does, a newline character is added to the `wrapped_text` string, and the `current_line_length` is reset to the length of the current word. Otherwise, the current word is appended to the `wrapped_text` string, and the `current_line_length` is incremented accordingly.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `wrapped_text` string with leading/trailing whitespace removed using `strip`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,400],"elapsed":7.659136834,"cost":0.0062970000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27026,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
