When the line width is exceeded, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started. The function returns the joined lines with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[176,334],"elapsed":20.45768975,"cost":0.00011816000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-503714029,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
