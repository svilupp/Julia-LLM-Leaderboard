It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that accomplishes the task you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = Vector{String}()\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        if isempty(current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return lines\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to wrap a string into lines of a specified width. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\n\nfor line in wrapped_text\n    println(line)\nend\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function splits the input text into words, then iterates over the words, adding them to the current line until the line length exceeds the specified `text_width`. When the line length is exceeded, the current line is added to the list of lines and a new line is started. The function returns a vector of strings, each representing a line of the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[97,371],"elapsed":22.546936375,"cost":0.00011746,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1734627820,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
