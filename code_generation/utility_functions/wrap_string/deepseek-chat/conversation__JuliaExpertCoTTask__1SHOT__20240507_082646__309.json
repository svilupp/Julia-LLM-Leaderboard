If adding the word would exceed the `text_width`, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started with the current word. After all words have been processed, any remaining line is added to the list of lines, and the lines are joined together with newline characters to form the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[176,365],"elapsed":23.1789,"cost":0.00012684,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-359852303,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
