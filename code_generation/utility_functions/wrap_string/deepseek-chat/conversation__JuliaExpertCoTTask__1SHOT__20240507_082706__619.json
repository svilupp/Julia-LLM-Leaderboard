It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = Vector{String}(undef, 0)\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        if current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return lines\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to wrap a string into lines of a specified width.

The function returns a vector of strings, where each string represents a line of text.","status":200,"tokens":[176,332],"elapsed":19.206241917,"cost":0.00011760000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":704860379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
