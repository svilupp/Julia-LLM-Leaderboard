It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= \"$word\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a\nlong\nsentence\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nThis function splits the input text into words, then iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the specified text width, it starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. Finally, it joins all the lines with newline characters and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[97,322],"elapsed":22.240221291,"cost":0.00010374,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":52230509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
