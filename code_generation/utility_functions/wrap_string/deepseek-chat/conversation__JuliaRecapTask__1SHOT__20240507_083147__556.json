[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the specified text width, it starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the current word to the current line. Finally, it joins all the lines with newline characters and returns the result.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a\nlong\nsentence\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[345,291],"elapsed":18.383149542,"cost":0.00012978,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2104382693,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
