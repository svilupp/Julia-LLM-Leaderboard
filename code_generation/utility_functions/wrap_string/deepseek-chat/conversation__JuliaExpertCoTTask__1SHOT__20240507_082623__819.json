If adding the next word would exceed the width, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started with the next word. The function returns a list of lines.","status":200,"tokens":[176,346],"elapsed":21.054494875,"cost":0.00012152000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1700840150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
