Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(s, text_width=30)\nprintln(wrapped_string)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a very long string that\nneeds to be wrapped. Julia is a\nhigh-level, high-performance,\ndynamic programming language for\ntechnical computing.\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function splits the input string into words, then iterates over the words. If adding the current word to the line would exceed the maximum text width, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line. At the end, it joins the lines together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[98,338],"elapsed":3.794170709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-251428321,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
