[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function takes a string `s` and an optional argument `text_width` which specifies the maximum width of each line. The default value of `text_width` is 10.\n2. The string `s` is split into an array of words using the `split` function.\n3. An empty array `lines` is created to store the wrapped lines. An empty string `line` is created to store the current line that is being built.\n4. The function iterates over the array of words and for each word it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum width. If it would, then the current line is added to the `lines` array and a new empty line is started.\n5. The word is then added to the current line, with a space character inserted before it if the current line is not empty.\n6. After all the words have been processed, the last line is added to the `lines` array.\n7. Finally, the wrapped lines are joined together into a single string using the `join` function and the `\\n` character as the separator, and the resulting string is returned.\n\nI hope this helps!
