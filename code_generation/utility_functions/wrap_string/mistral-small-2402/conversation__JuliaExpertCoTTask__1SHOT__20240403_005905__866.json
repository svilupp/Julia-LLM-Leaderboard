Split the input text into words using the `split` function.\n2. Initialize an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and an empty string `line` to accumulate words.\n3. Iterate over the words and check if the length of the current line plus the length of the current word plus one (for the space character) exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, add the current line to the `lines` array and start a new line with the current word.\n4. If the length of the current line does not exceed the maximum text width, append a space and the current word to the current line.\n5. After processing all the words, add the final line to the `lines` array and join all the lines into a single string with newline characters using the `join` function.\n6. Return the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[179,429],"elapsed":7.987131417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":137089895,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
