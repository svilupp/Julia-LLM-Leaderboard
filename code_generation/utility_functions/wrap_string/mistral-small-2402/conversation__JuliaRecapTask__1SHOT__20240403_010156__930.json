[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over these words, adding each one to a current line. If adding a word would exceed the text width, it appends the current line to the output, starts a new line, and adds the word to the new line. Finally, it appends the last line to the output and returns the result.\n\nThe output of the example usage would be:\n\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that needs\nto be wrapped\nbecause it exceeds\nthe text width.\n```\n\nThis solution uses Julia's 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch, and standard library functions. It also uses general type annotations and emphasizes performance and clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[364,424],"elapsed":9.583764959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1353874805,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
