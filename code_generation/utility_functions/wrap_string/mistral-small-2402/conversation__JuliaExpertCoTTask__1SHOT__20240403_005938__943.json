It splits the input string into words and stores them in an array. Then it iterates over the words and adds each word to a line string. If the length of the line string plus the length of the current word plus one (for the space character) exceeds the text width, it adds the line string to an array of lines and starts a new line with the current word. After all words have been processed, it adds the last line string to the array of lines and joins the lines with a newline character to return the final result.","status":200,"tokens":[179,351],"elapsed":3.799933084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1735537864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
