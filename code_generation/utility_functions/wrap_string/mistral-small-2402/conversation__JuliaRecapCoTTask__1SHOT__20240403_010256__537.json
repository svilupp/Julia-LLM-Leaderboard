[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It should wrap the string at a specified width, in this case, 20 characters.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s, text_width=20))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a test to\nsee how the string\nwrapping function\nworks. It should\nwrap the string at\na specified width,\nin this case, 20\ncharacters.\n```\n\nThe function works by splitting the input string into words, then building up lines of text by adding words to the current line until the width of the line would be exceeded by adding another word. When the width is exceeded, the current line is added to the output lines and a new empty line is started. After all words have been processed, the last line is added to the output lines, and the output lines are joined together with newline characters to produce the final output string.\n\nIn this solution, I have used the `split` function to split the input string into words, and the `join` function to join the output lines together. I have also used the `push!` function to add lines to the output lines array, and the `*=` operator to concatenate words onto the current line. The function takes an optional `text_width` argument, which defaults to 10 characters.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the function's steps:\n\n1. Split the input string into words using the `split` function.\n2. Initialize an empty array to hold the output lines, and an empty string to hold the current line.\n3. Loop over the words, and for each word:\n    a. Check if adding the word to the current line would exceed the specified text width. If so, add the current line to the output lines and start a new empty line.\n    b. Add a space to the current line (unless it's empty), then add the word to the current line.\n4. Add the last line to the output lines.\n5. Join the output lines together with newline characters to produce the final output string.\n6. Return the output string.\n\nThe function uses general type annotations for the input string and the `text_width` argument to make it flexible and reusable. It also uses multiple dispatch to handle different types of input strings (e.g. `String` and `SubString`). The function prioritizes performance and clarity, and avoids using unnecessary packages or dependencies.","status":200,"tokens":[366,713],"elapsed":7.701289875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1788048672,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
