It then iterates over the words, adding each one to a line string, and checking if the combined length of the line and the current word would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, it adds the current line to the `wrapped_lines` array, resets the line to the current word, and continues. If not, it appends the word to the line with a space in between. After all words have been processed, it adds the final line to the `wrapped_lines` array and returns the result as a single string with newline characters separating the lines.\n\nThe default `text_width` is 10, but this can be changed by providing a different value for the `text_width` keyword argument.","status":200,"tokens":[179,392],"elapsed":4.281526125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-928266057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
