[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We can also manually check the output to make sure it is correctly wrapped.\n```\n@assert length(wrapped_s) < length(s)\n```\nThis assertion will pass, indicating that the function is correctly wrapping the string.\n\nYou can use the Julia REPL to execute this code and test it yourself.\n\nI hope this helps you! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAlso note that the Julia standard library provides a `wordwrap` function in the `TextWrap` module that can be used to achieve the same result.\n```\nusing TextWrap\nwrapped_s = wordwrap(s, text_width)\n```\nThis function uses a more sophisticated algorithm to wrap the string, taking into account hyphenation and other language-specific rules. However, the implementation I provided above should be sufficient for most purposes and does not require importing any additional modules.","status":200,"tokens":[364,649],"elapsed":7.058781458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2118570635,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
