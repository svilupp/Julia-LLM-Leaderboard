It keeps track of the current line, and if adding the next word would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the current line to the `lines` array and starts a new line. At the end, it joins all the lines together with newline characters to produce the output string.\n\nThis function assumes that the input string is already properly formatted with spaces between words. If that is not the case, additional pre-processing may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[179,330],"elapsed":6.355352833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-655820068,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
