[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    lines = [\"\"]\n    for word in split(s)\n        if length(lines[end]) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        if !isempty(lines[end])\n            lines[end] *= \" \"\n        end\n        lines[end] *= word\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string `s` and a maximum text width `text_width` as arguments, and returns a new string with line breaks inserted as necessary to fit within the specified text width.\n\nHere is an example of how the function can be used:\n```\ns = \"This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long string\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s, 20))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a very very\nvery very very very\nvery very very very\nvery very very very\nlong string\n```\nThe function works by splitting the input string into words, and then iterating over the words and adding them to a list of lines. If the length of the current line plus the length of the next word plus one (for the space between words) would exceed the maximum text width, a new line is started. The function then returns the lines joined together with line breaks.\n\nThe function uses the `split` function to split the string into words, and the `join` function to join the lines together with line breaks. The `length` function is used to check the length of the current line and the next word, and the `push!` function is used to add a new line to the list of lines.\n\nThe function uses the `*=` operator to concatenate strings, and the `isempty` function to check if the current line is empty.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: I noticed that the `split` function by default splits on any whitespace, so if the input string contains multiple consecutive spaces or tabs, they will be treated as separate words. If you want to preserve consecutive whitespace, you can use a regular expression to split on one or more whitespace characters:\n```\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    lines = [\"\"]\n    for word in split(r\"\\s+\", s)\n        if length(lines[end]) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")\n        end\n        if !isempty(lines[end])\n            lines[end] *= \" \"\n        end\n        lines[end] *= word\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis should preserve any consecutive whitespace in the input string.","status":200,"tokens":[366,671],"elapsed":7.530113375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":415639595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
