[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It keeps track of the current line as a string, and appends each word to it with a space in between. If the length of the current line plus the length of the next word plus one (for the space) exceeds the specified text width, it adds the current line to an array of wrapped lines and starts a new line with the next word. Finally, it adds the last line to the array of wrapped lines and returns it.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the function with an input string and a text width of 20, and then print out each line of the wrapped string. The output should look like this:\n```\nThis is a long string\nthat needs to be\nwrapped to fit within\na specified text width.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[364,411],"elapsed":8.955521667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2144251460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
