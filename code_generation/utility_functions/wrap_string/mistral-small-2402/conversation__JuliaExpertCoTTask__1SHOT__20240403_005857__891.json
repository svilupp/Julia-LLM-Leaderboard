If adding a word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width, a new line is started. The function returns the lines joined together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[179,262],"elapsed":2.903148333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":30047702,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
