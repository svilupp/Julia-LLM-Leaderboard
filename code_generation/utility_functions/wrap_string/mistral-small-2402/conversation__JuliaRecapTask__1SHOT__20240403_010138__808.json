[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input string into words and iterates over them. It keeps track of the length of the current line and adds each word to it if the total length of the line plus the next word does not exceed the text width. If the total length would exceed the text width, it adds the current line to a list of wrapped lines and starts a new line with the next word. After processing all the words, it returns the wrapped lines as a single string with newline characters between each line.\n\nThe provided example string will be wrapped and printed with a text width of 20.","status":200,"tokens":[364,409],"elapsed":4.513793334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":300074312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
