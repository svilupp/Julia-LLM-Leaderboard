[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over the words and checks if the length of the current line plus the length of the current word plus one (for the space between words) exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, it adds the current line to the result array and starts a new line with the current word. If it does not, it appends the current word to the current line with a space in between.\n\nAfter the loop, the function checks if the current line is not empty and adds it to the result array if necessary. Finally, it joins the elements of the result array into a single string with newline characters in between, and returns the result.\n\nThe function uses type annotations to specify the types of its input and output, and uses the abstract types AbstractString and Int to allow for any subtype of those types to be passed as input. The function also uses multiple dispatch to allow for different implementations of the function to be used depending on the types of its input.\n\nThe function emphasizes clarity and performance, and avoids using any new libraries or packages that are not part of the Julia standard library. The function uses 1-based indexing and multiple dispatch, which are distinguishing features of the Julia language.\n\nI hope this helps!
