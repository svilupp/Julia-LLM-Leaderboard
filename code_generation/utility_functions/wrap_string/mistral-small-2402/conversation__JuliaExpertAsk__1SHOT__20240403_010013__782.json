It then iterates over each word and adds it to the current line. If adding the next word would exceed the maximum text width, it pushes the current line to an array of wrapped lines and starts a new line with the next word. Finally, it joins all the wrapped lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[98,379],"elapsed":4.146190083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1968230923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
