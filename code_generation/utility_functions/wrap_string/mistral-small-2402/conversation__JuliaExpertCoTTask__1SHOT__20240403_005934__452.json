It then iterates through each word and checks if the length of the current line plus the length of the word and a space would exceed the given maximum text width. If it does, the function adds the current line to an output array and sets the new line to be the current word. If it doesn't, the function appends the word to the current line with a space. Finally, the function joins the output array with newline characters and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[179,347],"elapsed":6.711512292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":228789822,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
