The function `wrap_string` splits the input string into words, then iterates over the words and adds them to a line until the maximum width is exceeded. When the maximum width is exceeded, the function adds the current line to the result and starts a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[57,347],"elapsed":3.84970725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1163952576,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
