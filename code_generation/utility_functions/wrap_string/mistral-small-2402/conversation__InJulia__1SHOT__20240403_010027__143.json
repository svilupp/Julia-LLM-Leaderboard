Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\"\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow let's try an example with a maximum width of 10 characters:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long text that we want to wrap into multiple lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nThis is a\nlong text\nthat we\nwant to\nwrap into\nmultiple\nlines\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the words in the input text, keeping track of the current line length. When a new word would exceed the maximum width for the line, it adds the current line to the `lines` array and starts a new line with that word. Once all words have been processed, the `join` function is used to combine the lines into a single string, with each line separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[57,380],"elapsed":4.117851167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":936768603,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
