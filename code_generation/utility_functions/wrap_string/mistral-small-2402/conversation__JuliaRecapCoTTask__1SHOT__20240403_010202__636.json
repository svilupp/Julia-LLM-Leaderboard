[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then iterates over the words, adding each word to the current line and checking if the length of the current line plus the length of the next word plus the space between them exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with the next word. After it has iterated over all the words, it adds the last line to the list of lines and joins them together with newline characters to create the final wrapped text.\n\nThe function uses the `split` function from the Julia standard library to split the text into words, and the `join` function to join the lines back together. It also uses string concatenation with the `*=` operator to build up the current line. The function takes an optional `text_width` argument with a default value of 10, and it uses type annotations to specify that it takes an `AbstractString` as input and returns an `AbstractString` as output.","status":200,"tokens":[366,483],"elapsed":5.384071666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1016092369,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
