[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

When that happens, the `line` string is added to a `lines` array, and the `line` string is reset to an empty string. After all words have been processed, the final `line` string is added to the `lines` array, and the `lines` array is joined together into a single string using the `join` function with a newline character as the separator.\n\nThe example usage prints the wrapped string with a `text_width` of 20:\n\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that needs\nto be wrapped so\nthat it fits within\na certain width.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[366,393],"elapsed":4.374323417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1092861023,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
