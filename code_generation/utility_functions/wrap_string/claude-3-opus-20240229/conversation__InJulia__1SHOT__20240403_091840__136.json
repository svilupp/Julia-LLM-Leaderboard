Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia along with an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `text` (the input string) and `text_width` (the maximum width of each line, defaulting to 10).\n\n2. It splits the `text` into individual words using the `split` function.\n\n3. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and an empty string `current_line` to build each line.\n\n4. It iterates over each `word` in the `words` array:\n   - If adding the current `word` to `current_line` doesn't exceed `text_width`, it appends the word to `current_line` with a leading space.\n   - If adding the word exceeds `text_width`, it pushes the current `current_line` (after removing leading/trailing whitespace) to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the current word.\n\n5. After the loop, if there is any remaining content in `current_line`, it is pushed to the `lines` array.\n\n6. Finally, it joins the lines with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and returns the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a long string that needs to be wrapped. We pass the string to the `wrap_string` function with a `text_width` of 15. The function wraps the string by adding new lines whenever the maximum width of 15 characters would be exceeded. The resulting wrapped text is then printed.\n\nYou can adjust the `text_width` parameter to control the maximum width of each line in the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[57,582],"elapsed":22.784042459,"cost":0.044504999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15027,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
