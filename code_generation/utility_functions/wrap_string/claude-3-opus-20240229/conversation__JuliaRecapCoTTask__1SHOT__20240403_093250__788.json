[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Split the input text into words \n2. Initialize an array to store the output lines and a current line string\n3. Iterate through the words:\n   - If adding the current word to the current line doesn't exceed the max width, append it\n   - Otherwise, push the current line to the output array and start a new line with the current word\n4. After the loop, push any remaining content in the current line to the output\n5. Join the output lines array with newline characters\n\nI believe this implements the desired functionality. The function takes a string, optional max width, splits it into words, and inserts newlines to avoid exceeding the max width, wrapping long text over multiple lines.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[345,439],"elapsed":21.073130333,"cost":0.038099999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2996,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
