Approach:\n   - Split the input string into words\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the wrapped text\n   - Iterate over each word\n   - If adding the current word to the line exceeds the maximum text width:\n     - Add a new line character to the wrapped text\n     - Reset the current line to an empty string\n   - Append the current word to the current line\n   - After the loop, return the wrapped text\n\n2. Function and code:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= word * \" \"\n    end\n    \n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n    return rstrip(wrapped_text)\nend\n```\n\n3. Example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\n4. Solution correctness:\n   - The function splits the input string into words using `split(text)`.\n   - It initializes an empty string `wrapped_text` to store the wrapped text and an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n   - It iterates over each word using a `for` loop.\n   - Inside the loop, it checks if adding the current word to the `current_line` would exceed the maximum `text_width`.\n     - If it exceeds, it appends the `current_line` to `wrapped_text` followed by a new line character, and then resets `current_line` to an empty string.\n   - It appends the current word to `current_line` followed by a space.\n   - After the loop, it appends the remaining `current_line` to `wrapped_text`.\n   - Finally, it removes any trailing whitespace using `rstrip()` and returns the wrapped text.\n\nThe function correctly wraps the words into lines based on the specified `text_width` and returns the wrapped text as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[168,552],"elapsed":20.552111125,"cost":0.04392,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18985,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
