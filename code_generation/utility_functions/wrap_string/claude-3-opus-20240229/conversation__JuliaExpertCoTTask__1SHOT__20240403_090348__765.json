It splits the input `text` into individual words using `split(text)`.\n2. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines.\n3. It initializes an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n4. It iterates over each `word` in the `words` array:\n   - If adding the current `word` to the `current_line` doesn't exceed the `text_width`, it appends the word to the `current_line` with a space.\n   - If adding the current `word` to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, it pushes the `current_line` to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the current `word`.\n5. After iterating through all the words, if there is any remaining text in the `current_line`, it pushes it to the `lines` array.\n6. Finally, it joins the `lines` array with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and returns the wrapped string.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function wraps the words into lines based on the specified `text_width` parameter, which defaults to 10 characters per line.","status":200,"tokens":[168,514],"elapsed":19.935996291,"cost":0.041069999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28938,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
