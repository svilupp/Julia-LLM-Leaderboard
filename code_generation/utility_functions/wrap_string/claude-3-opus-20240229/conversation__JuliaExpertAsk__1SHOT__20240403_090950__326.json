It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `wrap_string` that wraps a string by adding a new line each time the maximum `text_width` would be exceeded:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= (isempty(current_line) ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It splits the input string `s` into words using the `split` function.\n\n2. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n\n3. It iterates over each word in the `words` array.\n\n4. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If it doesn't exceed the width, the word is appended to the `current_line` with a space separator (if the current line is not empty). If it exceeds the width, the `current_line` is pushed to the `lines` array, and the `current_line` is reset to the current word.\n\n5. After the loop, if there is any remaining content in `current_line`, it is pushed to the `lines` array.\n\n6. Finally, the function joins the `lines` array using a newline character `\\n` and returns the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function is called with the `text` string and a `text_width` of 15. The function wraps the string by adding new lines whenever the maximum width of 15 characters would be exceeded. The resulting wrapped string is then printed.","status":200,"tokens":[94,557],"elapsed":20.624838167,"cost":0.043185,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30238,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
