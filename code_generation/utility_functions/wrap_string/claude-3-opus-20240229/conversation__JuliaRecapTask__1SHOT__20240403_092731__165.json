[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We split the `text` into individual words using `split(text)`. \n\n2. We initialize an array `lines` to store the wrapped lines, and a `current_line` to build up each line.\n\n3. We iterate over each `word`:\n   - If adding the `word` to `current_line` doesn't exceed `text_width`, we append it (with a space if `current_line` isn't empty).\n   - If it would exceed `text_width`, we push the `current_line` to `lines` and start a new line with `word`.\n\n4. After the loop, we push any remaining `current_line` to `lines`.\n\n5. Finally we `join` the `lines` array with newline characters `\"\\n\"` and return the result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Hello world, how are you doing today? I hope you're having a fantastic day!\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nHello\nworld, how \nare you\ndoing\ntoday? I\nhope you're \nhaving a\nfantastic\nday!\n```\n\nThis wraps the long input text to a maximum of 10 characters per line by adding line breaks between words as needed.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[344,465],"elapsed":22.221948291,"cost":0.040034999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27956,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
