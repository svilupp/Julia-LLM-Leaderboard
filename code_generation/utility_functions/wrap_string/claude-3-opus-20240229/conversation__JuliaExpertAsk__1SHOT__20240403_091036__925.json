Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= isempty(current_line) ? word : \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function takes a string `text` as input and an optional keyword argument `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n- It splits the `text` into individual words using `split(text)`.\n- It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and an empty string `current_line` to build each line.\n- It iterates over each `word` in `words`:\n  - If the length of the `current_line` plus the length of the `word` plus 1 (for the space) is less than or equal to `text_width`, it appends the `word` to the `current_line` with a space if the `current_line` is not empty.\n  - If the length exceeds `text_width`, it pushes the `current_line` to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the current `word`.\n- After the loop, if there is any remaining content in `current_line`, it is pushed to the `lines` array.\n- Finally, it joins the lines with newline characters using `join(lines, \"\\n\")` and returns the wrapped string.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn the example, the `wrap_string` function is called with the `text` and a `text_width` of 15. It wraps the string at word boundaries whenever the line length exceeds 15 characters, resulting in the wrapped output.","status":200,"tokens":[94,560],"elapsed":23.902075417,"cost":0.04341,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31877,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
