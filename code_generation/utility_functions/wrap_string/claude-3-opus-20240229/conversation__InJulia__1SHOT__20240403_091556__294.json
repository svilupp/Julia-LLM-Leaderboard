Here's a Julia function `wrap_string` that wraps a given string based on a maximum `text_width` and adds a new line whenever the width would be exceeded:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= (isempty(current_line) ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters: `text` (the input string to be wrapped) and `text_width` (the maximum width before wrapping, defaulting to 10).\n\n2. It splits the `text` into individual words using the `split` function.\n\n3. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and an empty string `current_line` to store the current line being built.\n\n4. It iterates over each word in the `words` array:\n   - If adding the current word to the `current_line` would not exceed the `text_width`, it appends the word to the `current_line` with a space separator (if `current_line` is not empty).\n   - If adding the current word would exceed the `text_width`, it pushes the `current_line` to the `lines` array and starts a new line with the current word.\n\n5. After iterating over all the words, if there is any remaining content in `current_line`, it is pushed to the `lines` array.\n\n6. Finally, it joins the lines in the `lines` array with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) and returns the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function is called with the input string `\"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"` and a `text_width` of 15. It wraps the string accordingly, adding new lines whenever the width would be exceeded, and returns the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[57,617],"elapsed":22.542147417,"cost":0.04713,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15090,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
