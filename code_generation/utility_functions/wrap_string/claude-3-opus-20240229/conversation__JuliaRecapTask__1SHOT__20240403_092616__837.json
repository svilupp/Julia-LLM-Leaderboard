[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `wrap_string` function in Julia that wraps text based on a specified maximum text width:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= isempty(current_line) ? word : \" $word\"\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It takes a `text` argument of type `AbstractString` and an optional `text_width` argument of type `Int` with a default value of 10.\n\n2. The `split` function is used to split the `text` into individual words.\n\n3. Two variables are initialized: `lines` to store the wrapped lines and `current_line` to keep track of the current line being built.\n\n4. It iterates over each `word` in the `words` array.\n\n5. If the length of the `current_line` plus the length of the current `word` is less than or equal to `text_width`, the `word` is appended to the `current_line`. The `isempty` check is used to avoid adding an extra space at the beginning of a line.\n\n6. If the length exceeds `text_width`, the `current_line` is added to the `lines` array, and a new `current_line` is started with the current `word`.\n\n7. After the loop, any remaining `current_line` is added to the `lines` array.\n\n8. Finally, the `join` function is used to join the `lines` array with newline characters (`\"\\n\"`) to create the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long text that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\ntext that needs\nto be wrapped.\n```\n\nThe `wrap_string` function wraps the input text based on the specified `text_width` of 15 characters per line, adding line breaks where necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[344,572],"elapsed":25.186485417,"cost":0.04805999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19989,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
