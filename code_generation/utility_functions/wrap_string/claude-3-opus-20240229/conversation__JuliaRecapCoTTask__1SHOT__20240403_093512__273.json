[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Split the input `text` into individual words using `split`\n2. Initialize `lines` to store the wrapped lines, and `current_line` to build each line\n3. Iterate through each `word`:\n   - If adding the `word` to `current_line` doesn't exceed `text_width`, append it \n   - Otherwise, push `current_line` to `lines`, and reset `current_line` with the current `word`\n4. After the loop, push any remaining words in `current_line` to `lines`\n5. Join `lines` with newline characters `\\n` and return the result\n\nThe function uses `AbstractString` to accept any string type. It defaults `text_width` to 10 but allows overriding it.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[345,469],"elapsed":20.653167166,"cost":0.04035,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
