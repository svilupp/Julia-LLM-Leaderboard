It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia along with an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function takes a `text` parameter as a string and an optional `text_width` parameter with a default value of 10.\n2. It splits the `text` into individual words using `split(text)`.\n3. It initializes an empty array `lines` to store the wrapped lines and a `current_line` string to build each line.\n4. It iterates over each `word` in the `words` array.\n   - If the length of the `current_line` plus the length of the `word` is less than or equal to `text_width`, it appends the `word` to the `current_line` with a preceding space.\n   - Otherwise, it pushes the `current_line` (after removing leading/trailing spaces) to the `lines` array and starts a new `current_line` with the current `word`.\n5. After the loop, if there is any remaining content in `current_line`, it pushes it to the `lines` array.\n6. Finally, it joins the `lines` array with newline characters (`\\n`) and returns the wrapped string.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function is called with the `text` string and a `text_width` of 15. The function wraps the string by adding a new line whenever the maximum width of 15 characters would be exceeded. The resulting wrapped string is then printed.","status":200,"tokens":[94,552],"elapsed":22.66081625,"cost":0.04281,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1164,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
