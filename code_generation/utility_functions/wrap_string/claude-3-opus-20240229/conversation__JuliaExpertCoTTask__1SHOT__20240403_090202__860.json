It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Approach:\n   - Split the input string into words\n   - Iterate over the words and keep track of the current line width\n   - If adding the current word exceeds the maximum text width, start a new line\n   - Join the words with spaces and newline characters to form the wrapped string\n\n2. Functions and code:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_string::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_string)\n    wrapped_lines = String[]\n    current_line = String[]\n    current_width = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_width + word_length + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_lines, join(current_line, \" \"))\n            current_line = [word]\n            current_width = word_length\n        else\n            push!(current_line, word)\n            current_width += word_length + 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_lines, join(current_line, \" \"))\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Solving the task:\n\n```julia\ninput_string = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(input_string)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\n4. Checking the solution:\n\nThe solution splits the input string into words, iterates over the words, and keeps track of the current line width. If adding a word exceeds the maximum text width, it starts a new line. The words are joined with spaces and newline characters to form the wrapped string.\n\nThe example demonstrates that the function correctly wraps the input string into lines based on the specified text width of 10 characters.\n\nThe solution correctly solves the task of wrapping words into lines based on a maximum text width.","status":200,"tokens":[168,466],"elapsed":17.545972125,"cost":0.037469999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32470,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
