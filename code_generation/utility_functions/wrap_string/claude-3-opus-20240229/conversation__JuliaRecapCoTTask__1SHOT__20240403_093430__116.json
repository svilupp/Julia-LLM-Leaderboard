[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Split the input text into individual words \n2. Initialize an array to hold the output lines and a buffer for the current line\n3. Iterate through each word:\n   - If adding it to the current line stays within `text_width`, append it \n   - Otherwise, push the current line to the output array and start a new line with this word\n4. After the loop, push any remaining content as the final line\n5. Join the lines array with newline delimiters\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[345,425],"elapsed":22.153240042,"cost":0.03705,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4828,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
