It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Split the input string into words\n2. Initialize an empty string to store the result\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line width\n4. Iterate over the words\n   - If adding the current word to the line would exceed the maximum width, add a newline character and reset the current width\n   - Append the current word to the result string\n   - Update the current width by adding the length of the current word plus one (for the space)\n5. Return the resulting string\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_width = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_width + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_width = 0\n        end\n        \n        result *= word * \" \"\n        current_width += length(word) + 1\n    end\n    \n    return strip(result)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nwrapped = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function correctly wraps the words into lines, adding a newline character each time the maximum width of 10 characters would be exceeded.","status":200,"tokens":[168,336],"elapsed":14.091815,"cost":0.027719999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2628,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
