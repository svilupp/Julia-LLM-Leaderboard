Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia, along with an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= word * \" \"\n        else\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n    return rstrip(wrapped_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `wrap_string` function takes two arguments: `text`, which is the input string to be wrapped, and `text_width`, which is the maximum width of each line (default value is 10).\n\n2. The function starts by splitting the input `text` into individual words using the `split` function.\n\n3. It initializes two variables: `wrapped_text` to store the wrapped text and `current_line` to store the current line being constructed.\n\n4. The function iterates over each word in the `words` array.\n\n5. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`.\n   - If the combined length of `current_line` and the word is less than or equal to `text_width`, the word is appended to `current_line` along with a space.\n   - If the combined length exceeds `text_width`, the `current_line` is appended to `wrapped_text` followed by a newline character (`\\n`), and `current_line` is reset to the current word along with a space.\n\n6. After iterating over all the words, the remaining `current_line` is appended to `wrapped_text`.\n\n7. Finally, the function uses `rstrip` to remove any trailing whitespace from `wrapped_text` and returns the wrapped text.\n\nIn the example usage, we have a long string that needs to be wrapped. We call the `wrap_string` function with the text and a `text_width` of 15. The function wraps the text and returns the wrapped version, which is then printed.\n\nThe output shows the wrapped text, where each line is limited to a maximum width of 15 characters, and words are not split across lines.","status":200,"tokens":[57,618],"elapsed":22.592151583,"cost":0.047205,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31209,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
