It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here are the steps to approach this problem:\n\n1. Split the input string into words\n2. Initialize an empty result string\n3. Iterate through the words\n4. If adding the current word to the result string would exceed `text_width`, first add a newline character\n5. Add the current word to the result string\n6. Return the resulting wrapped string\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        result *= word * \" \"\n        line_length += length(word) + 1\n    end\n    \n    return rstrip(result)\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n1. `split(text)` splits the input string into words.\n2. We initialize an empty `result` string and `line_length` to keep track of the current line length.\n3. We iterate through each `word` in `words`.\n4. If adding the current `word` to the `result` would make `line_length` exceed `text_width`, we first append a newline character to `result` and reset `line_length` to 0.\n5. We append the current `word` and a space to `result` and update `line_length` accordingly.\n6. Finally, we use `rstrip` to remove any trailing whitespace from the `result` string and return it.\n\nThe example demonstrates using the `wrap_string` function with the provided text. The output shows the text wrapped into lines based on the default `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[168,476],"elapsed":17.398555208,"cost":0.03822,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21044,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
