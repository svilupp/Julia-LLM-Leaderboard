Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional named argument `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n   - Split the input string into words.\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the wrapped text.\n   - Iterate over the words and keep adding them to the current line until adding the next word would exceed the maximum text width.\n   - If adding the next word would exceed the text width, add a newline character to the wrapped text and start a new line with the current word.\n   - After iterating over all the words, add the remaining text to the wrapped text.\n\n2.
