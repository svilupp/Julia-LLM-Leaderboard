Here's how I would approach this problem:\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Split the input string into words.\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the current line.\n   - Iterate over the words and add them to the current line one by one, checking that the length of the current line does not exceed the maximum text width. If it does, add the current line to the output and start a new line.\n   - After all words have been processed, add the remaining words in the current line to the output.\n\n2. Write the function and other necessary code:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n   words = split(text, \" \")\n   lines = String[]\n   current_line = \"\"\n   for word in words\n       if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n           push!(lines, current_line)\n           current_line","status":200,"tokens":[164,200],"elapsed":3.390322958,"cost":0.0005824,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-630703385,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
