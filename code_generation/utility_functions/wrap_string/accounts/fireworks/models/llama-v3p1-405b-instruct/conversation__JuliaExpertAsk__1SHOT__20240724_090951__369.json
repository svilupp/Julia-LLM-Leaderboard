It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple function that does what you requested using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        if line_length + word_length + 1 > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        if line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        result *= word\n        line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\ntext = \"This is a test with a multiple line\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 10))\n```\n\nThe function works by splitting a string into words, iterating over words, and calculating the new line length with a word addition. If the new line length exceeds the `text_width`, it appends the new line symbol to result and nullifies `line_length`. Finally, it appends a word to the result and appends a word length to `line_length`.","status":200,"tokens":[96,240],"elapsed":8.21961075,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-873488383,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
