The function must iterate over words in the string and start a new line whenever adding the next word would exceed `text_width`.\n\n## Step 2: Write the function\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_width = 0\n    \n    for word in split(str)\n        # Check if adding the word would exceed text_width\n        if line_width + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_width = 0\n        end\n        \n        # Add the word to the current line\n        if line_width > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_width += 1\n        end\n        result *= word\n        line_width += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    result\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task and provide an example\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThe final answer is: there is no numerical answer for this task, as it's about providing a function.","status":200,"tokens":[165,265],"elapsed":9.219778417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":620863755,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
