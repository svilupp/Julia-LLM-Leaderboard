If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new line with the current word. If the current word itself is longer than `text_width`, it splits the word over multiple lines. Finally, it joins the result lines together with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.\n\nNote that this function doesn't handle punctuation attached to words (e.g. \"word,\" or \"word.\") in a special way; it simply treats them as part of the word. It also doesn't attempt to split words in a way that preserves word roots or other linguistic features; it simply splits them when necessary to stay within the width limit.","status":200,"tokens":[61,418],"elapsed":13.986954542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-899636621,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
