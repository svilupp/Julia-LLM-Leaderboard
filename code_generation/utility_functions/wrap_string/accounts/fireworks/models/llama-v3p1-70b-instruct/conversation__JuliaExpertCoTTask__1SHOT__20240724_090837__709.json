Then, it iterates over each word and checks whether adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it would, the current line is added to the list of lines and a new line is started with the current word. Finally, all lines are joined together with newline characters and the result is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[165,240],"elapsed":11.568175625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":20867641,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
