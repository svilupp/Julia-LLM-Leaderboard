Each time it tries to add a word to the current line and this line would be longer than `text_width`, it starts a new line. The function returns the text wrapped according to this rule as a string with newline characters between the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[96,345],"elapsed":1.627372875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1822489839,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
