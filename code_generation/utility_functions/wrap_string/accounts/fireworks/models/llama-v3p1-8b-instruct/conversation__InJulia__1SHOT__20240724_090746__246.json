Make sure the words are wrapped correctly.\"))\n```\n\nIn this code, `split(text)` is used to split the input text into words. Then, for each word, the code checks if adding that word to the current line would make the line too long. If it would, it starts a new line. After adding each word, the length of the current line is updated accordingly. Finally, the wrapped text is returned. The `println` at the end test the function with a given string.","status":200,"tokens":[61,241],"elapsed":0.898211042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-966182496,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
