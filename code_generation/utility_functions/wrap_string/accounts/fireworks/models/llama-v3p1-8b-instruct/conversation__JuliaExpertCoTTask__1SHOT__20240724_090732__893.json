If adding a new word to the current line would exceed the text width, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line. Finally, it adds the last line to the list and joins all lines with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[165,222],"elapsed":1.021897875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-962468420,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
