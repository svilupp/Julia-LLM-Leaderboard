[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"\nlines = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprintln(map(x->x*\"\\n\",lines))\n```\n\nThis code creates a new function `wrap_string`. The first part defines the signature for the function. It uses a high-level data type `AbstractString` to be flexible with inputs, and `text_width` as an optional argument with a default value of 10.\n\nThe function splits the input `text` into individual words and then iterates over them. When a word would exceed the `text_width\", the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started with the current word. If the current line would not exceed the text width after adding the current word, it is appended. \n\nThe `push!` function is used to add elements to the list `lines` without specifying the list as a whole, resulting in more memory-efficient code. As soon as all words are processed, the last line is added to the `lines` list.\n\nThe last part, before the function definition, uses a test input, and the `println(map(x->x*\"\\n\",lines))` statement prints the lines of the wrapped string, each with a trailing newline.","status":200,"tokens":[319,403],"elapsed":1.606190208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-985252033,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
