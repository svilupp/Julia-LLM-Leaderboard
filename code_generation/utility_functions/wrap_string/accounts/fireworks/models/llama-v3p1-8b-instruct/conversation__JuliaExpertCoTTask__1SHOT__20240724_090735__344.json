Then, we iterate over the words and check if adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, we add the current line to the list of wrapped lines and start a new line with the current word. If it wouldn't, we simply add the word to the current line. Finally, we return the wrapped lines joined with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[165,243],"elapsed":1.03759075,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-666055252,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
