If the current word when added to the current line word would extend a line beyond `text_width`, the current line is added to `result` and a new line is started with the word.  This prevents words that are longer than `text_width` from continuing over multiple lines.","status":200,"tokens":[165,237],"elapsed":1.027522334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-68016014,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
