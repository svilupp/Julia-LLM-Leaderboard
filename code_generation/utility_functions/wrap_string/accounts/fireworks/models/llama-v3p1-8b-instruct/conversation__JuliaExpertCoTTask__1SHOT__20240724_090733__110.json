It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that implements the `wrap_string` functionality as per the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    result = \"\"\n    words = split(text)\n    current_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_length + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_length = 0\n        end\n        result *= word * \" \"\n        current_length += length(word) + 1\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the text only contains spaces as separators between words. It splits the input string into words and then iterates over each word, checking when the current line length exceeds the maximum text width. It adds a new line at such points and resets the current line length, finally returning the wrapped string.","status":200,"tokens":[165,200],"elapsed":0.969774375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1010864779,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
