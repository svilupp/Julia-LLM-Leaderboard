If adding a word to the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the result.\n\nYou can also specify a custom `text_width` by passing it as a keyword argument:\n```julia\njulia> println(wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped to a width of 20 characters.\", text_width=20))\nThis is a very long\nstring that needs to be\nwrapped to a width of 20\ncharacters.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[62,340],"elapsed":2.016764125,"cost":0.00030517999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1239925590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
