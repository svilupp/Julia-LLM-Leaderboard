X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It uses a relatively straightforward algorithm to wrap the input string into lines not exceeding `text_width`. By comparing the sum up to a maximum character count (plus additional variables like total storage from previous data), we check for sufficient space within a `text_width` limit. Word splitting ensures words aren’t divided at the end of `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[322,2295],"elapsed":12.743939125,"cost":0.00200303,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1463470686,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
