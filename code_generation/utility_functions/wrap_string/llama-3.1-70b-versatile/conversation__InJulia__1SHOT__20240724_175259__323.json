If adding a word to the current line would exceed the `text_width` (which defaults to 10), it adds the current line to the result and starts a new line with the current word. Finally, it adds the last line to the result and returns it.\n\nYou can also specify a custom `text_width` when calling the function:\n```julia\njulia> println(wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped\", text_width=20))\nThis is a very long\nstring that needs to be\nwrapped\n```","status":200,"tokens":[62,312],"elapsed":4.913202584,"cost":0.00028305999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":646180327,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
