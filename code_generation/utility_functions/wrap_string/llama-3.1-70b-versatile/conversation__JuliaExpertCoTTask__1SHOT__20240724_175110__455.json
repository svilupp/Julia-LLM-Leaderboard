Split the input text into words.\n2. Initialize an empty array to store the lines and an empty string to build the current line.\n3. Iterate over each word. If adding the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, start a new line.\n4. Otherwise, append the word to the current line.\n5. After iterating over all words, add the last line to the array of lines.\n6. Join the lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\n**Output**\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[166,261],"elapsed":1.367030833,"cost":0.00030412999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1420227488,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
