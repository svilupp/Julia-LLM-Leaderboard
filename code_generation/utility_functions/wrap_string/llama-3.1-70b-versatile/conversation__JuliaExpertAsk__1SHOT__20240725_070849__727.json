If adding a word to the current line would exceed the maximum width, it adds the current line to the result and starts a new line with the current word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. Finally, it adds the last line to the result.","status":200,"tokens":[97,209],"elapsed":1.586550292,"cost":0.00022234,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-307297210,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
