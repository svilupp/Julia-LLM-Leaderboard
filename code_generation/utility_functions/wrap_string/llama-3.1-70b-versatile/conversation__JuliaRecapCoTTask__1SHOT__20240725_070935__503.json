[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, we append the current line to the result and start a new line with the current word. If it wouldn't, we add the word to the current line.\n*   After iterating over all words, we append the last line to the result.\n*   Finally, we return the wrapped string.\n\nIn the example usage, we call the `wrap_string` function with a long string and print the result. The output will be a wrapped string with each line at most `text_width` characters long.","status":200,"tokens":[322,363],"elapsed":1.876366042,"cost":0.00047674999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1215148642,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
