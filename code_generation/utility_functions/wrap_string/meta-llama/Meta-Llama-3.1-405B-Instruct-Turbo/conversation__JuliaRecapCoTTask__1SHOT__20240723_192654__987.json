[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We'll need to keep track of the current line length and add a newline character when the maximum text width is exceeded.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the Task\nHere's a possible implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped\"))\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nThis is a\nvery long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[321,421],"elapsed":6.699633,"cost":0.00792,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1915467039,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
