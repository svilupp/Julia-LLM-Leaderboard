[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Then, we iterate over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, we start a new line. We keep track of the current line length and update it as we add words to the result string. Finally, we return the result string with trailing whitespace removed.\n\nThe example shows how to use the `wrap_string` function with a sample input string. The output will be a string with newlines inserted to wrap the text at the specified `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[320,252],"elapsed":3.443180625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1086365374,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
