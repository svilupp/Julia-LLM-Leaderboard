[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If adding a word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[166,165],"elapsed":2.198843042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1224223285,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
