[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This function `wrap_string` splits the input string into words, then iterates over those words, adding each one to the current line until the line's length would exceed `text_width`. At that point, it starts a new line.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        elseif line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_length += 1\n        end\n\n        result *= word\n        line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n# Example\n\n```julia\njulia> println(wrap_string(\"This is an example string.\", 10))\nThis is an\nexample\nstring.\n```\n\n# Verification\nThe function worked correctly because it correctly wrapped the string at the desired line width, and preserved the original order of words.","status":200,"tokens":[364,283],"elapsed":2.386799125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1065036251,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
