Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Here's a simple implementation of a `wrap_string` function in Julia that does what you're asking for. This function takes a string and a maximum width as arguments, and it returns a new string where each line doesn't exceed the maximum width.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line = current_line * \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(lines, current_line)  # add the last line\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> text = \"This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.\"\n\"This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.\"\n\njulia> wrap_string(text, 10)\n\"This is a\\ntest of the\\nemergency\\nbroadcast\\nsystem.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,323],"elapsed":2.244878791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":345664094,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
