[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input string into words and iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would not exceed the text width, it adds the word to the current line. If adding the current word would exceed the text width, it adds the current line to the wrapped string, starts a new line with the current word, and continues iterating over the remaining words. After iterating over all words, it adds the last line to the wrapped string and returns the wrapped string.\n\nThe example string \"This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\" is wrapped to a text width of 10 and printed. The output would be:\n\n```\nThis is a\nvery long\nsentence\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[366,392],"elapsed":2.832533375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":722119880,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
