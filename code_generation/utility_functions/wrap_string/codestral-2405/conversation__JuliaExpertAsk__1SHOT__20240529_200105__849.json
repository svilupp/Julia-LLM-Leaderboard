This is only a test.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a test\nof the emergency\nbroadcast system.\nThis is only a test.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,265],"elapsed":1.872083792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1046421842,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
