Once the maximum text width is reached, the current line is added to the list of lines, and a new line is started with the current word. After all words have been processed, any remaining text in the current line is added to the list of lines. Finally, the list of lines is joined together with newline characters to produce the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[98,300],"elapsed":2.098075958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-727812056,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
