It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia that does what you're asking for.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line = current_line == \"\" ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> text = \"This is a sample text for the wrapping test.\"\n\"This is a sample text for the wrapping test.\"\n\njulia> println(wrap_string(text, 10))\nThis is a\nsample text\nfor the\nwrapping\ntest.\n```\n\nThis function splits the input text into words, then iterates over each word. If adding the current word to the current line would not exceed the maximum text width, it adds the word to the line. If adding the word would exceed the maximum text width, it starts a new line with the current word. After iterating over all words, it joins the lines with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[98,344],"elapsed":2.424901125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":407118042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
