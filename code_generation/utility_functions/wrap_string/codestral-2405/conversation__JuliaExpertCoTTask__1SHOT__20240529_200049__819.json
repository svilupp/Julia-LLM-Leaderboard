It splits the string into words, and then iterates over these words. If adding a new word would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line. The function then builds up a new string with the words, each separated by a space, and with new lines as necessary. The function finally returns this new string. When run with the example string, this program will print:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis means that each line is no longer than 10 characters (not including the new line character).","status":200,"tokens":[179,298],"elapsed":2.098914167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2107209129,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
