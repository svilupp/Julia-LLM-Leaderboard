It will iterate over the words in the string and add a new line whenever the maximum width would be exceeded.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    wrapped_string = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            wrapped_string *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        elseif current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_string *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        wrapped_string *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_string\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill wrap\\nwords into\\nlines\"\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function has added new lines at appropriate places to ensure that the line length does not exceed the maximum width of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[179,316],"elapsed":2.227044459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1370343400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
