[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"From the task, the function `wrap_string` needs to take an input string, iterate over the words, and wrap them so that each line in the output string does not exceed a given width `text_width`. The default value for `text_width` will be 10 characters, but it can be adjusted to any integer value.\n\nThe wrapping should:\n- Place each word onto a new line if its addition would cause the current line to exceed `text_width`.\n- Include spaces between words, but ensure they are not added at the start or end of lines, nor should a line start with a space.\n- Properly handle strings with multiple spaces.\n\nWe'll build the function with these considerations using Julia's string handling capabilities.\n\n## Julia Snippets that Will be Useful\n- String manipulation: `\"hello\"[1:4]` for slicing, `join()`, `split()` to split the string by whitespace.\n- Arrays and their handling: loop through arrays with `for`.\n- Conditional operations: `if`, `elseif`, `else`.\n\n## Implementation Steps:\n1. Split the string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty result array to store line strings.\n3. Iterate over the words and attempt to append them to the current line. If adding a word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, start a new line.\n4. Join all lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the text into words\n    words = split(text)\n    # Initialize the result as an empty array of lines\n    lines = []\n    # Initialize the current line and its length\n    current_line = \"\"\n    current_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Calculate new length if word is added with a space if not the first word\n        new_length = current_length + length(word) + (current_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)\n        \n        # If adding the word would exceed the max width, start a new line\n        if new_length > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)  # Add the current line to the lines\n            current_line = word   # Start the new line with the current word\n            current_length = length(word)  # Reset the current line length to the new word length\n        else\n            # Append word to the current line with space if it's not empty\n            current_line = current_length > 0 ? current_line * \" \" * word : word\n            current_length = new_length\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Don't forget to add the last processed line if it isn't empty\n    if current_length > 0\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    # Join all lines with newline characters\n    joined_lines = join(lines, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_lines\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Julia is fun and we love coding with Julia\", text_width=10))\n```\n\nThis function parses the string into lines based on the `text_width` limit, and it should refit words to ensure the width does not exceed what is defined by `text_width`. Each word is examined and added to lines appropriately, ensuring at the end to capture all properly wrapped lines.","status":200,"tokens":[317,681],"elapsed":19.03088775,"cost":0.0236,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1545231767,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
