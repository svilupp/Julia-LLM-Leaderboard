The default width is set to 10 characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If adding the new word exceeds the limit, finish the current line\n            result = result * current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # If not, add the word to the current line\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the final line to the result\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        result = result * current_line\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nHere is an example demonstrating how you could use the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis will display output with lines wrapped such that each contains no more than 10 characters, respecting word boundaries. You can modify `text_width` to change the maximum line length according to your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[93,319],"elapsed":8.141583958,"cost":0.0105,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1168370083,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
