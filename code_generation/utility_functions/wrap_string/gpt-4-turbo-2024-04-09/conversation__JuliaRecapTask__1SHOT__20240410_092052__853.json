[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Split the input string into words using the `split` function.\n2. Use a loop to iterate through these words, adding them one by one to a result string.\n3. For each word, check whether adding it (plus a space for separation from the previous word) would exceed the `text_width`. \n4. If adding the word would exceed the width, insert a newline character before adding the word to the result string.\n5. Maintain a counter to keep track of the current line length. \n\nEdge cases to be considered:\n- Single word longer than `text_width`.\n- Empty input string.\n- String without spaces.\n\n# Implementation:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) + (line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        if line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        result *= word\n        line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\ntext = \"Julia is high-performance, high-level, dynamic programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n```\n\nThis function starts with splitting the string into words, then processes each word individually, inserting it into the result string. Care is taken to include a space between words as required and to start a new line where necessary.\n\n# Double-checking the Solution\n\n- If the example or edge cases run as expected, then the problem-solving approach seems correct. If desired, you could run additional checks and test cases directly.","status":200,"tokens":[317,491],"elapsed":14.752564334,"cost":0.0179,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":951920438,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
