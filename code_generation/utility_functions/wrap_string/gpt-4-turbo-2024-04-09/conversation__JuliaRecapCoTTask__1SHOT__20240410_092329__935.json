[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem of wrapping text based on a width limit, we can use a straightforward approach:\n1. Split the provided text into words.\n2. Iterate through each word and append it to a string that accumulates the current line.\n3. If adding the next word would exceed the maximum width, a newline is added to the accumulator and we start the new line with the current word.\n4. Continue this process until all words are processed.\n5. Finally, return the resultant string which contains the wrapped text.\n\nHere's a function written in Julia that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split text into an array of words\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word plus a space exceeds the width\n        if current_line_length + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"   # Start a new line\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n\n        if current_line_length > 0  # if not the beginning of a line, prepend a space before word\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We check whether adding the next word (including a space to separate words) will exceed the maximum line width.\n- If it does, we append a newline character to the `wrapped_text` and reset the `current_line_length`.\n- Otherwise, we add a space (if it's not the start of a new line) and concatenate the word to `wrapped_text`.\n- This will handle words and maintain the maximum width limit as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[318,413],"elapsed":12.754483083,"cost":0.01557,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1076063417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
