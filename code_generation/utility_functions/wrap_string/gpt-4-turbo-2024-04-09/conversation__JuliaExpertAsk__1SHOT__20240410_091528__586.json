The default width is set to 10.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            result = result * current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = current_line * \" \" * word\n            else\n                current_line = word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    result = result * current_line\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"This is a simple example to demonstrate wrapping of text.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text))\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input text into words. It then iterates over each word, adding it to `current_line` if adding the next word does not exceed `text_width`. If it does exceed, the `current_line` is added to the `result` with a newline, and `current_line` is reset with the current word. After the loop ends, any remaining text in `current_line` is added to `result`. The function finally returns the `result`.\n\nThe sample text `\"This is a simple example to demonstrate wrapping of text.\"` when wrapped using the default width of 10, will have words moved to a new line as they exceed the limit of 10 characters per line.","status":200,"tokens":[93,345],"elapsed":9.869121041,"cost":0.01128,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":745237006,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
