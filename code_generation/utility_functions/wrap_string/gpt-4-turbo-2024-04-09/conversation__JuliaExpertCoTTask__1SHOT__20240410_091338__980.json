For each word:\n     - Check if adding the current word to the line exceeds the `text_width`. If the `current_width` (without the word) plus the length of the current word and space (if itâ€™s not the first word) exceeds `text_width`, then:\n       - Append a newline character to `output` if `output` isn't empty (to not start with a newline in case the first word itself is too long).\n       - Reset `current_width` to the length of the new word.\n     - Else:\n       - Append the word, prefixed with a space if it's not the first word on the current or a fresh line.\n       - Update `current_width` accordingly.\n   - Return the `output` string which now contains the words wrapped according to the `text_width`.\n\n2. **Write the function**:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(input_text)\n    output = \"\"\n    current_width = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_width == 0 || current_width + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            output *= (current_width == 0 ? word : \" $word\")\n            current_width += (current_width == 0 ? length(word) : length(word) + 1)\n        else\n            output *= (output == \"\" ? word : \"\\n$word\")\n            current_width = length(word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\n3. **Example**:\n   - Use the function `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")`. According to the logic detailed above, the words will be wrapped to ensure no line exceeds 10 characters unless a single word itself is longer.\n\n4. **Run the example**:\n```julia\nexample_output = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(example_output)\n```\n**Expected Output**:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n    - Explanation: Each line does not exceed 10 characters, thus following the width constraint correctly. For instance, \"will wrap\" is 9 characters long, just under the limit.\n\nThis solution should indeed provide correct outputs based on the example. It adaptively forms lines based on the given `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[162,563],"elapsed":13.551165542,"cost":0.01851,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1781055642,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
