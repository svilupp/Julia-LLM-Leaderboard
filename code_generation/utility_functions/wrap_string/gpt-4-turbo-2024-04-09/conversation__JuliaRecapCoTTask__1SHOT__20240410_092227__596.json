[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we need to write a function `wrap_string` that wraps a given string based on a maximum column width (i.e., `text_width`). Essentially, this function will ensure that no line in the resulting string will be longer than `text_width` characters. If adding a new word would exceed this limit, the function should insert a newline character (`\\n`) before the word. \n\nFollowing an efficient and clear approach based on Julia coding standards:\n1. We will use a loop to iterate over words in the input string.\n2. We will use a counter to keep track of the current line length and decide when to insert a newline.\n3. We will handle edge cases like very long words that exceed the text width by themselves.\n\nI'll implement this approach in the function and provide an example for test purposes.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)\n    if isempty(words)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Initialize the result with the first word and setup the current line length\n    result = words[1]\n    current_length = length(words[1])\n    \n    # Process the remaining words\n    for word in words[2:end]\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding this word would surpass the text width\n        if current_length + 1 + word_length > text_width\n            result = result * \"\\n\" * word\n            current_length = word_length\n        else\n            result = result * \" \" * word\n            current_length += 1 + word_length  # Adding 1 for the space before the word\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\ntext = \"This is a demonstration of the wrapping function.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n\n```\n\nThis code defined in Julia ensures proper wrapping and handles edge cases like empty inputs. The example given will show how the function wraps text to a specified width of 15 characters per line. By splitting the input string and managing line lengths, we prevent any line from exceeding the desired width, adding necessary line breaks.","status":200,"tokens":[318,442],"elapsed":10.496866333,"cost":0.01644,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1552614164,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
