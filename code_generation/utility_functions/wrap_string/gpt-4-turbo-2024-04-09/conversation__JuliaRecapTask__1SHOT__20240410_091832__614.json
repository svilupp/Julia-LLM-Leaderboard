[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function will construct new lines as needed to avoid exceeding the specified maximum width.\n\n## Recall Julia Snippets \n\nFor this task, the `split` function can be used to break the string into words, and a loop can be utilized to check the combined length of words against the given width:\n\n- `split(str)` to get words from the string.\n- String concatenation using `*`\n- Conditionals (`if`) to check whether adding a next word will exceed the width.\n\n## Solve the Task\nTo achieve the task, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the given string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty result string and a current line.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n   - Check if adding the current word plus a space exceeds the maximum `text_width`.\n   - If it does not exceed, append it to the current line.\n   - If it exceeds, append the current line to the result and reset the current line.\n4. After the loop, ensure the last line is added to the result.\n\n## Code\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the width\n        if length(line) + length(word) + (line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            # Append the current line to result and start a new line\n            result *= (result == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * line\n            line = word\n        else\n            # Add word to the current line (with space if line isn't empty)\n            line *= (line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Append the last processed line if not empty\n    if line != \"\"\n        result *= (result == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * line\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 20))\n```\n\nIn this example, I set the maximum `text_width` to 20 for better visualization through multiple lengths of words, but by default, the function maintains a maximum width of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[317,507],"elapsed":15.40498,"cost":0.01838,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-171965706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
