[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Split the input text string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty string that will accumulate words while keeping track of the current line's length.\n3. For each word in the text:\n   - If adding this word would exceed the maximum `text_width`, append the current accumulated line to the output and start a new line.\n   - Otherwise, add the word to the current line.\n4. Make sure to add the last processed line to the output if it's not empty.\n5. Return the result as a multiline string.\n\nThe function will be straightforward and will not require any special Julia libraries.\n\nLet's implement this function now:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    result = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    current_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding this word plus a space exceeds limit\n        if current_length + word_length + (current_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # Add current line to result and reset\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n            current_length = word_length\n        else\n            # Append to the current line\n            if current_length > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n            current_length += word_length + (current_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if current_length > 0\n        push!(result, current_line) # Add the last line if it exists\n    end\n    \n    join(result, \"\\n\") # Join all lines into a single string with newlines\nend\n\n# Example\nexample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text))\n\n# Should produce output where each line is <= 10 characters\n```\n\nThis function will efficiently handle the word wrapping by ensuring every line stays within the specified width limit, unless a single word itself exceeds this limit, in which case that word alone would form a line.","status":200,"tokens":[317,470],"elapsed":19.011290792,"cost":0.01727,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1044565361,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
