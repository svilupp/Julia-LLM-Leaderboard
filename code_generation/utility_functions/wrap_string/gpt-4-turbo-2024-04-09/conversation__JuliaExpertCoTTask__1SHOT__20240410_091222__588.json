Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we will develop the function `wrap_string` which takes a string and wraps the text such that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Input and Initialization**: Receive a string as input and set the default `text_width` to 10.\n2. **Iterate Words**: Split the string into words and iterate through them.\n3. **Word Addition Logic**: For each word, check if adding it to the current line exceeds the `text_width`. If it does, append the current line to the result and start a new line with the current word.\n4. **Output Formation**: After processing all words, make sure the last line is also appended to the result.\n5. **Return the Result**: Combine all lines into a single string with newline characters.\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on this logic.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    result = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the word plus space exceeds width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word  # Start new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Add word to the current line, prepend space if not empty\n            current_line *= (length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Do not forget to add the last line\n    push!(result, current_line)\n    \n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nexample_str = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_str))\n```\n\nThis example will print the string wrapped to a maximum width of 10 characters per line as per the conditions set. Each breaking point is decided by the overall length of accumulated characters in a line including new words that are considered to be appended.","status":200,"tokens":[162,432],"elapsed":10.345645625,"cost":0.014580000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2182479,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
