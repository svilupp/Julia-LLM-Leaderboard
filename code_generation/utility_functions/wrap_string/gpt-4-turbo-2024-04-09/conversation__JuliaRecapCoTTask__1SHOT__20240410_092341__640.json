[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the Julia function `wrap_string` which takes in a `text` string and an optional `text_width` parameter. The function intelligently inserts newline characters to ensure that each line does not exceed the given width based on word boundaries. If a word itself exceeds the provided `text_width`, it will unavoidably exceed the width limit on a new line by itself. \n\nLet's write the function according to the specifications and thereafter illustrate its functionality with an example.\n\n### Julia Function Definition\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the max length\n        if line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Start a new line if adding the word would exceed max length\n            wrapped_text *= (wrapped_text == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * word\n            line_length = word_length\n        else\n            # Add space before the word if it's not at the start of a line\n            wrapped_text *= (line_length == 0 ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n            line_length += (line_length == 0 ? word_length : word_length + 1)  # +1 for the space if not first in line\n        end\n    end\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```julia\ntext_example = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text_example, 20)  # Use a 20-character width for better visualization\n\nprintln(\"Original Text:\\n\", text_example)\nprintln(\"\\nWrapped Text:\\n\", wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- This function handles typical English text and respects word boundaries, ensuring words are not broken mid-point.\n- New lines are begun specifically when adding another word would surpass the `text_width` limit.\n- Efficient manipulation using string operations in Julia ensures performance.","status":200,"tokens":[318,435],"elapsed":11.903173791,"cost":0.01623,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-353971863,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
