It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly, we can create a function in Julia named `wrap_string` that iterates over the words in a given string. The function will introduce a new line (`'\\n'`) wherever the addition of the next word would cause the line to exceed a specified maximum width (`text_width`). By default, this width will be set to 10 characters.\n\nHere's how you could write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)  # Split the input string into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    output = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the text_width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0) > text_width\n            output *= current_line * \"\\n\"  # Add the current line to output and insert a newline\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Add a space before the word if it's not the beginning of a line\n            current_line *= (length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add any remaining text in current_line to output (to handle last line)\n    output *= current_line\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input and Splitting**: The function begins by taking a string `s` and an optional `text_width` parameter, splitting `s` into words.\n2. **Output Construction**: It iterates over these words, deciding for each whether appending the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n3. **Line Length Checking**: If adding another word would make the line too long, the current line is added to the output and a new line is started with the current word. Otherwise, the word is added to the current line.\n4. **Concatenation**: When adding a word to the current line, a space is included if it's not the start of a line.\n5. **Final Line**: Any text left in `current_line` after the loop is also added to the output to include the last line.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\ntest_string = \"This is a test string designed to demonstrate the function's capability to wrap text correctly.\"\n\n# Call the function with default text_width\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(test_string)\n\n# You can also specify a different width\nwrapped_text_15 = wrap_string(test_string, 15)\n\nprintln(wrapped_text)\nprintln(\"\\nWrapped with 15 characters width:\\n\", wrapped_text_15)\n```\n\nThis function splits the words considering spaces and preserves the integrity of each word without breaking any word across lines. Adjust `text_width` as necessary to see the changes in how text is wrapped.","status":200,"tokens":[58,591],"elapsed":17.304027125,"cost":0.01831,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-942081053,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
