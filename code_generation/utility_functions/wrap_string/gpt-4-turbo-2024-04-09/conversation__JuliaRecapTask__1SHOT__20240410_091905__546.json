[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

When this happens, start a new line (add a newline character).\n3. **Return**: The processed string with appropriate newlines.\n\n**Considerations**:\n- If a word itself is longer than `text_width`, it will necessarily cause the line to exceed the width limit. Therefore, a word should not be split and will appear on a new line.\n\n**Example**: A string `\"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\"` with `text_width = 10` would look like:\n\n    Julia is a \n    high-level, \n    high-performance \n    programming \n    language.\n\nNow, let's implement the `wrap_string` function following the described plan.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)  # Splits the text into words\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # Check if this word can fit in the current line\n        if current_line_length + word_length <= text_width\n            # if not the first word in the line, add a space\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                result *= \" \" * word\n                current_line_length += word_length + 1\n            else\n                result *= word\n                current_line_length += word_length\n            end\n        else\n            # Start a new line with this word\n            if length(result) > 0\n                result *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            result *= word\n            current_line_length = word_length\n        end\n    end\n   \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, the decomposition and logic within `wrap_string` ensure each line does not exceed the specified width by appropriately breaking at word boundaries while handling edge cases for word length versus line width constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[317,518],"elapsed":12.966981125,"cost":0.01871,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1156329914,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
