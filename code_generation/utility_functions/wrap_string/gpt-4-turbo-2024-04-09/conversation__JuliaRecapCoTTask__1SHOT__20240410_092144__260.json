[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

The function will handle splitting the string into words and reconstructing it with line breaks. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets\n1. String splitting can be done using the `split` function.\n2. Joining parts of a string or an array can be managed with the `join` function.\n3. Length of a string can be found using the `length` function.\n4. Conditional statement constructions (`if`, `else`) are used to decide if a new word causes the line length to exceed `text_width`.\n\n### Methodology\n- Use a loop to iterate through each word in the initial string.\n- Maintain a current line that accumulates words.\n- Check after appending each word whether the line would surpass the given `text_width`:\n    - If it would, append the current contents (minus the last word) to the output with a newline character, and reset the current line to start with the last word.\n    - If not, continue to add words to the current line.\n- At the end of iterations, add the remaining content of the current line to the output.\n\n### Example\nAfter implementation, the function can be demonstrated using an input example:\n- Input string: `\"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\"`\n- `text_width`: `20`\n\nThis example will illustrate how the function effectively wraps the text into the specified width.\n\n### Julia Implementation\nBelow is the code for the function `wrap_string` which fulfills the outlined plan:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    output = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            output *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        output *= current_line\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 20))\n```\n\nThis code will output the text wrapped such that each line does not exceed the provided text width of 20 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[318,542],"elapsed":14.599412292,"cost":0.01944,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1330103174,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
