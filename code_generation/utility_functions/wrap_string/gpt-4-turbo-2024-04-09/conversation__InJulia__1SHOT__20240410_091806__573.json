It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem in Julia, we need to create a function named `wrap_string` that takes a string as input along with an optional parameter for the text width (`text_width`). The function should iterate over the words in the input string and concatenate them in such a way that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`. When a word would exceed the limit if added to the current line, this word should start on a new line.\n\nHere is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the new word exceeds the width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width  # +1 for the space\n            result *= (current_line * \"\\n\")\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last processed line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is an example of how your function will work with different lengths of words.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text))\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It splits the input text into words.\n2. It iterates through each word and checks whether adding this word (plus a space if it's not the first word) to the current line would exceed the `text_width`.\n3. If adding the word would exceed the limit, the current line is added to the result with a newline character and the current word starts a new line.\n4. If the word doesn't exceed the limit, it's either added to the current line directly or it starts a new line if the `current_line` is initially empty.\n5. Finally, after the loop, there might still be content in `current_line` which needs to be added to the result.\n\nThis function keeps track of lines and ensures that no line exceeds the specified width while minimizing the number of lines used. Note that if a single word is longer than `text_width`, it will still be placed on its own line, possibly exceeding the width limit.","status":200,"tokens":[58,494],"elapsed":13.077641542,"cost":0.0154,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-739929667,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
