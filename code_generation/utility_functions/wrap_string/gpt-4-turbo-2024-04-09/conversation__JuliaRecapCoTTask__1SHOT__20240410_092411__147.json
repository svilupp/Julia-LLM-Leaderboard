[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function will output the string with inserted newline characters such that each line does not exceed the specified width based on word boundaries.\n\nHere's the systematic approach for our solution:\n\n1. **Recall Julia Snippets:** We need to break strings into words (`split` function), iterate through words (`for` loop), and conditionally concatenate strings based on cumulated length (conditionals `if-elseif-else`).\n\n2. **Solve the Task:**\n   - Split the input string into words.\n   - Initialize an output string and a tracker for the current line length.\n   - For each word:\n     - Check if adding the word plus a space would exceed the specified width.\n     - If not, append the word to the current line.\n     - If it would, append a newline (unless it's the start of text) and start a new line with the current word.\n   - Handle case sensitivity by keeping the function general since no specific requirements were mentioned.\n\n3. **Double-check for Correctness:**\n   - Verify that the function handles edge cases like:\n     - An empty string input.\n     - A string where one word is longer than the maximum length.\n     - Very long strings with multiple spaces.\n\nHere is the function implementation followed by an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    if isempty(words)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # Add the current line to the result and start a new line\n            if length(result) > 0\n                result *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            result *= current_line\n            current_line = word  # Start new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Add to the current line\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"  # Add a space before the next word\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Append any remaining words in the current line\n    if length(result) > 0 && length(current_line) > 0\n        result *= \"\\n\"\n    end\n    result *= current_line\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"Julia is wonderful for high performance computing tasks\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text))  # With default `text_width` of 10\n```\n\nThis example should demonstrate how the function splits a sentence into lines, ensuring each line does not surpass the default `text_width` of 10 characters, based on the spaces between words.","status":200,"tokens":[318,603],"elapsed":29.79622325,"cost":0.02127,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-267966392,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
