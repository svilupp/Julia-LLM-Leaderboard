It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Think through the approach**:\n   - Start iterating over each word in the string.\n   - Keep track of the current line's length.\n   - If adding the next word exceeds `text_width`:\n     - Add a newline before the word.\n     - Reset the current line's length.\n   - If it doesn't exceed, just add the word to the line.\n   - After iterating through all words, combine them into a final output string.\n\n2. **Write the function** `wrap_string`:\n   - The function will take a sentence string and optionally a `text_width` parameter.\n   - It splits the string on spaces to iterate over each word.\n   - Logic to check accumulative length and append words appropriately.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - Implement the logic inside the function.\n\n4. **Correctness check**:\n   - Test the function with the provided example and ensure that it is properly wrapping the text as per the specified width.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_length = 0\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_length + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(result, '\\n')\n            current_length = 0  # Reset current line's length\n        elseif current_length != 0\n            push!(result, ' ')\n            current_length += 1  # Account for the space\n        end\n        push!(result, word)\n        current_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return join(result)\nend\n\n# Example\nprint(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis implementation first checks if the current line length plus the next word exceeds the allowed width. If so, it inserts a newline character and starts a new line. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line, keeping track of length with spaces considered.","status":200,"tokens":[162,407],"elapsed":9.681924625,"cost":0.01383,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1607316702,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
