This function considers spaces and ensures that words are not broken up incorrectly across lines.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding this word will exceed the line length\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"  # Start a new line\n            wrapped_text *= word  # Place the word at the beginning of the new line\n            current_line_length = word_length  # Reset line length to the current word's length\n        else\n            # Check if we need to prepend a space before adding a word on the same line\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                wrapped_text *= \" \"  # Add a space before the word\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length += word_length\n        end\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nOutput of the `wrap_string` function when using the default `text_width` of 10 would look something like:\n\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-level,\nhigh-performance,\ndynamic\nprogramming\nlanguage.\n```\n\nThis output shows the words wrapped without exceeding the line width of 10 characters wherever possible. The example indicates the capability to deal with longer words and wrap them gracefully into the next line.","status":200,"tokens":[58,389],"elapsed":9.906911083,"cost":0.01225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-390092975,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
