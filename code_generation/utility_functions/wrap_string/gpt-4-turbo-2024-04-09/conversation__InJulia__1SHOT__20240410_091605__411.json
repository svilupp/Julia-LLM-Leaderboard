Below is a function in Julia that achieves your requirement to wrap strings based on a specified maximum text width. This function, `wrap_string`, splits the input text into words, iterates through these words, and constructs lines such that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the maximum text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # Add the current line to result and reset the current line\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # Add a space before the word if it's not the first word in the line\n            current_line *= (length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\") * word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the last line to the result\n    result *= current_line\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function accepts a string `text` and an optional parameter `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. `words = split(text)` splits the text into an array of words.\n3. `current_line` maintains the words for the current line being constructed.\n4. The function iterates through each word and decides whether to add it to the current line or start a new line based on the condition of exceeding `text_width`.\n5. If adding another word would exceed `text_width`, the current line is added to the result with a newline character, and `current_line` is reset.\n6. If the line doesn't need to be split, the word is added to `current_line`.\n7. After the loop, the final `current_line` is added to the result. \n\n### Example Usage:\nLet's see the function in action:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\nDepending on the word lengths and specified `text_width`, the output text will be wrapped accordingly. With a `text_width` of 15, words are added to each line ensuring that adding another word would not exceed the width limit. Consequently, lines may slightly differ in their actual character count, as wrapping strictly respects word boundaries. \n\nFeel free to modify the `text_width` parameter or the input text to see how the function behaves with different inputs!","status":200,"tokens":[58,558],"elapsed":17.618582375,"cost":0.017320000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1755137824,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
