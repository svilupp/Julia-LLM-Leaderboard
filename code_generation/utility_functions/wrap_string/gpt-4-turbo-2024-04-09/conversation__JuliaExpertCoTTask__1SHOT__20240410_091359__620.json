When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Approach\n\n1. Split the string into words.\n2. Iterate through each word and keep a track of the accumulated line length.\n3. If adding the next word exceeds the `text_width`, add the word to a new line, else append it to the current line.\n4. Concatenate the lines into the final string with each line separated by a newline character.\n\n## Step 2: Write the function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    final_text = \"\"\n    current_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_length + length(word) + (current_length == 0 ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            final_text = final_text * (final_text == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n            current_line = word\n            current_length = length(word)\n        else\n            current_line = current_line * (current_length == 0 ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n            current_length += length(word) + (current_length == 0 ? 0 : 1)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if current_line != \"\"\n        final_text = final_text * (final_text == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n    end\n    return final_text\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Example\n\nExecute the function using an example.\n\n```julia\nexample_output = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(example_output)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check the solution\n\nThe function is designed to keep checking the current line length and if adding another word will exceed the specified `text_width`, it will start a new line. This should correctly wrap the text into lines as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[162,395],"elapsed":11.37094,"cost":0.013470000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":45610488,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
