Split the input string into words.\n2. Initialize a current line that will record the words without exceeding the specified maximum text width.\n3. Iterate through each word:\n    - Calculate if adding the next word will exceed the `text_width`.\n    - If it exceeds, add the current line to the result and start a new line with the next word.\n    - If it doesn't exceed, append the word to the current line.\n4. Lastly, make sure to add any remaining words in the current line to the result.\n5. Join the collected lines with newline characters to create the formatted string.\n\nThis function will systematically add line breaks to prevent any line from having a width exceeding the maximum allowed, taking into account spaces between words.\n\n### Code\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= (length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    wrapped_text = join(lines, \"\\n\")\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\n## Example Output\n\nThe function should produce a wrapped text like this:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\neach line does not exceed 10 characters, considering spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[162,368],"elapsed":8.841837833,"cost":0.01266,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1047055098,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
