Each line's maximum length will be as close as possible to, but not exceeding, the designated width (unless a single word exceeds that width itself).","status":200,"tokens":[162,475],"elapsed":16.744178708,"cost":0.015870000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1667229075,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
