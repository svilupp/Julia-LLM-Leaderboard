Note that the default width is 10 characters, but it can be adjusted by supplying a different value for `text_width`. The example provided demonstrates how the function works with a longer sentence and the default text width.","status":200,"tokens":[93,239],"elapsed":11.529922958,"cost":0.0081,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-393635294,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
