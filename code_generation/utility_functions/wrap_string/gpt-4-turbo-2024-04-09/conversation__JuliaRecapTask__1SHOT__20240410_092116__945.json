[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It returns a wrapped version of the text string.\n\n2. **Splitting the Text**: Split the input string into an array of words using whitespace as a delimiter.\n\n3. **Word Appending and Wrapping**:\n   - Initialize an empty string `result` to build the final output.\n   - Initialize a variable, say `current_line`, to keep track of the characters added to the current line.\n   - Iterate through each word:\n     - If adding the word and a space (if required) keeps the length of `current_line` within `text_width`, append it.\n     - Otherwise, append `current_line` to `result`, reset `current_line` and start it with the new word.\n   - After iterating through all words, append any content remaining in `current_line` to the `result`.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty input string should simply return an empty string.\n   - A very long single word exceeding `text_width` can't be split and should be placed on its own line.\n\n4. **Creating an Example**: After the function implementation, a sample string will be used to demonstrate the function.\n\n## Recall Julia Snippets\n\n- Creating a function: `function wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)`\n- Splitting a string into words: `words = split(text)`\n- String concatenation: `result *= word`, string interpolation: `\"$(var)\"`\n- Iterating through an array: `for word in words`\n- Checking againt a condition: `if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 â‰¤ text_width`\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_line == \"\" || length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if current_line != \"\"\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\nexample_text = \"Julia is popular among technical and scientific computing communities.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 15))\n```\n\nThe function initializes and populates the lines according to the max width, adding new lines as necessary. The example illustrates its use with a width of 15 for better visualization.\n\nNow, let's double-check:\n- Variables and flows seems logically correct.\n- Iterations and conditions are appropriately placed to prevent overrun of the specified width.\n- Input/output specification matches the requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[317,642],"elapsed":23.813592375,"cost":0.02243,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1590543979,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
