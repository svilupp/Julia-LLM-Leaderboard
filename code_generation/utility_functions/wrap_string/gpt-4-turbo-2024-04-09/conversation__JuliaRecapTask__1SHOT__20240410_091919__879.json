[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Splitting the input string into words.\n2. Iterating over each word and constructing lines where the addition of a new word doesn’t exceed the specified `text_width`.\n3. Using conditions and loops effectively to form these lines and manage characters including spaces.\n\nThe function will utilize control structures to manage word addition and ensure the total length does not surpass the set limit. This task will involve conditionally deciding whether to add a word to the existing line or start a new line.\n\nHere’s the pseudocode based approach:\n- Initialize an empty result string to hold the wrapped text.\n- Use a current line string to add words until it reaches or exceeds the limit.\n- For each word, check if appending it to the current line would exceed the maximum width.\n  - If it does not exceed, append it with a leading space (if it's not the first word on the line).\n  - If it exceeds, append the current line to the result, start a new line with this word.\n- After processing all words, if there’s any remaining text in the current line, add it to the result.\n\nThis ensures appropriate control over the formatting and uses fundamental Julia constructs to perform string concatenation and loops.\n\nWe will then proceed to implement this in the `wrap_string` function with an example usage to validate.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_string::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_string)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the maximum width\n        if length(current_line) == 0\n            new_line = word  # For the first word in a line\n        else\n            new_line = current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n        \n        if length(new_line) > text_width\n            # If current line isn't empty, add it to the result\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            end\n            current_line = word  # Start new line with the current word\n        else\n            current_line = new_line  # Add word to the current line\n        end\n    end\n\n    # After loop, if there's any residual line\n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        result *= current_line  # Add the last line\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\nwrap_string(\"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language\", 14)\n```\n\nThis function should now respect the 14 width limit and create a new line when required.","status":200,"tokens":[317,550],"elapsed":14.074303167,"cost":0.01967,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1204494169,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
