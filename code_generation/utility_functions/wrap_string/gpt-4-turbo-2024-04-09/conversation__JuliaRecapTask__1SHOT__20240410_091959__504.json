[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Let's start with constructing the function `wrap_string`.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        push!(result, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    final_text = join(result, \"\\n\")\n    return final_text\nend\n\n# Example\ntext = \"This is a text string that we need to wrap based on the specified width.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n```\n\nIn the example, the function wraps the given text string such that no line exceeds 15 characters in width, and prints the output.","status":200,"tokens":[317,466],"elapsed":15.587742375,"cost":0.017150000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-133287745,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
