Split the input string into individual words.\n2. Start creating a resultant string, adding words one by one.\n3. Keep track of the length of the current line.\n4. If adding a new word would exceed the maximum allowed width (`text_width`), append a newline character to the result before the word.\n5. Add spaces between words as long as they are on the same line.\n6. Return the final constructed string with appropriate line breaks.\n\n## Julia Code\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"  # Start a new line\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"  # Add a space before the word (except at line start)\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThe example `wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")` returns a wrapped version of the input string, where lines do not exceed `10` characters, demonstrating the intended functionality of the function with a straightforward `text_width` constraint. Just run the provided function to check its correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[162,330],"elapsed":10.434820416,"cost":0.01152,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":576315988,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
