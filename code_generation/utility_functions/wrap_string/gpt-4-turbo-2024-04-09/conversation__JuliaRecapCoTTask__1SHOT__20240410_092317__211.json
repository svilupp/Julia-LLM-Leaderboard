[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To address the task, we'll create a function in Julia named `wrap_string` which will take two parameters: a string and an optional maximum text width, defaulting to 10. The function will process the string by splitting it into words, and then successively appending each word to a line until adding another word would exceed the maximum width. At that point, it will start a new line.\n\nFirst, recall the important Julia snippets:\n- **String manipulation**: Strings are concatenated using `*` in Julia.\n- **Iterating**: `for` loop can be used to iterate over the words of the string.\n\nThe procedure inside `wrap_string` will be:\n1. Split the string into words.\n2. Initialize a current line and the final result.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n   - If adding the word (plus a space if it's not the first word on the line) exceeds `text_width`, append the current line to the result and start a new line with the word.\n   - Otherwise, add the word to the current line.\n4. Lastly, outside the main loop, make sure to add any leftover content in the current line to the final result.\n\nJulia function implementation would look something like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)    \n    words = split(s)  # Split the string into words based on spaces\n    result = \"\"  # To gather the complete result\n    current_line = \"\"  # To assemble lines before adding them to result\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word exceeds the line width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"  # Append current line and newline\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Add a space before the word if it's not the first word in line\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Append the final line if any\n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example:\ntest_string = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(test_string, 15))\n```\n\nThis function should properly format the input text based on the desired line width. By testing it with the provided example, we can verify that our solution performs as expected. The function is structured in a way that allows for clear understanding and efficient operation.","status":200,"tokens":[318,565],"elapsed":16.094299583,"cost":0.02013,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1350933391,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
