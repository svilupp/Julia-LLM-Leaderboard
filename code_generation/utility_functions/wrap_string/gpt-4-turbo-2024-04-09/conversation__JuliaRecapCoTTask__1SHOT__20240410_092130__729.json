X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

To split the string into words, `split()` is useful. We then need to concatenate words together, ensuring that we do not surpass a given maximum width `text_width`. To concatenate in Julia, we use `*=` for mutating a string by appending.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe `wrap_string` function will:\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Iteratively concatenate these words, adding a space between them unless adding the next word would exceed `text_width`.\n3. If adding the next word plus a space exceeds the `text_width`, we append a newline before the word.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            if length(result) > 0\n                result *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            result *= current_line # Add the current line to result\n            current_line = word    # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \" # Add space before the word if not the first word in line\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        if length(result) > 0\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        result *= current_line\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\nexample_string = \"Julia is a high-performance, high-level programming language\"\nprint(wrap_string(example_string, 20))\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that words are properly wrapped according to the `text_width` and that wrapping occurs only if adding another word (with a space) would surpass the width limit. We also avoid placing spaces at the start of a new line and the example shows how the function operates within the constraints of `text_width = 20`.","status":200,"tokens":[318,449],"elapsed":14.092041917,"cost":0.01665,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1552259957,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
