[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function will process the input string word by word, attempting to fit each word into lines respecting the maximum width specified by `text_width`. A newline character (`\\n`) is used to break lines exceeding `text_width`.\n\nEach word including spaces (except possibly before the newline) counts towards the length of a line. After processing, the resultant string with appropriately placed newline characters is returned.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia along with a sample example usage.\n\n## Julia Implementation of `wrap_string`\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)\n    if isempty(words)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # If adding this word exceeds the line width, move to a new line (unless it's the first word in the line)\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        # Need to handle space before words that aren't the first in a line\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example Usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 20))\n```\n\nThe function starts by splitting the input `s` into words. It then iterates over each word, checking if adding the word to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If it would, a newline is inserted and the length counter resets. Each word is then appended to the result string, and spaces are managed appropriately between words in the current line. The resulting string with formatted newline placements is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[318,431],"elapsed":10.70754,"cost":0.01611,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1908851373,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
