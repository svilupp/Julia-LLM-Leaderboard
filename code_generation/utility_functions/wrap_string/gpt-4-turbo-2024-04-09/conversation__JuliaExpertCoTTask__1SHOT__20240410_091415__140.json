Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Approach:\n\n1. Define the function `wrap_string` with the inputs: a string to process and an optional parameter for `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. Split the input string into words using the default whitespace separator.\n3. Initialize a `result` string to build the output and a counter `line_length` to track the width of the current line being built.\n4. Iterate over each word in the input:\n   - If adding the word to the current line `result` (along with a space if it's not the first word on the line) would exceed the `text_width`, append a newline character to `result` and reset the `line_length`.\n   - Append the word to the `result` and adjust the `line_length`.\n5. Finally, return the `result`.\n\nNow I'll write the function and provide an example below.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if line_length + word_length > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        if line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            line_length += 1\n        end\n        result *= word\n        line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\n\nThis function should correctly wrap the string `'This function will wrap words into lines'` with a maximum width of 10 characters per line. Since the widest individual word is at least 4 characters and up to 8 (\"function\"), this width is sufficient for at least one word per line and a few cases with two words per line.","status":200,"tokens":[162,383],"elapsed":15.804962958,"cost":0.01311,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":560909358,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
