It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is an example of how you can write a function in Julia named `wrap_string` that takes a single string input and a maximum text width (`text_width`), then efficiently wraps the text to a new line whenever adding another word would exceed the specified `text_width`. This implementation makes sure that individual lines do not exceed the text width limit unless a single word itself is longer than the `text_width`.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1  # for space\n        end\n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere is how you might use this function:\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprint(wrapped_text)\n```\nThis should output something like:\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-level,\nhigh-performance\ndynamic\nprogramming\nlanguage for\ntechnical\ncomputing.\n```\n\nThis example wraps the given text where the maximum width of any line does not exceed 15 characters. Words themselves are not broken apart; the function simply moves entire words to the next line when adding another word would exceed the maximum width. Adjust the `text_width` value based on your needs to see different wrapping behaviors.","status":200,"tokens":[58,373],"elapsed":11.905221834,"cost":0.011770000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-497871839,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
