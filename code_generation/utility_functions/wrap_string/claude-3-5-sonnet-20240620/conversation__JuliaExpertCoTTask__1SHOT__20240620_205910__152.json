Let's implement the `wrap_string` function following the problem-solving steps.\n\nStep 1: Think through the approach\n- Split the input string into words\n- Iterate through words, adding them to a line\n- If adding a word would exceed the text_width, start a new line\n- Join the lines with newline characters\n\nStep 2 & 3: Write the function and solve the task\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\n\nLet's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function works as expected. It wraps the words into lines, ensuring that each line doesn't exceed the default `text_width` of 10 characters.\n\nLet's test it with a custom `text_width`:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", text_width=15)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```\n\nThe function correctly handles the custom `text_width` of 15 characters.\n\nThe `wrap_string` function is now implemented and working as required.","status":200,"tokens":[168,442],"elapsed":5.754410625,"cost":0.007134000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17998,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
