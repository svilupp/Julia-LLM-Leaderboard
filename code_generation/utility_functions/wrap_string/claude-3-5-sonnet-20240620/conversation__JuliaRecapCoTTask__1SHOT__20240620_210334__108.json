[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write a function `wrap_string` that wraps text to a specified width. Then, I'll provide an example of how to use it.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line != \"\" ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line = current_line == \"\" ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, strip(current_line))\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's break down the function:\n\n1. We start by splitting the input `text` into words.\n2. We initialize an array `lines` to store our wrapped lines and a `current_line` string.\n3. We iterate over each word:\n   - If adding the word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, we push the current line to `lines` and start a new line with the current word.\n   - Otherwise, we add the word to the current line.\n4. After the loop, if there's any remaining text in `current_line`, we add it to `lines`.\n5. Finally, we join all the lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped to multiple lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped to\nmultiple lines\n```\n\nIn this example, we've set the `text_width` to 15 characters. The function wraps the text, ensuring that each line doesn't exceed 15 characters (including spaces), except when a single word is longer than the specified width.\n\nThis implementation is flexible and can handle various text inputs and width specifications. It preserves whole words (doesn't split them across lines) unless a single word is longer than the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[345,555],"elapsed":8.4574935,"cost":0.00936,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13232,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
