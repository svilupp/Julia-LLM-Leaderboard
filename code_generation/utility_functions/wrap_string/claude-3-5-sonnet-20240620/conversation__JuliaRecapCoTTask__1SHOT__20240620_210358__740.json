[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write the `wrap_string` function as requested and provide an example. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if isempty(current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        elseif length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    isempty(current_line) || push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's break down the function and explain its parts:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `text` (the input string) and `text_width` (default value of 10).\n2. We split the input `text` into words.\n3. We initialize an empty array `lines` to store our wrapped lines and a `current_line` string.\n4. We iterate through each word:\n   - If the `current_line` is empty, we add the word to it.\n   - If adding the word (plus a space) to the `current_line` doesn't exceed `text_width`, we add it.\n   - Otherwise, we push the `current_line` to `lines` and start a new line with the current word.\n5. After the loop, we add the last line if it's not empty.\n6. Finally, we join all the lines with newline characters and return the result.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped to fit within a certain width\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nstring that\nneeds to be\nwrapped to fit\nwithin a\ncertain width\n```\n\nIn this example, we set the `text_width` to 15 characters. The function wraps the text so that each line is at most 15 characters wide (including spaces), adding new lines as necessary.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and follows Julia best practices:\n- It uses abstract types (`AbstractString`) for better compatibility.\n- It avoids unnecessary allocations by building the lines incrementally.\n- It uses Julia's built-in functions like `split`, `push!`, and `join`.\n- The function is clear and easy to understand, with each step serving a specific purpose.","status":200,"tokens":[345,632],"elapsed":8.726149166,"cost":0.010515,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20094,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
