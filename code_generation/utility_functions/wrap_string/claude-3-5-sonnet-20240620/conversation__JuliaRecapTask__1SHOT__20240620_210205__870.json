[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write the `wrap_string` function as requested and provide an example. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line != \"\" ? 1 : 0) <= text_width\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : \"$current_line $word\"\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    !isempty(current_line) && push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. We start by splitting the input `text` into words.\n2. We initialize an array `lines` to store each wrapped line and a `current_line` string to build each line.\n3. We iterate through each word:\n   - If adding the word (and a space if needed) doesn't exceed `text_width`, we add it to the `current_line`.\n   - Otherwise, we push the `current_line` to `lines` and start a new line with the current word.\n4. After the loop, we add any remaining text in `current_line` to `lines`.\n5. Finally, we join all the lines with newline characters.\n\nNow, let's provide an example to demonstrate how this function works:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 12)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a\nlong string\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped\n```\n\nIn this example, we set the `text_width` to 12 characters. The function wraps the text, ensuring that each line doesn't exceed 12 characters (including spaces), except when a single word is longer than the specified width.\n\nYou can also use the default `text_width` of 10:\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text_default = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text_default)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a\nlong\nstring\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped\n```\n\nThis function handles the wrapping efficiently and works with any given `text_width`. It also properly handles cases where a single word might be longer than the specified width, placing such words on their own lines.","status":200,"tokens":[344,612],"elapsed":8.892821375,"cost":0.010212,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
