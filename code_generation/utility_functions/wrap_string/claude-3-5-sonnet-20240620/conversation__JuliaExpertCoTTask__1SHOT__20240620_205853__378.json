It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! I'll follow the problem-solving steps to create the `wrap_string` function.\n\n1. Think through the approach:\n   - Split the input string into words\n   - Iterate through words, adding them to a line\n   - If adding a word would exceed the text_width, start a new line\n   - Join the lines with newline characters\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   The function is now implemented according to the specifications.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   Let's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function works as expected, wrapping the text at the default `text_width` of 10 characters.\n\nHere's an additional example with a custom `text_width`:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 15)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```\n\nThe function successfully wraps the text according to the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[168,425],"elapsed":6.020561583,"cost":0.0068790000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21038,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
