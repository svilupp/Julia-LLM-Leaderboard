Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's solve this task step by step:\n\n1. Define the function `wrap_string` with parameters `text` and `text_width`\n2. Split the input text into words\n3. Iterate through words, keeping track of line length\n4. Add words to the current line if they fit, otherwise start a new line\n5. Join the wrapped lines and return the result\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example\nexample_text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```\n\nThis implementation wraps the words into lines with a maximum width of 15 characters (including spaces). You can adjust the `text_width` parameter to change the maximum line length.","status":200,"tokens":[168,342],"elapsed":5.415384083,"cost":0.005634,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28928,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
