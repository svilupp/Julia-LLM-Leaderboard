Let's implement the `wrap_string` function as requested.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the `wrap_string` function that takes a `text` string and an optional `text_width` parameter with a default value of 10.\n2. We split the input text into words.\n3. We iterate through the words, adding them to the current line if it doesn't exceed the `text_width`.\n4. If adding a word would exceed the `text_width`, we start a new line.\n5. We join the resulting lines with newline characters.\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis output demonstrates that the function correctly wraps the words into lines, ensuring that each line does not exceed the maximum width of 10 characters (by default).\n\nYou can also test the function with a different `text_width`:\n\n```julia\nresult_width_15 = wrap_string(example_text, 15)\nprintln(result_width_15)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```\n\nThis shows that the function is flexible and can accommodate different maximum line widths as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[168,525],"elapsed":8.363101458,"cost":0.008379,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22499,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
