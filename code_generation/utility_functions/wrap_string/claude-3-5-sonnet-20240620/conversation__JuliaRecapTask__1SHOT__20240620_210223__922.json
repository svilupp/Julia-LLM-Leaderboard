[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write a function `wrap_string` that wraps text based on a maximum width. Then, I'll provide an example of how to use it.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line != \"\" ? 1 : 0) <= text_width\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    !isempty(current_line) && push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. We start by splitting the input `text` into words.\n2. We initialize an empty array `lines` to store our wrapped lines and a `current_line` string.\n3. We iterate over each word:\n   - If adding the word to the current line (including a space if needed) doesn't exceed `text_width`, we add it.\n   - Otherwise, we push the current line to `lines` and start a new line with the current word.\n4. After the loop, we add any remaining text in `current_line` to `lines`.\n5. Finally, we join all the lines with newline characters.\n\nNow, let's provide an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is an example of text wrapping in Julia\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is an\nexample of text\nwrapping in\nJulia\n```\n\nIn this example, we set the `text_width` to 15 characters. The function wraps the text, ensuring that each line doesn't exceed 15 characters (including spaces).\n\nYou can also use the default `text_width` of 10:\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text_default = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text_default)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is an\nexample of\ntext\nwrapping\nin Julia\n```\n\nThis function handles the wrapping efficiently and works with any input string and text width. It's also flexible enough to handle very long words or very short text widths gracefully.","status":200,"tokens":[344,602],"elapsed":9.3149695,"cost":0.010062,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
