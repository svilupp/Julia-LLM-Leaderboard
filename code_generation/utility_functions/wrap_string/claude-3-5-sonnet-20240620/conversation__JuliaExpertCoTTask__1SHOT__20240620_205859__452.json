Let's implement the `wrap_string` function as requested.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define the `wrap_string` function that takes a `text` string and an optional `text_width` parameter with a default value of 10.\n2. We split the input text into words.\n3. We iterate through the words, adding them to the current line if it doesn't exceed the `text_width`.\n4. If adding a word would exceed the `text_width`, we start a new line.\n5. We join the resulting lines with newline characters.\n\nNow, let's run the example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nresult = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThis output demonstrates that the function successfully wraps the words into lines, ensuring that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width` of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[168,429],"elapsed":6.064178333,"cost":0.006939,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28642,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
