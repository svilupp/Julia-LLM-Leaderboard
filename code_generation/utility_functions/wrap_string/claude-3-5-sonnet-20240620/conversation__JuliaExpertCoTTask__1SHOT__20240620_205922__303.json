Think through the approach:\n   - Split the input string into words\n   - Iterate through words, keeping track of line length\n   - Add words to the current line if it fits\n   - Start a new line when the next word would exceed the text width\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width || current_line == \"\"\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   The function is now implemented as requested.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   Let's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nThe function works as expected, wrapping the text at the default `text_width` of 10 characters.\n\nHere's another example with a custom `text_width`:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", 15)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThe quick brown\nfox jumps over\nthe lazy dog\n```\n\nThe function correctly wraps the text at a maximum width of 15 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[168,428],"elapsed":5.615167542,"cost":0.0069240000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20558,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
