[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll write the `wrap_string` function as requested and provide an example. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line != \"\" ? 1 : 0) <= text_width\n            current_line = isempty(current_line) ? word : current_line * \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    !isempty(current_line) && push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's break down the function and provide an example:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters:\n   - `text::AbstractString`: The input string to be wrapped\n   - `text_width::Int=10`: The maximum width for each line (default is 10)\n\n2. We split the input text into words.\n\n3. We iterate over each word:\n   - If adding the word to the current line doesn't exceed `text_width`, we add it.\n   - Otherwise, we add the current line to our list of lines and start a new line with the current word.\n\n4. After the loop, we add the last line if it's not empty.\n\n5. Finally, we join all the lines with newline characters.\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a long\nsentence that\nneeds to be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nIn this example, we set the `text_width` to 15 characters. The function wraps the text, ensuring that each line doesn't exceed 15 characters (including spaces).\n\nLet's also test it with the default `text_width` of 10:\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text_default = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text_default)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis is a\nlong\nsentence\nthat needs\nto be\nwrapped.\n```\n\nThis function efficiently wraps the text while preserving whole words, which is often desirable in text formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[345,586],"elapsed":8.294105083,"cost":0.009825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15071,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
