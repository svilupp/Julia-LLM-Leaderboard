Below is a Julia function `wrap_string` that iterates over words and adds a new line each time a maximum `text_width` (default is 10) would be exceeded. Additionally, I'll provide an example to demonstrate its usage.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            if isempty(current_line)\n                current_line = word\n            else\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            end\n        else\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"This is a sample text that will be wrapped based on the specified text width.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `wrap_string` takes two arguments: `text` (the input string) and `text_width` (the maximum width of each line, default is 10).\n2. **Splitting Words**: The input text is split into words using the `split` function.\n3. **Initialization**: An empty array `lines` is initialized to store the lines of text, and `current_line` is initialized to an empty string to build the current line.\n4. **Iterating Over Words**: The function iterates over each word:\n   - If adding the word to the current line does not exceed the `text_width`, the word is appended to `current_line`.\n   - If adding the word would exceed the `text_width`, the current line is added to `lines`, and `current_line` is reset to the current word.\n5. **Final Line**: After the loop, any remaining text in `current_line` is added to `lines`.\n6. **Joining Lines**: The lines are joined with newline characters to form the final wrapped text.\n\n### Example Output\nFor the given example text and a `text_width` of 10, the output will be:\n```\nThis is a\nsample\ntext that\nwill be\nwrapped\nbased on\nthe\nspecified\ntext width.\n```\n\nThis function ensures that the text is wrapped correctly based on the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[57,612],"elapsed":13.01519275,"cost":0.005679,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-769125736,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
