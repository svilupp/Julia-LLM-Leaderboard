If adding a word would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line. Finally, it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[98,255],"elapsed":5.973966208,"cost":0.002589,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1610222470,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
