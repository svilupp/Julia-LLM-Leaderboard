It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    curr_line = \"\"\n    lines = String[]\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(curr_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, curr_line)\n            curr_line = \"\"\n        end\n        curr_line = curr_line * \" \" * word\n    end\n\n    push!(lines, curr_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")  \nend\n```\n\nIt splits the input text into words, then iterates through the words, keeping track of the current line length. If adding the next word would exceed the text width, it starts a new line. Finally it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.\n\nHere is an example of using it:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a sample text that will be wrapped to demonstrate the function.\"\n\nwrapped = wrap_string(text)\nprint(wrapped)\n```\n\nThis would print:\n\n```\nThis is a \nsample text \nthat will be \nwrapped to \ndemonstrate \nthe function.\n```\n\nThe default text width is 10 characters, but a custom width can be specified as the second argument to `wrap_string`.","status":200,"tokens":[95,308],"elapsed":13.519524875,"cost":0.008152,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29083,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
