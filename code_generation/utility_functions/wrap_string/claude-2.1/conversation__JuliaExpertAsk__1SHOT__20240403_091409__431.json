When adding the next word would exceed the text width, it starts a new line. After processing all words, it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.\n\nWith the default 10 character width, the output would be:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit.
