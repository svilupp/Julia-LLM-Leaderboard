Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that wraps text to a specified width:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    lines = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if isempty(current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line = current_line * \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIt splits the input text into words, then iterates through the words, adding them to the current line. When the line length exceeds `text_width`, it starts a new line. Finally it joins the lines with newline characters and returns the wrapped string.\n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is some text that I want to wrap to a certain width\"\n\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nWould output:\n\n```\nThis is some\ntext that I\nwant to wrap\nto a certain\nwidth\n```\n\nThe default width is 10 characters but a custom width can be specified as the second argument.","status":200,"tokens":[95,298],"elapsed":12.1853935,"cost":0.007912,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18456,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
