[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Each time the line would exceed the width with another word added, it starts a new line.\n\nHere is an example of using it:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is some sample text that will be wrapped to demonstrate the function.\"\n\nwrapped = wrap_string(text)\nprint(wrapped)\n```\n\n```\nThis is some\nsample text that\nwill be wrapped\nto demonstrate\nthe function.\n```\n\nThe default text width is 10, but it can be customized by passing a different `text_width` argument.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[330,295],"elapsed":11.539256208,"cost":0.00972,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17033,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
