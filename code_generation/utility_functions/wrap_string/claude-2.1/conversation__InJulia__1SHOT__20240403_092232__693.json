If adding the next word would exceed the max text width, it starts a new line. Finally it joins the lines with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[57,278],"elapsed":12.122105291,"cost":0.007128,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18507,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
