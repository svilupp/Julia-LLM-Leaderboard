When adding the next word would exceed the text width, it starts a new line. \n\nHere is an example of using it:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a sample text that will be wrapped to demonstrate the function\"\n\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\n```\nThis is a sample\ntext that will be\nwrapped to\ndemonstrate the\nfunction\n```\n\nThe key aspects are:\n\n- Splitting the text into words \n- Tracking current line length\n- Starting new line when it would exceed the width\n- Building up an array of lines\n- Joining with newlines at the end\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[95,324],"elapsed":12.638203416,"cost":0.008536,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18346,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
