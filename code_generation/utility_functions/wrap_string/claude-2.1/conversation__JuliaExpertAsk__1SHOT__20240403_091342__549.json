When adding the next word would exceed the text width, it prints a new line and resets the current line length counter. It builds the result string in an IOBuffer before converting back to a String at the end.\n\nThe example wraps the text to lines less than 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[95,243],"elapsed":17.8119965,"cost":0.006592000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31561,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
