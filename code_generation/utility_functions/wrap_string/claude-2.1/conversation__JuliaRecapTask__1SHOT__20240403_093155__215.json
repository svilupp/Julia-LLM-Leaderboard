[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It keeps track of the current line in a `line` variable. If adding the next word would exceed the line width, it starts a new line. Otherwise it appends the word to the current line with a space. Each line is collected into a `lines` array. Finally it joins the lines with newline characters.\n\nAn example usage:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is some example text that will be wrapped to demonstrate the function.\"\n\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nPrints:\n\n```\nThis is some\nexample text\nthat will be\nwrapped to\ndemonstrate\nthe function.\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[329,305],"elapsed":12.814449583,"cost":0.009951999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29619,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
