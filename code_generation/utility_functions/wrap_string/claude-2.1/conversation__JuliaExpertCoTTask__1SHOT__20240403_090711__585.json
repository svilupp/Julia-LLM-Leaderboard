At that point it starts a new line. Finally it joins the lines adding newlines between them.\n\nHere is an example of using it:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprint(wrap_string(text)) \n```\n\nOutputs:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples to test!","status":200,"tokens":[172,245],"elapsed":9.44227175,"cost":0.007255999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29669,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
