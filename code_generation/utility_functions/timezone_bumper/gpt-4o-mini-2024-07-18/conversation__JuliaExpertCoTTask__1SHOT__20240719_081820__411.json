If it's not, we should raise an error.\n\n3. **Adding Hours**: If the input is valid, we can proceed to add the `bump` hours to the `DateTime`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the modified `DateTime`.\n\n5. **Testing**: We will test the function with the provided data and ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nNow, I'll implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The input must be a DateTime object.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test with the provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test for an invalid input\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expected to catch and print an error message\nend\n```\n\n### Checking the solution\n1. **Valid Input**: The call to `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` should return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, which is correct.\n  \n2. **Invalid Input**: When passing a `Date` object, it should raise an `ArgumentError`.\n\nThus, both aspects of the problem have been correctly addressed. The function will return the correct modified `DateTime` and throw an error for incorrect types.","status":200,"tokens":[183,443],"elapsed":6.582480625,"cost":0.00029325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":60875826,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
