Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a Julia function named `timezone_bumper` that takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`, which defaults to +3 hours. The function will throw an error if the input is a `Date` type instead of a `DateTime`.\n\nYou can implement it as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided date must be of type DateTime, but a Date was given.\"))\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `timezone_bumper` function takes two parameters: `dt` (the timestamp) and `bump` (the number of hours to add, with a default value of 3).\n2. **Type Annotation**: The first method of the function checks if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is, it adds the specified `bump` hours to `dt`.\n3. **Error Handling**: The second method of the function is defined specifically for `Date` types, which throws an `ArgumentError` if a `Date` is passed to the function.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\n# Creating a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2023, 10, 20, 12, 0)\n\n# Bumping the time by default (3 hours)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(new_time)  # Output: 2023-10-20T15:00:00\n\n# Bumping the time by 5 hours\nnew_time_custom = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(new_time_custom)  # Output: 2023-10-20T17:00:00\n\n# Trying to use a Date object\ndt_date = Date(2023, 10, 20)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(dt_date)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Output: ArgumentError: Provided date must be of type DateTime, but a Date was given.\nend\n```\n\nBy using this function, you can easily manage time adjustments while ensuring that Date types are handled correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[68,467],"elapsed":6.292537417,"cost":0.00029039999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2010712138,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
