Checks if the provided `dt` is of type `DateTime`.\n2. Throws an error if `dt` is of type `Date`.\n3. Increases the timestamp by the specified `bump` hours (defaulting to +3 hours if not provided).\n4. Returns the adjusted `DateTime`.\n\nHere’s how I’ll implement this step by step:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is of type Date\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Increase the DateTime by the specified bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nNow let's solve the task by running the `timezone_bumper` function to check its correctness. \n\n### Checking the solution\n1. When I call `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)`, the expected output should be `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.\n2. Additionally, I will handle the type checking for `Date`.\n\n### Running the Test\n```julia\n# Test case\ntest_dt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\ntest_bump = 3\nresult = timezone_bumper(test_dt, test_bump)  # Should output 2023-04-10T15:00:00\nprintln(result)  # Output result\n\n# Test with Date type, should raise an error\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation will work correctly and raise an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[183,434],"elapsed":9.730398333,"cost":0.00028785,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":500724964,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
