Define the function `timezone_bumper` with parameters `dt` and `bump`, where `bump` defaults to 3.\n2. Ensure that the function checks if the provided `dt` is of type `DateTime` and throw an error if it's of type `Date`.\n3. Calculate the new timestamp by adding the given `bump` hours to `dt`.\n4. Return the adjusted `DateTime`.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Uncomment to test error with Date type\n# timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)  # This should throw an error\n```\n\n### Check that the solution is correct\n\n- The function correctly adds 3 hours to the provided `DateTime`.\n- It needs to handle the case where a `Date` is provided to throw an error.\n\nLet's implement the additional check and re-test:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided timestamp must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Check the solution with the provided example\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Should output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test case with Date type (commented for safe execution)\n# timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)  # Uncomment to test error\n```\n\nThe solution is complete and correct based on the requirements and the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[183,447],"elapsed":6.372347458,"cost":0.00029565,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-194560364,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
