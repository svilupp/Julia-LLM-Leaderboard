Define the function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` with a default value of `bump` as 3.\n2. Check if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is not, throw an error.\n3. Increase the `dt` by the specified `bump` hours.\n4. Return the updated `DateTime`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We use the `using Dates` to bring in the Date and Time functions.\n- The function checks if `dt` is an instance of `DateTime`. If not, it raises an `ArgumentError`.\n- We then add the specified number of hours (converted from `Int` to `Hour` type) to `dt`.\n- Finally, we return the adjusted `DateTime`.\n\n### Verification:\nWe can test our function with a try-catch block for valid and invalid types.\n\n```julia\n# Valid usage\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Invalid usage\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))  # Should throw an error\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Print the error message\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation meets the requirements and should work correctly for valid `DateTime` inputs while rejecting `Date` inputs appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[183,434],"elapsed":5.722755708,"cost":0.00028785,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-447597113,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
