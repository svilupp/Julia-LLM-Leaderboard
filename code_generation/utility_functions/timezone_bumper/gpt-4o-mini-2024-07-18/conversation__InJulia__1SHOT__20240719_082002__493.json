Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! You can create a `timezone_bumper` function in Julia that checks the type of the input timestamp and adjusts it accordingly. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check that the argument is of type DateTime\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n\n    # Adjust the timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndt = DateTime(2023, 10, 5, 12, 0) # October 5th, 2023, at 12:00 PM\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # Increase by 5 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Should print October 5th, 2023, at 5:00 PM\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `timezone_bumper` is defined to take a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` that defaults to 3.\n2. **Type Checking**: The function checks if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an `ArgumentError`.\n3. **Time Adjustment**: The function adds hours to the provided `DateTime` using `Hour(bump)`.\n4. **Example Usage**: You can see an example at the end demonstrating how to use the function.\n\nThis function will raise an error if you pass a `Date` or any other datatype. You can test the function by passing various `DateTime` values or invalid types to see how it behaves.","status":200,"tokens":[68,361],"elapsed":6.082050375,"cost":0.00022679999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1299890254,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
