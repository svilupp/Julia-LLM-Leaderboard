The function uses the `Dates` package, which is included in Julia's standard library. Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The input must be a DateTime object\"))\n    end\n\n    bumped_dt = dt .+ Hour(bump)\n    return bumped_dt\nend\n\n# Test the function\ndt = DateTime(\"2022-01-01 12:00:00\")\nprint(\"Original DateTime: \")\nprint(dt)\nprintln()\n\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprint(\"Bumped DateTime (+3 hours): \")\nprint(bumped_dt)\nprintln()\n\n# Test with an error for Date type\ndate = Date(\"2022-01-01\")\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(date)\ncatch e\n    println(\"Error: \", e.msg)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `timezone_bumper` that takes in a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` argument for the number of hours to bump the timezone (defaulting to 3 hours). It checks if the input is a `DateTime` object and throws an error if it's not. Then, it calculates the new timestamp by adding the given number of hours to the original timestamp and returns it.\n\nDuring testing, it prints the original and bumped timestamps. It also demonstrates the error thrown when using a `Date` object as the input.","status":200,"tokens":[66,411],"elapsed":4.465912292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":572783737,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
