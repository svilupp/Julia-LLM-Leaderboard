The first function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` (which defaults to 3 hours). It converts the DateTime to its Unix timestamp format (`dt.value`), adds the number of seconds equivalent to `bump` hours (3600 seconds per hour), and creates a new DateTime object with the same timezone (`dt.tz`).\n\nThe second function takes a `Date` object and an integer `bump` (which also defaults to 3 hours), but it simply throws an error to indicate that the function does not support Date types. By doing this, if a Date is passed as an argument, Julia will call the second function and raise the error, preventing unexpected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[66,311],"elapsed":7.732203209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1566276763,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
