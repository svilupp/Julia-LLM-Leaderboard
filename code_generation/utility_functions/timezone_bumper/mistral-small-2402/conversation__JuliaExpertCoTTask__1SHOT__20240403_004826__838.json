If it's not, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message.\n\nThen, the function adds the given number of hours to the input timestamp using the `Hour` unit from the `Dates` module. The result is returned.\n\nIn the example usage, the function is called with a specific DateTime object and the default bump value of 3. The result is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[205,292],"elapsed":3.904541375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1127486864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
