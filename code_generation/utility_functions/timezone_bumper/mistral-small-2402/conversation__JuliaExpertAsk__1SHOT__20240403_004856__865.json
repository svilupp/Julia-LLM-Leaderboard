Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should meet your requirements:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a DateTime object, and `bump`, which is an integer representing the number of hours to add to the timestamp. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if the input `dt` is of type DateTime. If it is not, an ArgumentError is thrown with a message indicating that the input must be a DateTime type.\n\nIf the input `dt` is a DateTime object, then the function returns a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours ahead of the original timestamp. This is done using the Dates.Hour constructor to create a Duration object representing the number of hours to add, and then adding that duration to the original DateTime object.\n\nNote that the Dates.Hour constructor is used here to create a Duration object representing the number of hours to add. This is a more idiomatic and readable way of doing this than manually constructing a Duration object using Dates.Minute or Dates.Second.\n\nAlso note that the function does not modify the original DateTime object, but rather returns a new DateTime object that represents the adjusted timestamp. This is a common convention in Julia, and is often preferable to mutating the original object in place.","status":200,"tokens":[107,349],"elapsed":3.750798042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1151694475,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
