The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nThe function converts the DateTime to a Unix timestamp (in seconds), adds the number of seconds corresponding to `bump` hours, and then converts the result back to a DateTime. The original timezone of the input DateTime is preserved.\n\nIf the input `dt` is a Date type, the function throws an error, as it only supports DateTime type.","status":200,"tokens":[66,271],"elapsed":3.000011334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-171827527,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
