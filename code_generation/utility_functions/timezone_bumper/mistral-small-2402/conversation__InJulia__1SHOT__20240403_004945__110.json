This is called function overloading.\n- The first function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` as input. It increments the input timestamp by `bump` hours (defaulting to 3 hours) and returns the resulting `DateTime` object.\n- The second function takes a `Date` object and an integer `bump` as input. It throws an error, stating that the function only works for `DateTime` types.\n- It is important to define the second function, because without it, Julia would use the first function for both `DateTime` and `Date` objects, which would result in an error when trying to add hours to a `Date` object.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z\")\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T03:00:00\n```\n\nAnd it will throw an error when you try to use it with a `Date` object:\n\n```julia\ndt = Date(\"2022-01-01\")\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # This will throw an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[66,492],"elapsed":12.316834834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-217482558,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
