Please provide a DateTime instead of a Date.\")\nend\n```\n\nThe first function takes a DateTime type as an argument and increases it by the provided number of hours. If no argument is provided for bump, it defaults to 3 hours. The second function takes a Date type as an argument and throws an error, as the function is only intended to work with DateTime types.","status":200,"tokens":[66,185],"elapsed":2.044708958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":703900894,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
