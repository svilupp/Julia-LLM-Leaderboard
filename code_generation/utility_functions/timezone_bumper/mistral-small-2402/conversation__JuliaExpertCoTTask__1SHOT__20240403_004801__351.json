The function signature specifies that the first argument `dt` must be a `DateTime` object and the second argument `bump` is an `Int` with a default value of 3.\n2. The first line inside the function checks if the input `dt` is a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime` object. If it is, then an `ArgumentError` is thrown with an appropriate error message.\n3. If `dt` is a `DateTime` object, then we add `bump` number of hours to it using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module and return the new `DateTime` object.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nThis shows that adding 3 hours to the input `DateTime` object results in a new `DateTime` object that represents 3 PM on April 10, 2023.","status":200,"tokens":[205,346],"elapsed":8.073772042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1593294211,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
