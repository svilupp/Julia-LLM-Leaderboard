The first method `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` takes a DateTime object and an optional `bump` value (defaulting to 3 hours). It adds `bump` hours to `dt` using the `+` operator and `Hour(bump)` from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method `timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)` is a fallback for `Date` objects. It throws a `MethodError` indicating that the function only works with `DateTime` types.\n\n3. The test cases demonstrate the usage:\n   - The first two calls print the expected \"bumped\" `DateTime` objects.\n   - The third call tries to pass a `Date` object, which throws the expected `MethodError`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that `timezone_bumper` works only for `DateTime` types and throws a clear error for `Date` types, as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[223,458],"elapsed":9.969280667,"cost":0.0075390000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31258,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
