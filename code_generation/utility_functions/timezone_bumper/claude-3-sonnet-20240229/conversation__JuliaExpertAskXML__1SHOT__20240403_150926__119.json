The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object incremented by `bump` hours using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It throws an `ErrorException` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date\".\n\nThis ensures that the function behaves as specified, incrementing `DateTime` objects by the given number of hours, while throwing an error if a `Date` object is provided instead.","status":200,"tokens":[108,238],"elapsed":5.124325542,"cost":0.0038940000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24809,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
