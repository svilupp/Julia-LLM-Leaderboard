The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 if not provided). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours ahead of the input `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` with the message `\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime objects, not Date objects.\"`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected for `DateTime` objects, and throws an informative error if a `Date` object is provided instead.","status":200,"tokens":[103,226],"elapsed":4.908431709,"cost":0.003699,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6113,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
