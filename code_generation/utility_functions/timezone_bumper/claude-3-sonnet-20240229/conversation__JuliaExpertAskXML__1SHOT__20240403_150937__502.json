It uses the `+` operator to add the specified number of hours (`Hour(bump)`) to the `DateTime`. If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe second method takes a `Date` and throws an `ArgumentError` with an informative message. This prevents the function from being called with a `Date` argument, since it's meant to operate only on `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[108,204],"elapsed":5.796745458,"cost":0.0033840000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17848,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
