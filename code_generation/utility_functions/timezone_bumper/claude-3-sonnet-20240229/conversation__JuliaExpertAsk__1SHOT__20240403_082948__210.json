The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (which defaults to 3 if not provided). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than the original `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\"\n\nThis implementation ensures that `timezone_bumper` works correctly for `DateTime` objects, adding the specified number of hours to the timestamp. If a `Date` object is passed instead, it will raise an error with an informative message.","status":200,"tokens":[103,240],"elapsed":4.867649541,"cost":0.003909,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
