The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 if not provided). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types, not Date\".\n\nThis ensures that the function works as expected for `DateTime` objects, but throws an appropriate error when called with a `Date` object, as per the requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[108,218],"elapsed":4.875513542,"cost":0.003594,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13634,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
