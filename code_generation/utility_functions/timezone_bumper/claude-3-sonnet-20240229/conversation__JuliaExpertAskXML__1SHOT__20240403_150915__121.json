The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws a `MethodError` with a custom error message indicating that `timezone_bumper` is not defined for `Date` types.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works correctly for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, as specified in the question.","status":200,"tokens":[108,215],"elapsed":4.16951875,"cost":0.003549,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28602,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
