The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours ahead of `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` explicitly stating that `timezone_bumper` only accepts `DateTime` types, not `Date`.\n\nThis design ensures that the function behaves as expected for `DateTime` inputs while providing a clear error message when a `Date` is passed, preventing any unintended behavior or silent errors.","status":200,"tokens":[108,222],"elapsed":5.477343542,"cost":0.003654,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12461,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
