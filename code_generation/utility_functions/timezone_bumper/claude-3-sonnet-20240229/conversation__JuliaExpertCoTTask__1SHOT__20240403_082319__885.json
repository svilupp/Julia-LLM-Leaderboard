The first method definition `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` for the number of hours to bump. If no `bump` value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n2. Inside the method, it returns a new `DateTime` object by adding the `Hour(bump)` to the input `dt`.\n3. The second method definition `timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int=3)` accepts a `Date` object and an optional `Int` for the number of hours to bump.\n4. Inside this method, it throws an `ErrorException` with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` only accepts `DateTime` types, not `Date` types.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function only works for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, as per the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[189,471],"elapsed":8.660511292,"cost":0.007632,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
