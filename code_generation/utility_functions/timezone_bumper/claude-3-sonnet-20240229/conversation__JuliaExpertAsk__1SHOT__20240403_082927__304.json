Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (dt, bump)))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n1. The first method accepts a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `Int` `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object by adding `bump` hours to `dt` using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method accepts a `Date` object `dt` and an optional `Int` `bump` (defaulting to 3). However, instead of performing any operation, it throws a `MethodError` to indicate that the function is not defined for `Date` objects.\n\nBy using multiple method definitions, the appropriate method will be dispatched based on the input type. If a `DateTime` is provided, the first method will be called and the timestamp will be increased by the specified number of hours. If a `Date` is provided, the second method will be called and a `MethodError` will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[103,291],"elapsed":5.080232416,"cost":0.004674,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11193,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
