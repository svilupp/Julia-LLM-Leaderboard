The `timezone_bumper` function is defined with two methods: one for `DateTime` types and one for `Date` types.\n2. For `DateTime` types, the function uses `dt + Hour(bump)` to add the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime` object.\n3. For `Date` types, the function throws an error using the `error` function.\n4. In the example usage, a `DateTime` object is created and passed to `timezone_bumper(dt, 3)`, which outputs the bumped time correctly.\n5. When a `Date` object is passed to `timezone_bumper(d, 3)`, it throws the expected error.\n\nThis implementation follows the given task by:\n- Providing a function `timezone_bumper` that increases a timestamp by a specified number of hours (defaulting to 3 hours).\n- Ensuring that the function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[189,422],"elapsed":8.041294584,"cost":0.006897,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13644,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
