The first method accepts a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 if not provided). It returns a new `DateTime` object incremented by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method accepts a `Date` object `dt` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime objects\".\n\nThis ensures that the function only operates on `DateTime` types and throws an explicit error when a `Date` object is passed, as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[108,225],"elapsed":5.055238167,"cost":0.003699,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4547,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
