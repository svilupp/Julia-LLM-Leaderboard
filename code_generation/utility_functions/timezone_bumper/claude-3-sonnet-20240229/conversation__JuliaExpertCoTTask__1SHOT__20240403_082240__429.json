Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `timezone_bumper` that follows the given task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\"))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The first method `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `Int` argument `bump` with a default value of 3.\n   - It returns a new `DateTime` object by adding `bump` hours to the input `dt` using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method `timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)` takes a `Date` object `dt` and an `Int` argument `bump`.\n   - It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message stating that the function only works with `DateTime` types and not `Date` types.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, as per the task.\n\nYou can test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\nERROR: ArgumentError: timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\n```\n\nThe function correctly increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[189,450],"elapsed":8.723115959,"cost":0.007317,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16443,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
