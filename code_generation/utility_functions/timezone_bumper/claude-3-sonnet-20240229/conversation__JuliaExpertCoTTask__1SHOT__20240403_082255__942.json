The `timezone_bumper` function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3).\n2. It returns a new `DateTime` object by adding `bump` hours to the input `dt` using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n3. A separate `timezone_bumper` method is defined for the `Date` type, which throws an `ArgumentError` with a custom message.\n4. In the example usage, the first two lines demonstrate the successful usage of `timezone_bumper` with `DateTime` objects, with and without specifying the `bump` argument.\n5. The last line attempts to call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` object, which will throw the expected `ArgumentError`.\n\nThis implementation follows the task requirements, ensuring that `timezone_bumper` works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[189,409],"elapsed":7.420232292,"cost":0.006702,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30792,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
