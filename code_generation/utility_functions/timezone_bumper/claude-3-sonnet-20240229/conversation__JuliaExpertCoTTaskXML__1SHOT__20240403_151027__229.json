For `DateTime`, it bumps the timestamp by the specified number of hours. For `Date`, it throws an error as required. The test cases validate the expected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[223,355],"elapsed":6.855366875,"cost":0.005994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1004,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
