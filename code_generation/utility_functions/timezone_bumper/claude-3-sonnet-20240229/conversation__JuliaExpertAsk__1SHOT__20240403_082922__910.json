Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date input is not supported. Please provide a DateTime input.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n1. The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than `dt`.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `Date` inputs are not supported and a `DateTime` input should be provided instead.\n\nThe first method uses the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module to create a `Period` object representing the specified number of hours. This `Period` is then added to the input `DateTime` object using the `+` operator, which returns a new `DateTime` object shifted by the specified number of hours.\n\nBy defining separate methods for `DateTime` and `Date` inputs, the function ensures that `Date` inputs are caught and an appropriate error is thrown, while `DateTime` inputs are processed as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[103,298],"elapsed":6.713334125,"cost":0.004779,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25751,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
