Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that takes a DateTime object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 hours), and returns a new DateTime object with the time increased by the specified number of hours. It also includes error handling for Date types:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime objects, not Date objects.\")\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The first method `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 hours) as arguments.\n    - It returns a new `DateTime` object by adding the specified number of hours (`Hour(bump)`) to the input `DateTime` object `dt`.\n\n2. The second method `timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)` is a fallback method that throws an error if a `Date` object is passed as an argument.\n    - This method is required because Julia's type system cannot distinguish between `DateTime` and `Date` objects without explicit type declarations.\n    - If a `Date` object is passed to the function, it will throw an error with the message \"timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime objects, not Date objects.\"\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\n# Example 1: Increase a DateTime by the default 3 hours\ndt1 = DateTime(2023, 4, 15, 10, 30)\nnew_dt1 = timezone_bumper(dt1)\nprintln(new_dt1) # Output: 2023-04-15T13:30:00\n\n# Example 2: Increase a DateTime by 5 hours\ndt2 = DateTime(2023, 4, 15, 10, 30)\nnew_dt2 = timezone_bumper(dt2, 5)\nprintln(new_dt2) # Output: 2023-04-15T15:30:00\n\n# Example 3: Trying to pass a Date object (should throw an error)\nd = Date(2023, 4, 15)\ntry\n    new_d = timezone_bumper(d)\ncatch err\n    println(err) # Output: timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime objects, not Date objects.\nend\n```\n\nIn the last example, the `timezone_bumper` function throws an error when a `Date` object is passed as an argument, as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[66,616],"elapsed":11.483202208,"cost":0.009438,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
