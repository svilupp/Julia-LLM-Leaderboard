The `timezone_bumper` function is defined with two methods, one for `DateTime` and one for `Date`.\n2. The `DateTime` method takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and `bump` of type `Int` with a default value of `3`.\n3. The function adds `bump` hours to the `dt` using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module and returns the new `DateTime`.\n4. The `Date` method throws an error when called, as per the requirement of the task.\n5. Examples are provided at the end, demonstrating the usage of the function with different combinations of arguments.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes the `Dates` module is imported (e.g., `using Dates`).","status":200,"tokens":[189,364],"elapsed":7.13724275,"cost":0.006027,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6291,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
