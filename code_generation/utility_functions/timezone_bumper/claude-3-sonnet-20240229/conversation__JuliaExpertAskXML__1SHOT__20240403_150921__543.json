The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 if not provided). It adds `bump` hours to `dt` using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module and returns the resulting `DateTime`.\n\n2. The second method is a fallback that takes a `Date` object `d` and throws an `ArgumentError` with an informative message.\n\nBy defining separate methods, we can handle `DateTime` and `Date` inputs differently. The first method performs the desired time zone bumping operation, while the second method throws an error to prevent misuse with `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[108,235],"elapsed":5.789996625,"cost":0.003849,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27487,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
