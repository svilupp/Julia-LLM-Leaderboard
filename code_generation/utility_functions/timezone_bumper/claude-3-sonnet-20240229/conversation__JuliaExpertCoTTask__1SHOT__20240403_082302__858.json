The first method defines the `timezone_bumper` function that takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` argument `bump`. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3.\n2. The function adds the specified number of hours (converted to `Hour` type) to the `DateTime` object and returns the new `DateTime`.\n3. The second method is a separate definition for handling `Date` objects. It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that the function only works with `DateTime` objects.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)) # Uses default bump of 3 hours\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\nERROR: ArgumentError: timezone_bumper only works with DateTime objects\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the provided task and ensures that the function only works with `DateTime` objects, throwing an error for `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[189,375],"elapsed":7.3598765,"cost":0.006192,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1897,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
