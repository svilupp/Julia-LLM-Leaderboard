Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types.\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))  # 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# This will throw an error\n# timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The first `timezone_bumper` function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3 if not provided). It adds the `Hour(bump)` to the `dt` and returns the resulting `DateTime`.\n\n2. The second `timezone_bumper` function takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump`. It throws an `ErrorException` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types.\"\n\n3. In the example usage, the first call to `timezone_bumper` with a `DateTime` object and a `bump` of 3 will print the resulting `DateTime` object, which is 3 hours ahead of the original timestamp.\n\n4. The commented line `timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)` will throw an error if uncommented since the function expects a `DateTime` type and not a `Date` type.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the `timezone_bumper` function works only with `DateTime` types and throws an error if a `Date` type is provided, as per the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[189,401],"elapsed":8.559126167,"cost":0.006582,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30464,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
