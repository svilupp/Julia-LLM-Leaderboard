The `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` (the DateTime or Date object) and `bump` (the number of hours to add, defaulting to 3 if not provided).\n2. For `DateTime` objects, the function adds `bump` hours to the timestamp using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module. The result is returned.\n3. For `Date` objects, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with a custom error message.\n4. In the example usage, we call `timezone_bumper` with a `DateTime` object and a `bump` value of 3, which adds 3 hours to the timestamp and prints the result.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that you have imported the `Dates` module (`using Dates`) to have access to the `DateTime` and `Hour` types.","status":200,"tokens":[189,322],"elapsed":6.895871625,"cost":0.005397,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8384,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
