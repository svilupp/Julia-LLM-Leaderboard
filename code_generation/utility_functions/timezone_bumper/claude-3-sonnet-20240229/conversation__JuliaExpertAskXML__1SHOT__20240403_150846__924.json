Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported, please provide a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation includes two method definitions for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n1. The first method accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` (with a default value of 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object incremented by the specified number of hours using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method is defined for the `Date` type and throws an `ArgumentError` with a custom error message indicating that the `Date` type is not supported and a `DateTime` should be provided instead.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# For DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 15, 12, 0, 0)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Bumped by 5 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2023-05-15T17:00:00\n\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Bumped by default 3 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2023-05-15T15:00:00\n\n# For Date\nd = Date(2023, 5, 15)\ntry\n    bumped_d = timezone_bumper(d, 5)\ncatch err\n    println(err)\n    # Output: ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported, please provide a DateTime type.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the `timezone_bumper` function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an `ArgumentError` when a `Date` type is provided, as per your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[108,460],"elapsed":9.087899167,"cost":0.0072239999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":350,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
