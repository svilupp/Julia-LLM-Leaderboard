The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3) as arguments. It returns a new `DateTime` object shifted by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object `d` and an integer `bump` as arguments. It simply throws an `ArgumentError` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\".\n\nThis ensures that the function works as expected for `DateTime` objects, shifting the timestamp by the specified number of hours, while explicitly disallowing `Date` objects and providing a helpful error message in that case.","status":200,"tokens":[103,241],"elapsed":4.9101,"cost":0.003924,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7322,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
