Define two method signatures, one for DateTime and one for Date\n2. For DateTime, use Period types like Hour to add hours\n3. For Date, throw an error explaining the limitation","status":200,"tokens":[223,301],"elapsed":6.703276625,"cost":0.005184,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13298,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
