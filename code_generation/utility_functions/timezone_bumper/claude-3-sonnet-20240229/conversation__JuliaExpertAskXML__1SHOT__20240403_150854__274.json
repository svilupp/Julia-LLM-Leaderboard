The first method takes a `DateTime` and an optional integer `bump` (defaulting to 3). It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than the input `dt`.\n\n2. The second method is a fallback that throws an `ArgumentError` if the input is a `Date` type, since the function is designed to only work with `DateTime` objects.\n\nThe key points:\n\n- `Hour(bump)` creates a `Period` object representing `bump` hours, which can be added to a `DateTime` to get a new `DateTime`.\n- The second method uses a `throw` statement to raise an error if a `Date` is passed in, since we can't adjust the hour of a `Date`.\n- By defining two methods, we achieve the desired behavior of allowing `DateTime` inputs while rejecting `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[108,275],"elapsed":7.853313125,"cost":0.004449,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18900,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
