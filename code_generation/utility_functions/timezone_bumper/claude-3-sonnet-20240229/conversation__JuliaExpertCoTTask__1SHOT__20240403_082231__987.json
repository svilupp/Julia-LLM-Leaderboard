It also handles errors for `Date` types:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime types, not Date types\"))\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\n# For DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Using default value of 3 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt) # Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# For Date (throws an error)\nd = Date(2023, 4, 10)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(d, 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e) # Output: ArgumentError: timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime types, not Date types\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. The first `timezone_bumper` method accepts a `DateTime` and an optional `bump::Int` (defaulting to 3).\n2. It adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime` using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n3. The second `timezone_bumper` method is for `Date` types and throws an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message.\n4. The example usage demonstrates that the function works correctly for `DateTime` types, both with and without specifying the `bump` value.\n5. It also shows that an `ArgumentError` is thrown when a `Date` type is passed to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[189,467],"elapsed":9.769362083,"cost":0.007572,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23861,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
