Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime types, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and an optional `bump` of type `Int` which defaults to `3`. It returns a new `DateTime` object that is increased by `bump` hours from the input `dt`.\n\nFor the second method, if a `Date` is passed instead of a `DateTime`, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a descriptive message.\n\nTo use it:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Returns 2023-04-01T15:00:00\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # Returns 2023-04-01T17:00:00\n\nd = Date(2023, 4, 1)\ntimezone_bumper(d, 3) # Throws ArgumentError\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that you want to increase the timestamp by a fixed number of hours. If you need to handle time zones or adjust for daylight saving time, you may need to use additional functionality from the `Dates` module in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[103,335],"elapsed":6.775067917,"cost":0.005334,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11666,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
