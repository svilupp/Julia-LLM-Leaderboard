Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! You can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper function only accepts DateTime objects, not Date.\")\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper function only accepts DateTime objects.\")\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The main function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)` takes a `DateTime` object and an `Int` bump value (default = 3 hours).\n    - If the input is a `DateTime` object, it adds `bump` hours to the timestamp using `Hour(bump)` and the `+` operator, then returns the updated `DateTime`.\n\n2. The second method handles cases where a `Date` object is passed. Since the function is only designed to work with `DateTime`, it throws an error.\n\n3. The last method is a fallback to catch any other data types that may be passed in and also raises an error.\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```julia\n# This should work fine\ndt = DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 4))  # Adds 4 hours -> 2023-10-01T16:00:00\n\n# This should throw an error for Date\nd = Date(2023, 10, 1)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(d))  # Error: timezone_bumper function only accepts DateTime objects, not Date.\n```\n\nThese definitions ensure that `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` objects and behaves as expected when incorrect types are provided.","status":200,"tokens":[68,397],"elapsed":4.403322083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2040232325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
