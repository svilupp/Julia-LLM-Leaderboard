If it's a `Date`, an error is thrown.\n- **Default Behavior**: If no `bump` is provided, it defaults to +3 hours.\n- **Addition**: The `dt + Hour(bump)` increases the time by specified hours.\n- **Examples**: The given example illustrates the bumping of time by 3 hours from `12:00` to `15:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[183,335],"elapsed":3.85897725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2068283923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
