If it's not `DateTime`, throw an error.\n   - Use Julia's `Dates` library to manipulate the `DateTime`.\n   - Return the new `DateTime` after adding `bump` hours.\n\n3. **Write the function**.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument `dt` must be a DateTime object.\"))\nend\n```\n\n### Testing with provided data:\n\n```julia\n# Provided test case\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\n### Check the solution:\n\n- The function should correctly bump the time forward by `bump` hours.\n- Ensure that it throws an error when passed a `Date` object or any other type.\n\nI am confident the function meets the requirements as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[183,347],"elapsed":3.868729208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-488516832,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
