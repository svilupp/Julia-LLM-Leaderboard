Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Function Definition\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Ensure it throws an error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only supports DateTime types.\"))\nend\n\n# Example Usage\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\nprintln(bumped_time)  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: We ensure that the `timezone_bumper` function is used only with `DateTime` types. If itâ€™s used with a `Date`, an `ArgumentError` is thrown.\n- **DateTime Manipulation**: We add the necessary hours using `Dates.Hour(bump)` to `dt`.\n- **Default Behavior**: If no `bump` value is provided, it defaults to increasing the time by 3 hours.\n\n### Testing the Example:\nGiven the input `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` and a `bump` of 3, the function correctly returns `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[183,291],"elapsed":3.601768958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1671429092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
