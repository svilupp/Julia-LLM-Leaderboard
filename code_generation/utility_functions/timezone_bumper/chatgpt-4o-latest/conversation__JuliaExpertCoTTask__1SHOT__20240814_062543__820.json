The primary function `timezone_bumper` is defined to accept only `DateTime` types and increases the time by the `bump` hours with a default value of `3`.\n2. If the input is a `Date` type, it throws an `ArgumentError` indicating that the function only accepts `DateTime` types.\n3. The usage example demonstrates the function working with a `DateTime`.\n\n**Result after using the function:**\nThe given timestamp `2023-04-10T12:00:00` is increased by 3 hours making it `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[183,280],"elapsed":3.479688125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":246644932,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
