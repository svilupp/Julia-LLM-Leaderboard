Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a Julia function `timezone_bumper` that accomplishes what you described:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date; bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime objects, not Date objects.\"))\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump`, which represents the number of hours to add to the datetime.\n- The function defaults to a bump of 3 hours if no `bump` is provided.\n- `Hour(bump)` converts the integer `bump` into a `Hour` object, making it easier for us to add it directly to the provided datetime `dt`.\n- Also, there's a method that throws an error if a `Date` object (as opposed to a `DateTime` object) is passed to the function, warning the user that the function should be used only with `DateTime` objects.\n\n### Example usage:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Defaults to +3 hours\nprintln(new_dt)  # 2023-05-01T15:00:00\n\n# Custom bump value\nnew_dt_with_custom_bump = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # +5 hours\nprintln(new_dt_with_custom_bump)  # 2023-05-01T17:00:00\n\n# Attempting to use Date instead of DateTime\nd = Date(2023, 5, 1)\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # This will throw an error\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that only `DateTime` objects are accepted by the function for bumping the time, and any inappropriate usage with `Date` objects will be caught and reported clearly.","status":200,"tokens":[68,429],"elapsed":4.503766708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1069253176,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
