If `dt` is a `DateTime` type, it adds the specified `bump` (defaulting to 3 hours) to the timestamp and returns the new `DateTime`.\n2. If `dt` is a `Date` type, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that the function only supports `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[108,182],"elapsed":2.207545375,"cost":0.0002545,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17636,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
