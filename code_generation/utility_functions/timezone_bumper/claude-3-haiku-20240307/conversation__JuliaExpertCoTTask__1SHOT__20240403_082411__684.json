It returns the `DateTime` incremented by the `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour` type.\n3. **Solve the task**: We call the `timezone_bumper` function with the provided example data and store the result.\n4. **Check the solution**: We assert that the result is correct by comparing it with the expected `DateTime`. We also add a check to ensure that the function throws a `MethodError` when a `Date` type is provided, as the task specifies.\n\nThis solution follows the problem-solving steps and ensures the function works correctly for the given task and data.","status":200,"tokens":[189,403],"elapsed":4.190303375,"cost":0.0005510000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28006,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
