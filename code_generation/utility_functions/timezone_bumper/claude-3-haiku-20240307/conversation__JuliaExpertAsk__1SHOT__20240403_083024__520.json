Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function has two methods:\n\n1. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` argument (defaulting to 3 hours). It adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime` object and returns the result.\n\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object and the optional `bump` argument. It throws an `ArgumentError` because the function is only designed to work with `DateTime` types, not `Date` types.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(new_dt) # Output: 2023-04-01T15:00:00\n```\n\nAnd an example of what happens when you try to use it with a `Date` type:\n\n```julia\ndate = Date(2023, 4, 1)\nnew_date = timezone_bumper(date)\n# ERROR: ArgumentError: timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,331],"elapsed":3.09216025,"cost":0.00043950000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30611,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
