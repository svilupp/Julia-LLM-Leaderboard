It should check if the input is a `DateTime` type, and if so, add the specified number of hours to the timestamp and return the new `DateTime` object. If the input is not a `DateTime` type, it should throw an `ArgumentError`.\n\n2. **Write the function**: The `timezone_bumper` function first checks the type of the input `dt` using the `typeof` function. If it's not a `DateTime` type, it throws an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message. Otherwise, it creates a new `DateTime` object by adding the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime` using the `+` operator and the `Dates.Hour` type.\n\n3. **Solve the task**: The function is now ready to be used. The example usage at the end shows how to call the `timezone_bumper` function with the provided data.\n\n4. **Check the solution**: The provided example of `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` should return a new `DateTime` object with the time increased by 3 hours, which is `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[189,446],"elapsed":4.2189035,"cost":0.00060475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14573,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
