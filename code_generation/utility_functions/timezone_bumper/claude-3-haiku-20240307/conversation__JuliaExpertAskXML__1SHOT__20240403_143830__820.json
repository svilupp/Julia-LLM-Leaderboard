The function is defined with a type signature that accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` for the number of hours to bump (defaulting to 3).\n2. The function simply adds the desired number of hours to the `DateTime` using the `Dates.Hour` constructor.\n3. A separate method is defined that accepts a `Date` type, and it throws an `ArgumentError` with a helpful message.\n\nThis ensures the function only operates on `DateTime` types, and provides a clear error message if a `Date` type is passed.","status":200,"tokens":[108,217],"elapsed":2.744589958,"cost":0.00029825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
