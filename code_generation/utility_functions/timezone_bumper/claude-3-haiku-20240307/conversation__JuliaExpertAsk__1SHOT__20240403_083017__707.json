If not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type. If so, it returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than the input `dt`.\n\nIf the input `dt` is a `Date` type, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with the message \"Input must be a DateTime type, not a Date type.\"\n\nThis ensures that the function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[103,254],"elapsed":2.910016583,"cost":0.00034325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2588,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
