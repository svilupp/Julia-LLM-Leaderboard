Think through the approach step by step:\n   - The function should take two arguments: `dt::DateTime` and `bump::Int` (default to 3).\n   - The function should increase the provided `dt` by `bump` hours.\n   - The function should throw an error if `dt` is a `Date` type.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\n4.
