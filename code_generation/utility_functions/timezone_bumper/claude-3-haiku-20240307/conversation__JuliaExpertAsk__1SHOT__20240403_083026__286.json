If a `Date` object is provided instead, the function throws an `ArgumentError`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 7, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2023-04-07T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,227],"elapsed":2.452471709,"cost":0.00030950000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32511,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
