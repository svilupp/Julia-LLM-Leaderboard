Think through the approach step by step:\n   - The function should take a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` parameter (defaulting to 3 hours).\n   - It should check if the input is a `DateTime` type and throw an error if it's not.\n   - It should then increase the timestamp by the specified number of hours and return the updated `DateTime` object.\n\n2. Write the necessary functions:\n   - The `timezone_bumper` function is defined to take a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` parameter (defaulting to 3 hours).\n   - The function checks if the input is a `DateTime` type using the `isa` operator, and throws an `ArgumentError` if it's not.\n   - The function then increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours using the `+` operator and the `Dates.Hour` type.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function is implemented as described above.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   - The example usage `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` is provided, and the output is `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, which is correct.\n\nThe function works as expected, handling the provided `DateTime` input and increasing the timestamp by the specified number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[189,463],"elapsed":4.750067125,"cost":0.000626,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31881,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
