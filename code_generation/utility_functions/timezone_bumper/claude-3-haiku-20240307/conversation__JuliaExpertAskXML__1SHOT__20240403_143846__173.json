This argument has a default value of 3 hours.\n\nThe function checks the input type and throws an `ArgumentError` if it's a `Date` type, as requested. If the input is a `DateTime` type, it simply adds the specified number of hours using the `Hour` constructor and returns the modified `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,207],"elapsed":2.5366105,"cost":0.00028575000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
