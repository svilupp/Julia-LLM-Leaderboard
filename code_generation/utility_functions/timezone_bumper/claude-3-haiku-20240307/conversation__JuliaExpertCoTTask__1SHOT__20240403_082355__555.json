Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution following the steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))\n```\n\nStep-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**:\n   - The function should accept a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` parameter (defaulting to 3 hours).\n   - The function should add the `bump` hours to the provided `DateTime` object and return the updated `DateTime`.\n   - The function should throw an error if a `Date` type is provided instead of a `DateTime` type.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n   - Define the `timezone_bumper` function with the appropriate parameter types and default value.\n   - Use the `Dates.Hour` constructor to create the time duration to be added to the `DateTime` object.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - Add the `bump` hours to the input `DateTime` object using the `+` operator.\n   - Return the updated `DateTime` object.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n   - The provided example `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` should return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.\n\nThe solution fulfills the requirements of the task and handles the case where a `Date` type is provided by throwing an error.","status":200,"tokens":[189,373],"elapsed":3.55361875,"cost":0.0005135000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26418,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
