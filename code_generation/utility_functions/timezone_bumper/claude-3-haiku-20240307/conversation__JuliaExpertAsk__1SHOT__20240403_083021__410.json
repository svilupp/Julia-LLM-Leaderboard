It takes two arguments: `dt` (a `DateTime` object) and `bump` (an optional `Int` representing the number of hours to add, defaulting to 3).\n2. The first method definition handles `DateTime` objects and simply adds the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime`.\n3. The second method definition handles `Date` objects and throws an `ArgumentError` with a descriptive error message, since `timezone_bumper()` is not designed to work with `Date` types.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # new_dt will be 2023-04-01T15:00:00\n```\n\nAnd if you try to use a `Date` object, it will throw an error:\n\n```julia\nd = Date(2023, 4, 1)\nnew_d = timezone_bumper(d)  # throws ArgumentError\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,333],"elapsed":3.348816834,"cost":0.000442,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
