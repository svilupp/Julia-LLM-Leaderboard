The function increases the given timestamp by the number of hours specified in the `bump` argument and returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nIn the test case, we create a `DateTime` object for April 10, 2023, at 12:00 pm and call the `timezone_bumper` function with a `bump` value of 3. The function returns a new `DateTime` object that is 3 hours later, which we print for verification.","status":200,"tokens":[205,252],"elapsed":1.767376417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1431678510,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
