[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object as input and an optional integer `bump` which defaults to 3. It adds `bump` number of hours to the `DateTime` object and returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nIf a `Date` object is passed instead of a `DateTime` object, it will throw a method error because the function is not defined for `Date` objects.\n\nThe `Dates` module from the Julia Standard Library is used to handle date and time objects. The `Hour` function is used to create a `Period` object which represents a duration of time. The `+` operator is used to add this `Period` object to the `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[375,223],"elapsed":1.592333292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1590287512,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
