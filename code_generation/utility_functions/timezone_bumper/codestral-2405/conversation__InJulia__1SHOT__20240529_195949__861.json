If no `Int` value is provided, it will default to `3`. The function then adds the number of hours specified by `bump` to the input `DateTime` object.\n\nIn the test case, we first create a `DateTime` object `dt`. Then, we use `timezone_bumper` to increase `dt` by 3 hours (the default value), which is stored in `dt_bumped`. Finally, we print out both the original time and the bumped time.\n\nIf a `Date` type is passed to `timezone_bumper`, it will throw an error, as specified by the function definition.","status":200,"tokens":[66,304],"elapsed":2.11863625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-658312696,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
