Here's a simple function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an `Int` indicating the number of hours to add to `dt`. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `Date` type. If it is, it throws an error. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds `bump` hours to it and returns the new `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[66,211],"elapsed":1.528213041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":355795635,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
