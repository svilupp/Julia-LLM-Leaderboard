The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` which is a `DateTime` object, and `bump` which is an `Int` that defaults to 3 if not provided. The function returns the `DateTime` object `dt` increased by `bump` hours. If you try to call this function with a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime` object, Julia will throw an error because the function is not defined for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[66,209],"elapsed":1.448104792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1371900317,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
