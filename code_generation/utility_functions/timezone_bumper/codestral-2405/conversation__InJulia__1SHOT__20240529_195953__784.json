Date type provided.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. The `dt` argument is expected to be of type `DateTime`, while `bump` is expected to be of type `Int`. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n\nThe function adds `bump` hours to the given `DateTime` object by using the `+` operator with `Hour(bump)`. This is possible because Julia's `Dates` module defines addition and subtraction operations for `DateTime` and `Period` objects.\n\nWe also define a second `timezone_bumper` function that takes a `Date` argument and throws an error, because the function is only intended to work with `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,278],"elapsed":1.979391125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":982876340,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
