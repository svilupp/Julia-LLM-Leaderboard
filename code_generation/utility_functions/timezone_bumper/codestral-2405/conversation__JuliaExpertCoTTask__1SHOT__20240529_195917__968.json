[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

It increases the provided timestamp by `bump` hours. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to +3 hours. The function uses the Dates library to add the `bump` value as a `Dates.Hour` object to the provided `DateTime` object.\n\nThe test code at the end of the function checks that the function works correctly by calling it with a `DateTime` object and an integer value for `bump`. It then prints the result using `@show`. This allows us to see the new `DateTime` object that results from adding `bump` hours to the original `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[205,240],"elapsed":1.696488084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1610626237,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
