The function adds `bump` number of hours to the provided `DateTime` object using the `+` operator and the `Dates.Hour` constructor. This function will throw an error if a `Date` object is passed as the first argument, as specified in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[107,244],"elapsed":1.705867042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1722651339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
