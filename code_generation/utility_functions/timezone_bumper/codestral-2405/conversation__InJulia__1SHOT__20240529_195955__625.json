Please provide a DateTime object.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the Dates library, which is part of the standard library in Julia. The function `timezone_bumper` accepts any DateTime object and an integer (representing the number of hours to increment the DateTime object) as arguments. If no second argument is provided, the function will default to incrementing the DateTime object by 3 hours.\n\nThe function also contains a method that throws an error if a Date object is provided as the first argument. This is because Date objects do not have a time component, and so it doesn't make sense to increment them by a certain number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[66,229],"elapsed":1.624897209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1730034125,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
