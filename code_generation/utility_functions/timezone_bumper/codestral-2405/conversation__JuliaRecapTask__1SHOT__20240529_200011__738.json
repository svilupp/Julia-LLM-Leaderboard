[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's the Julia function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours. This function will only work for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        error(\"Input must be of DateTime type.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nWe can test the function with some examples:\n\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n2022-01-01T12:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2022-01-01T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n2022-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nThe function works as expected. It increases the provided DateTime object by the given number of hours. If no number of hours is specified, it defaults to 3 hours. If a Date object is passed, the function throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[373,319],"elapsed":2.234275791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-768311536,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
