[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The function adds `bump` hours to the DateTime object `dt` and returns the new DateTime object. If `bump` is not provided, the function defaults to adding 3 hours. If the function is called with a Date object instead of a DateTime object, it throws an error.\n\nWe then test the function with a DateTime object and print the resulting DateTime object. We also test the function with a different value for `bump`. Finally, we try to call the function with a Date object to demonstrate that it throws an error in this case.","status":200,"tokens":[373,325],"elapsed":2.325465125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1344564419,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
