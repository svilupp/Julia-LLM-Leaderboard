If `bump` is not provided, the function defaults to adding 3 hours. If the input `dt` is not of DateTime type, the function will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[66,185],"elapsed":1.292103125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-777989421,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
