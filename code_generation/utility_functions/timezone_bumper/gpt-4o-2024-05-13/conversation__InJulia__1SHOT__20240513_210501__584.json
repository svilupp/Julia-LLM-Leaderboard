Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is the Julia code for the `timezone_bumper` function. This function will increase the provided timestamp by a specified number of hours, defaulting to 3 hours if not provided. It ensures that it only works for `DateTime` types and throws an error if a `Date` type is provided.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\nend\n```\n\nHere is how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Correct usage with DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 10, 5, 13, 0, 0)  # Oct 5, 2023, 13:00:00\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)           # Increases by 3 hours by default\nprintln(new_dt)  # Prints: 2023-10-05T16:00:00\n\n# Usage with custom bump\nnew_dt_custom = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Increases by 5 hours\nprintln(new_dt_custom)  # Prints: 2023-10-05T18:00:00\n\n# Incorrect usage with Date (should throw an error)\nd = Date(2023, 10, 5)\ntry\n    new_d = timezone_bumper(d)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Prints: ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis should cover the functionality you're looking for. The `timezone_bumper` increments the `DateTime` by the specified hours, and it ensures type correctness by throwing an `ArgumentError` when a `Date` object is passed instead.","status":200,"tokens":[68,400],"elapsed":4.473429667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1471657628,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
