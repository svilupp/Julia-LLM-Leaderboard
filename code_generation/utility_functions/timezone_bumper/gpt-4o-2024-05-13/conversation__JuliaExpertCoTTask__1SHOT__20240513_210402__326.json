Please provide a DateTime object.\"))\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndt_example = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump_hours = 3\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt_example, bump_hours)\nprintln(new_dt)  # Should print 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThis function checks the type of the input and handles errors as specified. Let's verify it against the given example.\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided data\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend # Should throw an error\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3) # Should return DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```\n\nThe function should perform correctly, and tests will produce the expected outputs.","status":200,"tokens":[183,449],"elapsed":4.107730208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2124296191,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
