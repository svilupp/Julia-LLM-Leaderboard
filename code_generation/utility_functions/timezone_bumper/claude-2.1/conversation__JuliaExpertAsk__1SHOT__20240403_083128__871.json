By specifying the type in the method definition, Julia will dispatch appropriately based on the type of the input `dt`.\n\n- For the `DateTime` method, I simply add the `bump` number of hours by constructing a `Hour` period with that value and adding it.\n\n- For the `Date` method, I throw an `ArgumentError` to let the caller know this function doesn't support `Date` inputs.\n\n- I set the default `bump` value to 3 hours to match the question's requested behavior.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[104,252],"elapsed":13.110158208,"cost":0.006880000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25738,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
