And by throwing an exception on `Date`, it prevents silently ignoring invalid inputs.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[104,218],"elapsed":10.203601833,"cost":0.006064000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
