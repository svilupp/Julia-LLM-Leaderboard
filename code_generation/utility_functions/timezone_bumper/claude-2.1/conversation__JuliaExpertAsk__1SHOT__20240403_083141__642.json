No need to check types in the function.\n\n- I used an `Hour` type instead of just multiplying by hours to make it more robust in case of DST changes.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[104,235],"elapsed":13.121330291,"cost":0.006472,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24570,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
