By specifying the types, Julia will dispatch to the correct method based on the type of the first argument.\n\n- For the DateTime method, I simply add the number of hours (converted to a Duration with `Hour(bump)`) to the given DateTime.\n\n- For the Date method, I throw an ArgumentError explaining that this function only works with DateTime.\n\n- I set the default bump value to 3 hours.\n\nSo this allows the user to easily shift a DateTime by a number of hours, but will error cleanly if they accidentally pass a Date instead of a DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[104,242],"elapsed":11.753211458,"cost":0.00664,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
