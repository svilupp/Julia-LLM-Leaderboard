By specifying the types, it will dispatch to the correct method based on the type of the first argument.\n\n- For the DateTime method, it just returns the passed DateTime plus a Duration created from the bump hours. \n\n- For the Date method, it just throws an ArgumentError with an explanatory message.\n\n- The DateTime method has a default bump of 3 hours. So if no second argument is passed, it will bump by 3 hours.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[104,225],"elapsed":11.391259,"cost":0.0062320000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12725,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
