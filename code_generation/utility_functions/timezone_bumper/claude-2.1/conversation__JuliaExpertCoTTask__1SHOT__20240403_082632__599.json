When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It returns a new `DateTime` by adding `bump` hours to the input `dt`.\n\nSome key points:\n\n- I restrict the input `dt` to be a `DateTime` by specifying `::DateTime`. This ensures it will error if a `Date` is passed in.\n- I use the `Hour` type from Dates package to add the bump cleanly to the DateTime.\n- I test it works on the provided example input.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples you'd like me to test!","status":200,"tokens":[189,212],"elapsed":11.245706959,"cost":0.0066,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29273,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
