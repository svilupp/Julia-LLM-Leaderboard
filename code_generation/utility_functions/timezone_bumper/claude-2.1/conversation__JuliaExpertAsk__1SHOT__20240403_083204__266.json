Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that increases a DateTime by a given number of hours, and throws an error if given a Date instead of a DateTime:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime\"))\nend\n```\n\nTo explain further:\n\n- I define two methods - one for `DateTime` and one for `Date` to handle the two types separately. \n\n- For the `DateTime` method, I simply add the `bump` number of hours by creating a `Hour` period of length `bump` and adding it.\n\n- For the `Date` method, I throw an `ArgumentError` to indicate that this function doesn't support `Date` types.\n\nBy dispatching on the types, it will automatically call the right method for the type passed in. And throwing the error enforces the requirement to only allow `DateTime`.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[104,244],"elapsed":11.04397,"cost":0.006688,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16784,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
