When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If the input is a DateTime, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours. If the input is a Date, it throws an error because Date types are not supported. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis will return a DateTime object that is 3 hours later than the input.","status":200,"tokens":[212,227],"elapsed":10.315339917,"cost":9.324000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-140083055,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
