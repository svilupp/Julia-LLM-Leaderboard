If it is, we add `bump` hours to it using the `+` operator and return the result. If `dt` is a `Date` type, we throw an `ArgumentError`.\n\nThe second function definition is for the case where `dt` is a `Date` type. It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `Date` type is not supported.\n\nThe `println` statement at the end is a test of the function. It should print `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[212,287],"elapsed":12.306571375,"cost":0.00011004000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1518447746,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
