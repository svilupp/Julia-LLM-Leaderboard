Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to work with dates and times. Here is a function that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported. Please provide a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a DateTime or Date type and `bump` which is an integer representing the number of hours to add (default is 3). If `dt` is a DateTime type, it adds `bump` hours to it and returns the result. If `dt` is a Date type, it throws an error because Date types are not supported.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0), 5)\n2022-01-01T17:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2022, 1, 1))\nERROR: ArgumentError: Date type is not supported. Please provide a DateTime type.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[73,329],"elapsed":17.337961875,"cost":0.00010234,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-762534364,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
