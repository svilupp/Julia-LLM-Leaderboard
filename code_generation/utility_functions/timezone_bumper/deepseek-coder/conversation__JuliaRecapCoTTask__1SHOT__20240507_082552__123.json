[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please provide a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Dates` package in Julia to handle date and time operations. The `timezone_bumper` function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` as arguments. If the input is a `DateTime`, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours (default is 3 hours). If the input is a `Date`, it throws an error because `Date` types are not supported.\n\nPlease note that the `timezone_bumper` function is overloaded for `DateTime` and `Date` types. The function with `DateTime` type is the main function that performs the operation, and the function with `Date` type throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[402,245],"elapsed":14.401068584,"cost":0.00012488,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1301014914,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
