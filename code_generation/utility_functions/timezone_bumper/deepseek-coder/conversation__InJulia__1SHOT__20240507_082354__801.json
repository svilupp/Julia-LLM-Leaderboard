Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to work with dates and times. Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date type is not supported. Please provide a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` which is the date/time to be bumped, and `bump` which is the number of hours to bump the time by (defaults to 3).\n\nThe first method of `timezone_bumper` is for `DateTime` types. It simply adds the specified number of hours to the provided date/time.\n\nThe second method of `timezone_bumper` is for `Date` types. It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `Date` types are not supported.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0), 5)\n2022-01-01T17:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2022, 1, 1), 5)\nERROR: ArgumentError: Date type is not supported. Please provide a DateTime type.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[73,375],"elapsed":16.477132209,"cost":0.00011522,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1254358213,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
