If `dt` is a `Date` type, we throw an error because `Date` types do not support timezone bumping.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis will return a `DateTime` object that is 3 hours later than the input `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[212,243],"elapsed":13.397156625,"cost":9.772e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1639310049,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
