If not, throw an error.\n   - If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, add `bump` hours to it.\n   - Return the new `DateTime`.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is now defined and ready to use.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\n@show timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\nThis should return `\"2023-04-10T15:00:00\"`. If it does, then the function is working correctly. If not, then there's a mistake somewhere in the function that needs to be fixed.\n\nAlso, let's test the function with a `Date` type to check if it throws an error:\n\n```julia\n@show timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\n```\n\nThis should throw an error saying \"Input must be of type DateTime\". If it does, then the error handling in the function is working correctly. If not, then there's a mistake somewhere in the error handling that needs to be fixed.","status":200,"tokens":[205,461],"elapsed":10.6007235,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1494893829,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
