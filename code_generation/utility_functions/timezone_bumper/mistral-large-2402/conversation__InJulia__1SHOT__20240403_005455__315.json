Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two methods for the function `timezone_bumper`. The first method accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` argument, which defaults to 3 if not provided. It returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than the input `DateTime`.\n\nThe second method accepts a `Date` object and an optional `bump` argument. This method doesn't perform any time bumping. Instead, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message explaining that the function only works for `DateTime` types, not `Date` types.\n\nThis way, if you try to call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` object, you'll get an informative error message.","status":200,"tokens":[66,277],"elapsed":6.752279333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1538987357,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
