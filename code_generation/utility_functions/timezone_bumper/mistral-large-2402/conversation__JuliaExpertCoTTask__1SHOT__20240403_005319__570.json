Here's how I would approach this task:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`.\n   - Check if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, throw an error.\n   - If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, add `bump` hours to it.\n   - Return the new `DateTime`.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is now defined and ready to use.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\n@show timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\nThis should output: `\"2023-04-10T15:00:00\"` which is the expected result. The function should also throw an error if a `Date` type is provided instead of a `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[205,362],"elapsed":8.646331333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-823023170,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
