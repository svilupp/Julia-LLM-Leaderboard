Here's a simple and concise way to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if isinstance(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Function only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input is a `Date` type, and if so, it throws an error. If the input is a `DateTime` type, it adds the specified number of hours (default is 3 if `bump` is not provided) to the datetime object.\n\nYou can call this function with your provided data like this:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\nThis will return a new `DateTime` object that is 3 hours ahead of the input time.","status":200,"tokens":[205,242],"elapsed":6.267023375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":43220000,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
