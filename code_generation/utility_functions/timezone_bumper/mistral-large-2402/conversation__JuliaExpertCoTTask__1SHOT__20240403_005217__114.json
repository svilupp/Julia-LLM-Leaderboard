[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

If it's not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. If it is, it adds the specified number of hours (default is 3) to the `DateTime` object and returns the new `DateTime`. The `try/catch` block is used to handle any potential errors that might occur during the function call.","status":200,"tokens":[205,233],"elapsed":5.764428334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1322494197,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
