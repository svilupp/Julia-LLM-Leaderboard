Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write that function in Julia. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two methods for the function `timezone_bumper`. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`, and it returns a new `DateTime` object that is `bump` hours later than the input. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3.\n\nThe second method takes a `Date` object and an integer `bump`. However, instead of performing any calculation, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message explaining that the function only works for `DateTime` types.\n\nThis way, if you try to call `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` object, you'll get a clear error message explaining the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[66,262],"elapsed":6.131715542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-922054508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
