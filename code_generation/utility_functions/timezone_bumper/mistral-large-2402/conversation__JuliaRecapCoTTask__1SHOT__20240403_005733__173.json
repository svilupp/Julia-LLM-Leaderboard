[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that does exactly that. It throws an error if the provided type is `Date` instead of `DateTime`.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (Date, Int)))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We import the `Dates` standard library.\n- We define the `timezone_bumper` function with two methods. Julia's multiple dispatch feature allows us to define different behaviors for different types.\n- The first method accepts a `DateTime` and an `Int` (with a default value of 3). It returns a new `DateTime` that is `bump` hours later than the input `DateTime`.\n- The second method accepts a `Date` and an `Int`. It throws a `MethodError` to indicate that this function does not support `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[375,279],"elapsed":7.542276125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1031576709,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
