If not, throw an error.\n   - If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, add `bump` hours to it.\n   - Return the new `DateTime`.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is now defined and ready to use.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\n@test timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```\n\nThis test should pass, indicating that the function works as expected. If the `@test` macro is not available, you can manually check the output of the function call against the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[205,365],"elapsed":8.357546125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1927118935,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
