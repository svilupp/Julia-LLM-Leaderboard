It checks if the input is a DateTime type, and if it's not, it throws an error. If it is, it adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime.\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime, not \", typeof(dt)))\n    end\n    return timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the first function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` is a method that specifically handles DateTime types and adds the specified number of hours. The second function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)` is a more general method that checks the type of the input and throws an error if it's not a DateTime. It then calls the first method if the input is a DateTime.\n\nThis way, you can call `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` with any input, and it will either throw an error or add the specified number of hours to the DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[66,302],"elapsed":6.945970292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1132292674,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
