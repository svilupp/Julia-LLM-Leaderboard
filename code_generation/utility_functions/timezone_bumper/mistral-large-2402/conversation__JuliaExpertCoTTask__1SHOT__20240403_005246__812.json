Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`.\n   - Check if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, throw an error.\n   - If `dt` is a `DateTime`, add `bump` hours to it.\n   - Return the new `DateTime`.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is now defined and ready to use.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\n```julia\n# Test with provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # This should print: \"2023-04-10T15:00:00\"\n\n# Test with Date type to check error handling\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\ncatch e\n    println(\"Error: \", e)  # This should print: \"Error: ArgumentError: Input must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function should now work as expected, adding the specified number of hours to a given `DateTime` and throwing an error if given a `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[205,424],"elapsed":11.371068542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":323278023,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
