The first method accepts a `DateTime` and an optional `bump` argument, which defaults to 3 if not provided. It returns a new `DateTime` that is `bump` hours later than the input `DateTime`.\n\nThe second method accepts a `Date` and throws a `MethodError` if it's called, indicating that the function doesn't support `Date` types. This is to ensure that the function only works with `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[107,210],"elapsed":9.962404542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2067761418,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
