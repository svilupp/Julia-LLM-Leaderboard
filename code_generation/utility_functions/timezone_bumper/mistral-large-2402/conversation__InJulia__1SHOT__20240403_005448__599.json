This function checks if the input is a DateTime type, and if it is, it adds the specified number of hours to it. If the input is not a DateTime type, it throws an error.\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime, not \", typeof(dt)))\n    end\n    return timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn the first function, we define the behavior for when the input is a DateTime type. In the second function, we check the type of the input and throw an error if it's not a DateTime. This second function calls the first function if the input is of the correct type.\n\nPlease note that you need to import the `Dates` module to use the `DateTime`, `Hour` types and the `throw` function. If it's not imported yet, you can do it by adding `using Dates` at the beginning of your script.","status":200,"tokens":[66,283],"elapsed":6.465103834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-523933336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
