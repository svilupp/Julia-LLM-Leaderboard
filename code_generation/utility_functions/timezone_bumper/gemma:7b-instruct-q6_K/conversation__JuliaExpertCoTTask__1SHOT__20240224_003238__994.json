If not, throw an error.\n  - Add `hours(bump)` to the `dt` object.\n- **Step 3: Solve the task:**\n  - Call the `timezone_bumper` function with the desired timestamp and bump hours.\n- **Step 4: Check that your solution is correct:**\n  - Print the result of the function call to verify that the timestamp has been increased by the specified number of hours.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDateTime(2023-04-10 15:00:00)\n```\n\nThis indicates that the timestamp `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` has been increased by 3 hours, resulting in `DateTime(2023-04-10, 15:00:00)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":27.8006365,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":7050,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
