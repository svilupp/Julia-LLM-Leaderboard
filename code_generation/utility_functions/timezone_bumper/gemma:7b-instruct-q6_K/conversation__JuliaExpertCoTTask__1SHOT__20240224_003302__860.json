If not, it throws an error.\n   - It adds `hours(bump)` to the timestamp `dt`.\n\n- **Step 2: Write functions and code:**\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is defined with the required parameters.\n\n- **Step 3: Solve the task:**\n   - The function calculates the new timestamp by adding `hours(bump)` to the original timestamp.\n\n- **Step 4: Check solution:**\n   - A sample timestamp is created and used to call the function.\n   - The output is printed to verify the functionality.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDateTime(2023-04-10 15:0:0)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `hours` function is used to add hours to a timestamp.\n- The function only works with `DateTime` objects, not `Date` objects.\n- If the `bump` parameter is not provided, the default value of 3 hours is used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":23.563605834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":541,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
