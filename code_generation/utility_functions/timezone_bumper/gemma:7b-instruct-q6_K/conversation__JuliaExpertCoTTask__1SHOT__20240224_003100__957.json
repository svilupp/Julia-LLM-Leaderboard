If it is, it adds `hours(bump)` to the timestamp.\n   - If `dt` is not a `DateTime` object, an error is thrown.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - The function is tested with an example timestamp and the output is verified.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDateTime(2023-04-10 15:0:0)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `hours` function is used to add hours to a `DateTime` object.\n- The `Date` type is not supported by this function as it does not have time components.\n- The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":23.189170709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-26652,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
