[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n  if isa(dt, DateTime)\n    dt + hours(bump)\n  else\n    error(\"timezone_bumper can only be used with DateTime objects\")\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Recall Julia snippets:** The code uses the `DateTime` type and `hours` function.\n* **Solve the task:** The function takes a timestamp `dt` and an optional `bump` parameter. It increases the hours of the timestamp by `bump` and returns a new timestamp object.\n* **Double-check:** The code checks if the input object is a `DateTime` object. If it is not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds `hours(bump)` to the timestamp object.\n\n**Special Instructions:**\n\nThe code does not currently implement any special instructions. If the user provides any special instructions, they will be prioritized over the above guidelines.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 10, 0)\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 3)  # Output: 2023-04-01 13:00:00\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis function only supports the `DateTime` type. It does not support the `Date` type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":27.966147375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-17588,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
