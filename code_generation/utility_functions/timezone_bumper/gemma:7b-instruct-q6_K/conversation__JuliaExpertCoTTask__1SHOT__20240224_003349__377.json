[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n  if isdate(dt)\n    throw(\"Error: timezone_bumper can only be used with DateTime objects\")\n  elseif isdatetime(dt)\n    return dt + hours(bump)\n  else\n    throw(\"Error: invalid input type\")\n  end\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an optional Int representing the number of hours to increase).\n- It first checks if `dt` is a Date or DateTime object. If it's a Date object, it throws an error as the function only works with DateTime objects.\n- If `dt` is a DateTime object, it adds `hours(bump)` to the DateTime object.\n- The function returns the updated DateTime object.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDateTime(2023-04-10 15:00:00)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `hours` function is used to convert the number of hours into a duration.\n- The `isdate` and `isdatetime` functions are used to check if `dt` is a Date or DateTime object, respectively.\n- The function throws an error if the input is invalid.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":23.196013958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-11216,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
