[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If it is not, it throws an error.\n   - If `dt` is a `DateTime` object, it adds `hours(bump)` to the timestamp.\n* **Double-check:**\n   - Ensure the solution correctly increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours.\n   - Check for any errors or unexpected behavior.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The function assumes that the `hours` function is defined in the `DateTime` library.\n* The function does not handle time zones. It only modifies the hour component of the timestamp.\n* The function can be used as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 10:0)\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 3)  # Output: 2023-04-01 13:0\n```\n\n**Special instructions:**\n\nIf any special instructions are provided, they will be prioritized over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":33.948978916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":22973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
