[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Think through your approach:**\n\n- The function needs to increase a timestamp by a specified number of hours.\n- It should work only for DateTime objects and throw an error for Date objects.\n\n**2. Write any functions and other code:**\n\n- The function `timezone_bumper` is defined with two parameters: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an optional Int).\n\n**3. Solve the task:**\n\n- The function checks if `dt` is a DateTime object. If it is not, it throws an error.\n- If `dt` is a DateTime object, it adds `Hours(bump)` to the timestamp.\n\n**4. Check that your solution is correct:**\n\n- The function is tested with an example input and output. The output is expected to be a DateTime object with the specified number of hours increased from the input object.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nDateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `Hours` module is used to add hours to a DateTime object.\n- The `isa` function is used to check if `dt` is a DateTime object.\n- An `ArgumentError` is thrown if `dt` is not a DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":24.122625375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-32409,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
