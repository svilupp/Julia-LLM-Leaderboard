Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this in Julia by creating a function that checks the type of the input, adjusts the DateTime by a specified number of hours using the `Dates` module, and throws an error if the input is not a DateTime type. Hereâ€™s how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This will cause an error if called with a Date type\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation provides two methods for `timezone_bumper`. One is for handling `DateTime` types and the other throws an error for `Date` types, ensuring type safety. The default value of `bump` is set to 3, but can be changed by specifying another integer when calling the function. The `Hour()` function from the `Dates` module is used to increase the hours.","status":200,"tokens":[102,212],"elapsed":6.280516792,"cost":0.00738,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2029418454,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
