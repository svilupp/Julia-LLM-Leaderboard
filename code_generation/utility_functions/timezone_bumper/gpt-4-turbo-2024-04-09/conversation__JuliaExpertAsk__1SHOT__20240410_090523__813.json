The first one accepts a `DateTime` and an optional integer `bump`, which defaults to 3. It adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime. The second function is specifically for handling cases where a `Date` is passed instead, and this will throw an error, ensuring the function enforces the type requirement by only processing `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[102,155],"elapsed":4.978936041,"cost":0.0056700000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":798054945,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
