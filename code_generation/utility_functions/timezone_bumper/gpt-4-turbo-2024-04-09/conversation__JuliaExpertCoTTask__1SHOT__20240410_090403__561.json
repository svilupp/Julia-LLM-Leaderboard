By default, this adjustment should be `+3 hours`.\n   - If the function is mistakenly applied on a `Date` type instead of a `DateTime`, it should raise an error.\n\n2. **Define the Function**:\n   - Start by defining the function `timezone_bumper` with parameters `dt` and an optional `bump` which defaults to 3.\n   - Check the type of `dt`. If it is not a `DateTime`, throw a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Implement Time Adjustment**:\n   - Use Julia's functionality to add hours to the `DateTime`.\n   - The `Dates` module in Julia provides methods like `Dates.Hour()` to manipulate date-time objects.\n\n4. **Validate Function with Examples**:\n   - Test cases will be conducted to ensure function adjusts time correctly and raises errors when misused.\n\nThis clear, step-by-step approach should help in developing a robust function. Here is the Julia function based on this plan:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(TypeError(\"timezone_bumper function expects a DateTime, not a Date\"))\nend\n```\n\n### Testing the Implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Normal Case\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Default Bump Case\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Applying function on Date type should error\nprintln(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))  # Expected to throw a TypeError\n```\n\nThe function correctly implements the specified behavior for `DateTime` objects and raises an error for `Date` objects, all while providing easily readable error messages for misuse.","status":200,"tokens":[181,477],"elapsed":11.887983,"cost":0.01612,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1048340340,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
