Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Plan\n\n1. I will define a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)` that accepts two parameters: `dt` (a `DateTime` object) and `bump` (an integer representing the number of hours to shift the datetime, with a default value of 3).\n2. I will ensure that the function checks the type of `dt`. If `dt` is not of type `DateTime`, the function will throw an error.\n3. If the type is correct, I will use `Dates` functionality in Julia to increase the `DateTime` by the specified number of hours.\n4. Return the modified `DateTime`.\n\nLet's write the function.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Providing a fallback that throws an error for unsupported types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"Unsupported type Date. Only DateTime type is supported.\")\nend\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ndt_example = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)  # April 10, 2023, at 12:00\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt_example, 3)\nprintln(bumped_time)  # Should print: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Default bump check\ndefault_bumped_time = timezone_bumper(dt_example)\nprintln(default_bumped_time)  # Should print: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Error handling check for Date type\ntry\n    dt_date = Date(2023, 4, 10)\n    timezone_bumper(dt_date)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expect error message about unsupported type\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that `timezone_bumper` behaves as specified, adding hours to `DateTime` objects and providing clear errors for unsupported `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[181,424],"elapsed":11.220353667,"cost":0.014530000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1899078,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
