Specifically, we will:\n\n1. Verify the type of the input `dt`.\n2. Add the required number of hours to the `DateTime` object using appropriate `DateTime` functions.\n3. Handle the default bump value by setting a default parameter.\n4. Generate an error if the input is not of type `DateTime`.\n\nLet's go ahead and implement these steps.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# To raise an error for Date types explicitly\n# Annotate the type in the function argument itself restricts other types implicitly\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"Invalid input type. Requires a DateTime, received a Date.\")\nend\n\n# Test cases\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))  # 2023-04-10T15:00:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))   # 2023-04-10T15:00:00, using default bump\n\n# This will raise an error\n# println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))\n\n# Check behavior of non-standard datatypes, expected to throw an error\n# println(timezone_bumper(\"2023-04-10T12:00:00\", 3)) # String input will not match any method definition\n```\n\nIn this script, two versions of the `timezone_bumper` function are implemented: one for `DateTime`, which handles the intended functionality, and one for `Date`, which raises an error specifically. The system will decide which function to use based on the type of the first argument. Adding or requiring explicit methods for types that should not be used can help catch errors early, keeping usage clear and to the point. This solution also incorporates handling bump argument defaults and error management.","status":200,"tokens":[181,445],"elapsed":12.997302084,"cost":0.015160000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-507797922,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
