[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the solution will involve the use of the `DateTime` and related functions from the `Dates` module, which provide robust functionality to handle timestamps.\n\nThe steps to build the function:\n1. The function will accept a `DateTime` object and an integer as input. The integer will represent the number of hours we want to increment the timestamp by. The default bump will be set to 3 hours.\n2. We will make sure the function throws an error when a `Date` type, or any inappropriate type, is used.\n3. The function leverages the `+` operation with `Hour()` from the `Dates` module to add the required hours to the input `DateTime`.\n\nHere's the structure of the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    error(\"Invalid input type: Expected DateTime, got Date\")\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines two methods for `timezone_bumper`. The first method handles the correct type, `DateTime`, adding a specified number of hours (default is 3). The second accepts the `Date` type and raises an error, as required by the problem statement to handle wrong input types specifically.","status":200,"tokens":[325,268],"elapsed":6.953605791,"cost":0.011290000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2036122010,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
