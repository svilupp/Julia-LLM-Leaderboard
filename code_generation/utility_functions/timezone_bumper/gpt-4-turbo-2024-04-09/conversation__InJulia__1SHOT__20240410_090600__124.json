Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `DateTime` type from the `Dates` module to manipulate datetime objects. To meet your requirements, we can write a function `timezone_bumper` that accepts a `DateTime` object and an integer representing the number of hours to add, which defaults to 3 hours. The function will check the type of the argument `dt` to ensure it's a `DateTime`. If it receives a `Date` type instead, it will throw a custom error.\n\nHere's how you can define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function expects a DateTime, not a Date\"))\nend\n\n# Examples of usage:\ndt_example = DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 12)  # October 1st, 2023, at 12:00\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt_example)  # Default bump of 3 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Should print 2023-10-01T15:00:00\n\n# Passing a Date object should raise an error\ndate_example = Date(2023, 10, 1)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(date_example)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Defining the function**: The `timezone_bumper` function is overloaded:\n   - The first variant takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` (defaulting to 3). It returns the `DateTime` that results from adding the specified number of hours to `dt`.\n   - The second variant takes a `Date` object, which isn't desired according to your requirements. Hence, it throws an `ArgumentError` explicitly stating the incompatibility.\n\n2. **Usage**: This code contains examples of how to use the `timezone_bumper`. It demonstrates the default behavior with a `DateTime` and shows error handling when a `Date` object is passed.\n\n3. **Handling Defaults and Errors**: By throwing an error for `Date` inputs, the function enforces that it only operates on `DateTime` objects, adhering to the specified requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the behavior of your function is clear and predictable, supporting maintainability and usability in broader codebases.","status":200,"tokens":[67,502],"elapsed":13.140609,"cost":0.01573,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":466123312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
