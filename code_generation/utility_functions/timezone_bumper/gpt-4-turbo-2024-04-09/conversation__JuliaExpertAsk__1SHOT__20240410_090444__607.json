The first function signature accepts a `DateTime` type and an integer `bump`, defaulting to 3 hours if not provided. It adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime`.\n2. The second function signature explicitly handles input of type `Date` and throws an error informing the user that a `DateTime` is required, not just a `Date`.\n\nHere's an example of how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Correct usage with DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)  # Jan 1, 2023, 12:00\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Bumps by 5 hours\nprintln(new_dt)  # Outputs: 2023-01-01T17:00:00\n\n# Handling of Date input\nd = Date(2023, 1, 1)\ntry\n    new_d = timezone_bumper(d, 5)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[102,320],"elapsed":8.1639555,"cost":0.010620000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1536226685,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
