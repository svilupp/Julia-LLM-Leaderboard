This function accepts a datetime (`dt`) and an integer (`bump`), and it defaults to shifting the time by 3 hours if no bump value is provided.

An additional definition for the `Date` type throws an error, maintaining strict type handling as per the requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[102,169],"elapsed":5.614946208,"cost":0.00609,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1716517607,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
