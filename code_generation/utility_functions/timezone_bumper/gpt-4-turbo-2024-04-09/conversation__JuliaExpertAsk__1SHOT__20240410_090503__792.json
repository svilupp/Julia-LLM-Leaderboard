Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function named `timezone_bumper` that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This helps to ensure that calling the function with a Date type results in an error\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Invalid argument type: Expected DateTime, got Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function explicitly defines two methods:\n1. The first accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional integer bump (`bump` defaults to 3 if not provided). It increases the `DateTime` by the specified number of hours.\n2. The second method is a safeguard that raises an error if a `Date` object is passed instead of a `DateTime`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\n# Correct usage\ndt = DateTime(2020, 5, 1, 12)  # May 1, 2020, 12:00 pm\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)  # Increases by 2 hours -> May 1, 2020, 14:00 pm\n\n# Error for Date type\ndate = Date(2020, 5, 1)\nnew_date = timezone_bumper(date)  # This will raise an error\n```\n\nWhen you call `timezone_bumper` with a `DateTime`, it operates as expected. If called with a `Date`, it raises an appropriate `ArgumentError` indicating the type misuse.","status":200,"tokens":[102,326],"elapsed":7.531042084,"cost":0.0108,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":241272394,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
