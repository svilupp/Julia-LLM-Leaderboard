If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, we will increment it by `bump` hours. If `dt` is not a `DateTime` (like a `Date` object), we will throw an error.\n\n2. **Write the Function**:\n    - Implement error checking to differentiate between `DateTime` and `Date`.\n    - Use `Dates` module functionalities in Julia, particularly `Dates.Hour()` to manage the addition of hours to a `DateTime` object.\n\n3. **Solve the Task**:\n    - Use simple examples to ensure the function is working as expected.\n\n4. **Check the solution**:\n    - Validate with various inputs including edge cases like minimum or maximum hours in a day.\n\nWe'll start coding the above approach for the `timezone_bumper` function.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt; bump::Int=3)\n    # Step 1: Type checking\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument is not a DateTime object\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Step 2: Increment by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\n# Correct usage with DateTime object\ndatetime_example = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(datetime_example, bump=3))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Error check with Date object\ndate_example = Date(2023, 4, 10)\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(date_example, bump=3))\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```\n\nThis code is implemented in Julia and defines the function that correctly handles the addition of hours to a `DateTime` object and throws an error if a `Date` object is provided. The testing section verifies that both the correct usage and error handling work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[181,466],"elapsed":12.982741125,"cost":0.015790000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-893728168,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
