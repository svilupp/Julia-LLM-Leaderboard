Think through the approach:\n   - Check if the incoming object `dt` is a `DateTime` and not a `Date`, if incorrect type, raise an appropriate error.\n   - Add the specified number of hours (from `bump`) to the `DateTime` object.\n\n2. Code the function:\n   - Import necessary modules (`Dates` for DateTime manipulation).\n   - Define the function `timezone_bumper` with appropriate type checks.\n   - Add hours to the `DateTime` object using the `Dates` module functions.\n\n3. Check that the solution is correct:\n   - Create test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior for both correct and incorrect inputs.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# We also define behavior for Date inputs explicitly to throw an error\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date\"))\nend\n\n# Testing the function with DateTime\ntest_datetime = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(test_datetime, 3))  # Expected to be DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n\n# Attempting with a Date should throw an error\ntest_date = Date(2023, 4, 10)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(test_date, 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Check error printing\nend\n```\n\nThis solution provides detailed behavior management for the input type and comprehensively addresses the increase in hours as described. The error handling for a misidentified type (`Date` instead of `DateTime`) ensures clarity on function usage.","status":200,"tokens":[181,381],"elapsed":10.216880834,"cost":0.013240000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1440027790,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
