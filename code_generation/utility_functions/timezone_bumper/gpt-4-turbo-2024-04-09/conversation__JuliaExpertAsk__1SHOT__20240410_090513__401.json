The first definition of `timezone_bumper` accepts a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`, which defaults to 3 if not specified. It adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime`. The second function definition catches cases where a `Date` object is used instead and throws an error, indicating these cases are not handled by design.","status":200,"tokens":[102,160],"elapsed":4.006923875,"cost":0.0058200000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2119850421,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
