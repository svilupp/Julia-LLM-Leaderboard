If it's a `Date` throw an appropriate error.\n\n2. **Bump Calculation**: Use the `Dates` module functions to add `bump` hours to the `DateTime` object.\n\n3. **Return Updated DateTime**: Return the new `DateTime` after adding the specified hours.\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\n## Verification with Example\n\n```julia\n# Original DateTime\noriginal_datetime = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\n\n# Apply bump of 3 hours\nnew_datetime = timezone_bumper(original_datetime, 3)\nprintln(\"New DateTime after 3 hour bump: \", new_datetime)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nNew DateTime after 3 hour bump: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThis function should successfully bump the `DateTime` object by the intended hours, and an exception should be raised if a `Date` object is passed in.","status":200,"tokens":[181,283],"elapsed":10.960661042,"cost":0.010300000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":675826605,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
