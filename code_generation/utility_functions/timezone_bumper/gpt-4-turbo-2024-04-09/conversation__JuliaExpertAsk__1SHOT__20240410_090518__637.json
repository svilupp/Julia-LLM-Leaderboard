The operation adds a specified number of hours (defaulting to 3) to a `DateTime` object. If called with a `Date` type, the function will explicitly throw an error, notifying the user to provide a `DateTime` type instead.","status":200,"tokens":[102,138],"elapsed":4.872505916,"cost":0.0051600000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1240040354,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
