If `dt` is of type `Date`, throw an error.\n2. **Add Hour Bump**: If the type is valid, add the specified number of hours (`bump` hours) to the `DateTime`.\n3. **Return New DateTime**: After adjusting the hours, return the modified `DateTime` object.\n\n## Function Writing and Problem Solving\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overload to raise an error if the input is of type Date\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input should be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\n## Example Test\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))  # Expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))    # Default bump, expected output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n# println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))          # This should raise an error.\n\n```\n\n## Check Solution\n\nBy running the examples given, you can verify that the function correctly increases the hours for a `DateTime` and that it throws an error when given a `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,349],"elapsed":8.170720125,"cost":0.012280000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2069142561,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
