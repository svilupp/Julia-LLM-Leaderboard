Takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump`, where `bump` signifies the number of hours to add to the timestamp.\n2. The function will check if `dt` is a `DateTime` type and not a `Date` type. If a `Date` type is provided, an error will be thrown.\n3. The function will then add the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the `DateTime` object.\n4. The default value of `bump` will be 3 hours if not specified.\n\nHere are the step-by-step actions:\n\n1. Define the function to accept a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` with a default of 3.\n2. Verify if `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` object using `typeof(dt)`.\n3. If `dt` is a `Date` object, throw an error.\n4. Use the `Dates` module (specifically `Hour`) to facilitate the addition of hours.\n5. Return the modified `DateTime` object. \n\nNow, I will implement the function.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if the input is not a Date object\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Only DateTime type is accepted, but received a Date type.\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Add the bump in hours to the DateTime object\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example calls\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))  # Default 3 hours bump\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 5))  # 5 hours bump\n```\n\nWith this implementation, the function adds the specified or default number of hours to the provided `DateTime` and checks and throws an error if `Date` object is mistakenly provided.","status":200,"tokens":[181,435],"elapsed":10.661201125,"cost":0.014860000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-877290651,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
