Defines the main function for DateTime types with a default bump of 3 hours.\n2. Uses a second method to throw an error for Date types.\n3. Utilizes multiple dispatch to handle different input types.\n4. Uses the `Dates.Hour` constructor to create a duration to add to the DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[103,164],"elapsed":2.972379667,"cost":0.0027689999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6614,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
