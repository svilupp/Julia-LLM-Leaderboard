Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime, not Date. Please convert your Date to DateTime first.\"))\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down this implementation:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module, which is necessary for working with `DateTime` and `Date` types.\n\n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n   a. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` for the bump:\n      - It uses the default value of 3 for `bump` if not provided.\n      - It returns a new `DateTime` object increased by `bump` hours using `Hour(bump)`.\n\n   b. The second method is defined for `Date` objects:\n      - It immediately throws an `ArgumentError` with a helpful message explaining that the function only works with `DateTime` objects.\n\n3. By defining these two methods, we achieve function overloading. Julia will automatically choose the correct method based on the type of the first argument.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Using with DateTime (will work)\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 17, 14, 30)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(new_dt)  # 2023-05-17T17:30:00\n\n# Using with DateTime and custom bump\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(new_dt)  # 2023-05-17T19:30:00\n\n# Using with Date (will throw an error)\nd = Date(2023, 5, 17)\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # This will throw an ArgumentError\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected with `DateTime` objects and provides a helpful error message when used with `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,480],"elapsed":6.321701875,"cost":0.007398,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10985,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
