Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module, which is necessary for working with `DateTime` and `Date` types.\n\n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n   a. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` (which defaults to 3 if not provided). It returns a new `DateTime` object with the specified number of hours added.\n\n   b. The second method is defined for `Date` objects. Instead of performing any operation, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message explaining that the function only works with `DateTime` objects.\n\n3. The function uses multiple dispatch to choose the appropriate method based on the type of the first argument.\n\n4. For the `DateTime` method, we use the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module to create a period of the specified number of hours, which we then add to the original `DateTime`.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Using with DateTime (works)\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 17, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Adds 3 hours by default\nprintln(new_dt)  # 2023-05-17T15:00:00\n\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Adds 5 hours\nprintln(new_dt)  # 2023-05-17T17:00:00\n\n# Using with Date (throws error)\nd = Date(2023, 5, 17)\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # This will throw an ArgumentError\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected with `DateTime` objects and throws an informative error when used with `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,499],"elapsed":7.291392166,"cost":0.007683000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10617,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
