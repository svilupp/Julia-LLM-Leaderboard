Accepts a `DateTime` and an optional `bump` (defaulting to 3).\n2. Uses `Hour(bump)` to create a period to add to the `DateTime`.\n3. Includes a method for `Date` that throws an `ArgumentError`.\n4. Uses multiple dispatch to handle different input types.\n\nTo use:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Increases by 3 hours\nnew_dt_custom = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Increases by 5 hours\n\nd = Date(2023, 5, 1)\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # Throws ArgumentError\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,277],"elapsed":4.315211292,"cost":0.004464,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20060,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
