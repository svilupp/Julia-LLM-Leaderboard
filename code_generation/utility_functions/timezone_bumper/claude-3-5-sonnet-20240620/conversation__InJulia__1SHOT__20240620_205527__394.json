Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"Function only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module, which is necessary for working with `DateTime` and `Date` types, as well as the `Hour` type.\n\n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n   a. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` (which defaults to 3 if not provided). It adds the specified number of hours to the given `DateTime` using `Hour(bump)`.\n\n   b. The second method is defined for `Date` objects. Instead of performing any operation, it throws an error with a message explaining that the function only works with `DateTime` types.\n\n3. By defining these two methods, we achieve function overloading. Julia will automatically choose the correct method based on the type of the input.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 17, 14, 30)  # 2023-05-17T14:30:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))  # Will print: 2023-05-17T17:30:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 5))  # Will print: 2023-05-17T19:30:00\n\n# This will throw an error:\n# d = Date(2023, 5, 17)\n# timezone_bumper(d)\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected with `DateTime` objects and throws an informative error when used with `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,443],"elapsed":6.04714725,"cost":0.006843,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7991,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
