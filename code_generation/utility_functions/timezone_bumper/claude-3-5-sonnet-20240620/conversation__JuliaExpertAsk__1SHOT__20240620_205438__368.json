Defines the main function for `DateTime` types, with a default `bump` of 3 hours.\n2. Uses `Hour(bump)` to create a period of hours to add to the `DateTime`.\n3. Defines a second method for `Date` types that throws an `ArgumentError`.\n4. Uses multiple dispatch to handle different input types appropriately.\n\nTo use this function, you'll need to `using Dates` in your Julia environment.","status":200,"tokens":[103,194],"elapsed":3.312557209,"cost":0.0032190000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8390,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
