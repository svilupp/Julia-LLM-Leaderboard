Defines the main function for `DateTime` types, with a default `bump` of 3 hours.\n2. Uses `Dates.Hour()` to create a time period to add to the `DateTime`.\n3. Defines a second method for `Date` types that throws an `ArgumentError`.\n4. Uses multiple dispatch to handle different input types appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[103,177],"elapsed":3.41265175,"cost":0.0029640000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
