Uses multiple dispatch to handle different input types.\n2. The first method works with `DateTime` and has a default `bump` of 3 hours.\n3. The second method throws an `ArgumentError` for `Date` inputs.\n4. Uses the `Hour` type from Dates standard library for time addition.","status":200,"tokens":[103,163],"elapsed":3.058718291,"cost":0.0027540000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":5132,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
