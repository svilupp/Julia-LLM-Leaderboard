Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll create the `timezone_bumper` function as per your requirements. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Define the function with two parameters: `dt` and `bump` with a default value of 3.\n2. Check if the input `dt` is a DateTime type, if not, throw an error.\n3. Add the specified number of hours to the input DateTime.\n4. Return the new DateTime.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if input is DateTime, throw error if it's a Date\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Add the specified number of hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided example and a few additional cases:\n\n```julia\n# Test with the provided example\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))\n\n# Test with default bump value\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))\n\n# Test with negative bump value\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), -2))\n\n# Test with Date input (should throw an error)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(\"Error: \", e)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly handle the given task:\n1. It works with DateTime types.\n2. It allows specifying the number of hours to bump, with a default of 3 hours.\n3. It throws an error when given a Date type instead of a DateTime type.\n\nThe function is concise and follows Julia's conventions for type annotations and error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[189,451],"elapsed":6.709356792,"cost":0.007332,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
