Defines a method for `DateTime` inputs, defaulting `bump` to 3 hours.\n2. Uses `Hour(bump)` to create a period of hours to add to the `DateTime`.\n3. Defines a separate method for `Date` inputs that throws an `ArgumentError`.\n4. Uses multiple dispatch to handle different input types appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[103,170],"elapsed":3.181110375,"cost":0.0028590000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5022,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
