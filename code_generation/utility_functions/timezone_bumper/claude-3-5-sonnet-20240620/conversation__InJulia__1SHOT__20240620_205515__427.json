Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module to work with date and time types.\n\n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n   a. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` parameter (which defaults to 3 if not provided). It adds the specified number of hours to the given DateTime using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n\n   b. The second method is defined for `Date` objects. Instead of performing any operation, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message explaining that the function only works with `DateTime` objects.\n\n3. The `bump` parameter is typed as `Int` in both methods to ensure it's an integer.\n\n4. By defining these two methods, we achieve function overloading based on the type of the first argument. This allows us to handle `DateTime` and `Date` types differently.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 17, 14, 30)  # 2023-05-17T14:30:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))  # Will print 2023-05-17T17:30:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 5))  # Will print 2023-05-17T19:30:00\n\n# This will throw an error:\n# d = Date(2023, 5, 17)\n# timezone_bumper(d)  # ArgumentError: This function only works with DateTime, not Date\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected for `DateTime` objects and throws an informative error for `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,475],"elapsed":6.515978584,"cost":0.0073230000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
