Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works with DateTime, not Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down this implementation:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module, which is necessary for working with `DateTime` and `Date` types, as well as the `Hour` type.\n\n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n   a. The first method takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` (which defaults to 3 if not provided):\n      - It uses the `Hour` constructor to create a duration of `bump` hours.\n      - It adds this duration to the input `DateTime` using the `+` operator.\n      - The result is a new `DateTime` object increased by the specified number of hours.\n\n   b. The second method is defined for `Date` objects:\n      - This method immediately throws an `ArgumentError` with a message explaining that the function only works with `DateTime` objects, not `Date` objects.\n\n3. By defining these two methods, we achieve function overloading. Julia will automatically choose the correct method based on the type of the first argument.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\ndt = DateTime(2023, 5, 17, 14, 30)  # 2023-05-17T14:30:00\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))  # Will print 2023-05-17T17:30:00\n\n# Using a custom bump value:\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 5))  # Will print 2023-05-17T19:30:00\n\n# This will throw an error:\n# timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 5, 17))\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works as expected for `DateTime` objects and throws an informative error for `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[66,494],"elapsed":7.021496458,"cost":0.007608,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5449,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
