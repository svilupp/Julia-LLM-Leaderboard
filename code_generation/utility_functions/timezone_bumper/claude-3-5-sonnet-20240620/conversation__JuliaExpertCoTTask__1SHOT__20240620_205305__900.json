Define the function with default argument for `bump`\n2. Check if the input is a DateTime type\n3. Add the specified hours to the DateTime\n4. Return the new DateTime\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Function only works with DateTime, not Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We import the `Dates` module to work with DateTime types.\n2. We define two methods for `timezone_bumper`:\n   - The first method takes a `DateTime` and an optional `Int` for `bump` (defaulting to 3).\n   - The second method is defined for `Date` types and throws an error.\n3. For the `DateTime` method, we simply add the specified number of hours using `Hour(bump)`.\n4. For the `Date` method, we throw an `ArgumentError` with an explanatory message.\n\nLet's test the function:\n\n```julia\n# Test with the provided example\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Should print 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test with default bump\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\nprintln(result)  # Should print 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test with Date (should throw an error)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Should print the error message\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation satisfies all the requirements:\n- It works with DateTime types\n- It allows for a custom bump value, defaulting to 3 hours\n- It throws an error for Date types\n- It correctly adds the specified number of hours to the input DateTime","status":200,"tokens":[189,492],"elapsed":7.287579167,"cost":0.007947000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11233,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
