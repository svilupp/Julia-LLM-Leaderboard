[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided problem statement and special instructions, here's a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DateTime\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"timezone_bumper: Invalid argument type. Use DateTime types only.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hours(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` argument `dt` and an optional `Int` argument `bump` with a default value of 3 hours. It first checks if the input is a `Date` type using the `isa` function and `Date` type from the `DateTime` library. If the input is a `Date` type, it throws an error using the `error` function with a custom error message. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours in the `bump` argument to the `DateTime` object using the `Hours` constructor from the `DateTime` library and returns the result.\n\nThis solution follows the systematic approach by recalling the necessary Julia syntax for control structures, error handling, and the `DateTime` library. It also prioritizes the special instruction to only work with `DateTime` types and throw an error for `Date` types.\n\nRemember to test the function with various inputs to ensure it's working as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[378,307],"elapsed":2.952684208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
