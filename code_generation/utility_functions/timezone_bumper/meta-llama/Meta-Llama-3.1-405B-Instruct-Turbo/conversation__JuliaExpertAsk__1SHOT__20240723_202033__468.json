The `DateTime` method simply adds the specified number of hours to the input timestamp using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` package. The `Date` method throws an error with a clear message.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\ntimezone_bumper(dt)  # returns 2022-01-01T15:00:00\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # returns 2022-01-01T17:00:00\n\nd = Date(2022, 1, 1)\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # throws an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,236],"elapsed":4.292606375,"cost":0.004070000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":639103048,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
