The function should check if the input is indeed a `DateTime` object and throw an error if it's a `Date` object.\n\n## Step 2: Write the function body\nThe function will use the `+` operator to add the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime` object.\n\n## Step 3: Implement input validation and error handling\nWe will use the `isa` function to check if the input is a `DateTime` object. If not, we will throw a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n\n## Step 4: Test the function with the provided data\nWe will call the `timezone_bumper` function with the provided `DateTime` object and verify that it returns the expected result.\n\nHere is the code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(TypeError(\"Input must be a DateTime object\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n2023-04-10T15:00:00","status":200,"tokens":[185,310],"elapsed":5.536755792,"cost":0.005575,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":954937623,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
