[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task: \n   - The `Dates` module provides the `DateTime` type and the `Hour` type, which will be used to bump the timestamp.\n   - The `throw` function is used to throw an error if the input is not of type `DateTime`.\n   - The `typeof` function is used to check the type of the input.\n   - The `+` operator is used to add the `bump` hours to the timestamp.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n   - Define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `Int` `bump` (defaulting to 3).\n   - Check if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, throw an error.\n   - Return the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function only works with `DateTime` objects, as required.\n   - The function adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp, as required.\n   - The function throws an error if the input is not of type `DateTime`, as required.","status":200,"tokens":[328,328],"elapsed":8.98050075,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1156897160,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
