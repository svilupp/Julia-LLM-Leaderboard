Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !(typeof(dt) <: DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` (the timestamp to be bumped) and `bump` (the number of hours to bump the timestamp by, defaulting to 3).\n- The function first checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that the input must be of type `DateTime`.\n- If the input is of type `DateTime`, the function adds `Hour(bump)` to `dt` and returns the result. The `Hour` function is used to create a `Hour` type object that represents the bump amount, which is then added to `dt` using the `+` operator.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 3 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T15:00:00\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 5 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `DateTime` object representing January 1, 2022, 12:00:00, and then use the `timezone_bumper` function to bump it by 3 hours and 5 hours, respectively. The bumped timestamps are then printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[71,416],"elapsed":14.100533,"cost":8.198e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-112489886,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
