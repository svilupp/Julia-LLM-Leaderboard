Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour + bump, dt.minute, dt.second)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is expected to be of type `DateTime`, and `bump` is an optional argument with a default value of 3.\n- The function first checks if `dt` is indeed of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that the input must be of type `DateTime`.\n- If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, the function creates a new `DateTime` object with the same year, month, and day as the original `dt`, but with the hour incremented by `bump` hours. The minute and second are preserved.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n\n# Increase the DateTime by 3 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\n\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T15:00:00\n\n# Increase the DateTime by 5 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T17:00:00\n```\n\nNote that the `DateTime` type in Julia is a struct that represents a date and time, and it has methods for various operations, including adding hours. The `timezone_bumper` function uses these methods to create a new `DateTime` object with the desired hour value.","status":200,"tokens":[71,410],"elapsed":2.605814542,"cost":8.09e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-259865415,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
