If it's not, we throw an `ArgumentError`.\n* We use the `+` operator to add the specified number of hours to the DateTime object. This is done using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` package, which is included in the Julia standard library.\n* Finally, we return the bumped DateTime object.\n\nExample use cases:\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n\n# Bump the DateTime object by 3 hours (default)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T15:00:00\n\n# Bump the DateTime object by 6 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 6)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T18:00:00\n\n# Try to bump a Date object (should throw an error)\ndate = Date(2022, 1, 1)\ntry\n    bumped_date = timezone_bumper(date)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Output: Input must be a DateTime object, not a Date object\nend\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `Dates` package is already loaded. If you haven't loaded it yet, you can do so by running `using Dates` in your Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[71,577],"elapsed":3.140424417,"cost":0.00049772,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":941051429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
