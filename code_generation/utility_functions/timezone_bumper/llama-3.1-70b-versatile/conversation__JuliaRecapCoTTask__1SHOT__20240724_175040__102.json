[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided specifications, here is the code that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\n# Task: timezone_bumper\n# Purpose: Increases a provided DateTime timestamp by a specified number of hours\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Ensure dt is a DateTime object\n    @assert typeof(dt) <: DateTime \"Input must be a DateTime object\"\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* We define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and `bump` of type `Int` with a default value of 3.\n* We use the `@assert` macro to check if the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` object. If it's not, the function will throw an error with the specified message.\n* We then use the `+` operator to add the specified number of hours to the `dt` object. We use the `Hour` type from the `Dates` package to represent the time interval.\n\nNote: The `Dates` package is part of the Julia standard library, so we don't need to add any additional dependencies.\n\nThis code should meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
