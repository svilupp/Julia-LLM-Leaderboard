The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt` (DateTime object) and `bump` (number of hours to increase, defaulting to 3).\n2.  It checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an `ArgumentError`.\n3.  It calculates the new DateTime by adding the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the input DateTime (`dt`) using the `+` operator and the `Hour` function from the `Dates` package.\n4.  The function returns the new DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[185,372],"elapsed":2.611376458,"cost":0.00040302999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1052257957,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
