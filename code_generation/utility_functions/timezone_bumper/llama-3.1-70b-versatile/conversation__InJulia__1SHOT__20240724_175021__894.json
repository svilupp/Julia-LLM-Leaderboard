Don't copy for nonexample work, due to safety & concurrency!\nmydt = now(Dates.UTC)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(mydt,2))  # You may print now depending on console printing current hours before doing other calculation  \n# We just now output one created DTZ; This proves default adds hours automatically like, your region zone being London on output hour we read so plus so not this of manual effort input every needed item times given localzone \"dt “ at timezone” ,as first mentioned America or non for USA others one” bumps .\n# Error as you suggested since there should have just input nothing given different usage where each works we ask DT no way allowed except is expected; given should look of being accepted yet which alos defined example codes ,right non-contract breach should really defined using we mentioned otherwise its user decision: wrong used data you be now set always ensure types checking then by,defined can further show! For output more codes all all or added shown working version since dates must a first;type period value each dt after may next different again function version print hour do some good best have: have examples be correct I decided type make from after showing input added only codes user how know a specific correct case without hour’s manual even really case on simple data \n```","status":200,"tokens":[71,444],"elapsed":3.097660167,"cost":0.00039265,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2058414417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
