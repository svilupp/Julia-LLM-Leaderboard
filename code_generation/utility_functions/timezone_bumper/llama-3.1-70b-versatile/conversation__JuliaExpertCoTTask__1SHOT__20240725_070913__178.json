We import the `Dates` package to work with date and time types.\n2. We define the `timezone_bumper` function with two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is expected to be of type `DateTime`, and `bump` is an optional argument that defaults to 3 if not provided.\n3. We check if `dt` is indeed of type `DateTime` using the `isa` function. If not, we throw an `ArgumentError`.\n4. If `dt` is valid, we add `bump` hours to it using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` package.\n5. We test the function with the provided example.","status":200,"tokens":[185,267],"elapsed":1.427946709,"cost":0.00032008,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1960080930,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
