If not, throw an error.\n   - Increase the `DateTime` object by the specified number of hours.\n   - Return the modified `DateTime` object.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n   - Import necessary modules.\n   - Define the function with appropriate type checks and error handling.\n   - Implement the logic to bump the time.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - Implement the function as described.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n   - Test the function with the provided data and additional test cases.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))\n\n# Additional test cases\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))  # Default bump of 3 hours\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 5))  # Bump of 5 hours\n\n# Test with Date type to ensure it throws an error\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10)))\ncatch e\n    println(\"Error:\", e)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - The function `timezone_bumper` is defined to take a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` which defaults to 3.\n   - Another method is defined for `Date` type to throw an error if a `Date` object is passed.\n\n2. **Type Checking and Error Handling:**\n   - The function checks if the input is of type `DateTime`. If it is a `Date`, it throws an `ArgumentError`.\n\n3. **Time Bumping Logic:**\n   - The function increases the `DateTime` object by the specified number of hours using `Hour(bump)`.\n\n4. **Testing:**\n   - The function is tested with the provided data and additional test cases to ensure correctness.\n   - An error case is also tested to ensure the function handles `Date` types correctly by throwing an error.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is robust and handles different types of inputs appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[205,690],"elapsed":23.416732375,"cost":0.006825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-158484104,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
