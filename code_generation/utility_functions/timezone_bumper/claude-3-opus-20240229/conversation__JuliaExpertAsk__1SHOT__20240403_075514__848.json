Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first method of `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `bump` parameter of type `Int` with a default value of 3.\n  - It returns a new `DateTime` object by adding the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the input `dt` using the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module.\n\n- The second method of `timezone_bumper` is specifically defined for `Date` types.\n  - It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that the function only works for `DateTime` types and not `Date` types.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works correctly for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[103,261],"elapsed":11.563820208,"cost":0.02112,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21101,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
