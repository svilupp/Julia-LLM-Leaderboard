Check that the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, throw an error.\n2. Add the `bump` hours to the `dt` timestamp using the `+` operator and return the result.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types, not Date types\")\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n# Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))  # using default bump of 3 hours\n# Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\n# Output: ERROR: timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types, not Date types\n```\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- Using multiple dispatch to define separate methods for `DateTime` and `Date` input types\n- For `DateTime`, simply adding `Hour(bump)` to `dt` \n- For `Date`, throwing an error with a clear message\n- Providing a default value of 3 for `bump`\n\nSo this `timezone_bumper` function will work as expected, increasing a `DateTime` by the specified number of hours (default 3), while throwing an error if called with a `Date` type.","status":200,"tokens":[189,398],"elapsed":15.126500084,"cost":0.032685,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20357,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
