Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that increases a provided timestamp by `bump` hours (defaulting to +3 hours) and works only for `DateTime` types, throwing an error for `Date` types:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `timezone_bumper` is defined with two methods, one for `DateTime` types and one for `Date` types.\n- The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `bump` parameter of type `Int` with a default value of 3.\n  - It adds the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the `dt` timestamp using `Dates.Hour(bump)` and returns the resulting `DateTime` object.\n- The second method is defined for `Date` types and throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` types, not `Date` types.\n  - This method is invoked when `timezone_bumper` is called with a `Date` object, and it will raise an error.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage with DateTime\ndt1 = DateTime(2023, 6, 10, 12, 0, 0)\nbumped_dt1 = timezone_bumper(dt1)  # Default bump of 3 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt1)  # Output: 2023-06-10T15:00:00\n\ndt2 = DateTime(2023, 6, 10, 12, 0, 0)\nbumped_dt2 = timezone_bumper(dt2, 5)  # Custom bump of 5 hours\nprintln(bumped_dt2)  # Output: 2023-06-10T17:00:00\n\n# Example usage with Date (throws an error)\nd = Date(2023, 6, 10)\nbumped_d = timezone_bumper(d)  # Throws an ArgumentError\n```\n\nIn the examples above:\n- When `timezone_bumper` is called with a `DateTime` object `dt1` and no `bump` argument, it adds the default 3 hours to the timestamp.\n- When `timezone_bumper` is called with a `DateTime` object `dt2` and a custom `bump` of 5 hours, it adds 5 hours to the timestamp.\n- When `timezone_bumper` is called with a `Date` object `d`, it throws an `ArgumentError` indicating that the function only works with `DateTime` types.\n\nThis implementation ensures that `timezone_bumper` only accepts `DateTime` objects and raises an error when called with a `Date` object.","status":200,"tokens":[66,701],"elapsed":26.639220334,"cost":0.053564999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27580,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
