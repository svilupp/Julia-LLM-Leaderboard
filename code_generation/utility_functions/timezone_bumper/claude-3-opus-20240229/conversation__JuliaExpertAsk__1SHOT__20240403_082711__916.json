Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper does not support Date types, only DateTime\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The first method of `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `bump` parameter of type `Int` with a default value of 3.\n   - It adds the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the `dt` timestamp using `Dates.Hour(bump)` and returns the resulting `DateTime`.\n\n2. The second method of `timezone_bumper` is defined for `Date` types.\n   - It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` does not support `Date` types and only works with `DateTime`.\n\nBy using multiple dispatch, the function behaves differently based on the type of the first argument `dt`. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it applies the time zone bump. If `dt` is a `Date`, it throws an error.\n\nHere are a few examples of how to use the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 6, 10, 12, 0, 0))\n2023-06-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 6, 10, 12, 0, 0), 5)\n2023-06-10T17:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 6, 10))\nERROR: ArgumentError: timezone_bumper does not support Date types, only DateTime\n```\n\nThe function correctly increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours for `DateTime` inputs and throws an error for `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[103,466],"elapsed":19.063241875,"cost":0.03649499999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13074,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
