Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `timezone_bumper` that increases a given timestamp by a specified number of hours (defaulting to +3 hours) and only works for `DateTime` types:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date) = error(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The first method of `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional `Int` parameter `bump` with a default value of 3.\n   - It adds the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the `DateTime` object using the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module.\n   - The result is a new `DateTime` object with the increased timestamp.\n\n2. The second method of `timezone_bumper` is a fallback method that is called when the input is of type `Date`.\n   - It throws an error with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` types.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> using Dates\n\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 6, 10, 12, 0, 0)\n2023-06-10T12:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2023-06-10T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n2023-06-10T17:00:00\n\njulia> d = Date(2023, 6, 10)\n2023-06-10\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(d)\nERROR: timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that `timezone_bumper` only accepts `DateTime` objects and increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours (default +3 hours). It throws an error if a `Date` object is provided.","status":200,"tokens":[103,442],"elapsed":16.283224583,"cost":0.034695,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14229,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
