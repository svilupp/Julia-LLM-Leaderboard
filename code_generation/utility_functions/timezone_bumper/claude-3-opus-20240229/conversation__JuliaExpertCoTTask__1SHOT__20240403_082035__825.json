Check if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`\n2. If not, throw an error\n3. Extract the hour component from the `DateTime`\n4. Add the `bump` value to the hour\n5. Construct a new `DateTime` with the updated hour\n6. Return the new `DateTime`\n\nCode:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    hour = Dates.hour(dt)\n    new_hour = hour + bump\n    return DateTime(Dates.year(dt), Dates.month(dt), Dates.day(dt), new_hour, Dates.minute(dt), Dates.second(dt))\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\")\nend\n```\n\nTesting the solution:\n\n```julia\n# Test case from the Data section\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test case with default bump value\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test case with Date type (should throw an error)\njulia> timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\nERROR: timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not Date types\n```\n\nThe solution checks the type of the input `dt` and dispatches to the appropriate method. For `DateTime` input, it extracts the components, adds the `bump` value to the hour, and constructs a new `DateTime`. For `Date` input, it throws an error.\n\nThe solution appears to be correct based on the given test cases.","status":200,"tokens":[189,450],"elapsed":17.520614667,"cost":0.03658499999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29666,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
