Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's break down the task and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function `timezone_bumper` with two parameters: `dt` for the timestamp and `bump` for the hours to increase.\n2. **Type Checking**: Ensure the function only accepts `DateTime` types. If `Date` type is provided, it should throw an error.\n3. **Default Parameter**: Set the `bump` parameter to default to 3 if not provided.\n4. **Time Adjustment**: Calculate the new time by adding the specified number of hours.\n5. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where the input is not a `DateTime` type.\n\nNow, let's write the Julia function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Function does not support Date types, only DateTime types are allowed.\"))\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The first `timezone_bumper` function is for `DateTime` types, where we adjust the time by adding the specified `bump` hours. The `bump` has a default value of 3.\n- The second `timezone_bumper` function, specifically for `Date` types, throws an `ArgumentError` indicating that the function is not designed for `Date`.\n\nLet's test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\n# Test with provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test with default bump\nresult_default = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\nprintln(result_default)  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test with Date type to check error handling\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expected: ArgumentError about Date type\nend\n```\n\nThese implementations and test cases fulfill the task requirements and ensure correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[183,475],"elapsed":8.34454525,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2141285091,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
