Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia, we'll write a function that checks if the input is a `DateTime` and adjusts the timestamp by a specified number of hours. If the input is a `Date`, the function will throw an error, as we do not want to handle such cases. We'll also set a default bump of 3 hours if not specified.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function does not support Date objects. Please provide a DateTime object.\"))\nend\n\n# This will prevent calling the function with any type other than DateTime or Date\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (dt, bump)))\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function for DateTime**:\n   - The first method is for `DateTime` inputs: it takes a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` that defaults to 3. It adds the specified hours to the input `DateTime`.\n\n2. **Function for Date**:\n   - The second method is specifically for `Date` inputs. If a `Date` is provided, it throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that only `DateTime` objects are supported.\n\n3. **Fallback for other types**:\n   - The last method is a catch-all fallback that throws a `MethodError` if the input type is neither `DateTime` nor `Date`. This ensures that invalid types are not silently handled.\n\nBy structuring the function this way, you ensure that it works correctly for `DateTime` objects and provides clear feedback when passed invalid input types.","status":200,"tokens":[68,396],"elapsed":3.838957417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1455835693,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
