Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! In Julia, you can achieve this by defining the function `timezone_bumper` to take advantage of multiple dispatch to ensure it works only with `DateTime` objects. If the user tries to pass a `Date` object, the function will throw an error. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime objects, not Date.\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# dt = DateTime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0)\n# new_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Defaults to bumping by 3 hours\n# new_dt_with_custom_bump = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # Bumps by 5 hours\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Signature and Dispatch**: The `timezone_bumper` function first checks for a `DateTime` type input with an optional `bump` parameter (defaulting to 3 hours). It uses `Hour(bump)` from the `Dates` library to correctly add the specified number of hours to the `DateTime`.\n\n2. **Error Handling for Date**: A second method is declared for the `Date` type that throws an `ArgumentError`. This ensures the function will properly notify the user if an unsupported type is passed.\n\n3. **Usage**: You can simply call `timezone_bumper` with either a `DateTime` object on its own or with a specific bump value to shift by the desired number of hours. If a `Date` is used as input, it will raise an error.\n\nThis structure leverages Juliaâ€™s powerful type system and multiple dispatch capabilities to provide clear and precise error handling and functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[68,390],"elapsed":4.120848875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-139049547,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
