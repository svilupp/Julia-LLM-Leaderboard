The function should have a default bump of 3 hours. It should throw an error if the input is a Date type.\n\n2. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a DateTime object, and `bump` which is an optional integer with a default value of 3.\n   - Determine if the passed `dt` is a Date object and raise an error in that case.\n   - Use the DateTime functionality to add hours to `dt`.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We'll use Julia's DateTime manipulation capabilities to add hours to the DateTime object.\n\n4. **Testing**: We'll test the function with the provided data and add a case where `dt` is a Date to ensure the error is raised.\n\nHere's how we can implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Any, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper is only valid for DateTime types, not Date types\"))\n    elseif isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(TypeError(\"Unsupported type: \", typeof(dt)))\n    end\nend\n\n# Testing with provided data\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 3))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Testing the error for Date type\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expected to catch the ArgumentError\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Checking Type**: The function checks if `dt` is of type `Date` and raises an error. It extends support only for `DateTime`.\n- **Time Addition**: Uses `Hour(bump)` to add hours to `dt`.\n- **Error Handling**: Appropriately handles Argument and Type errors to ensure proper function operation and user feedback.","status":200,"tokens":[183,483],"elapsed":7.486818292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1750434104,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
