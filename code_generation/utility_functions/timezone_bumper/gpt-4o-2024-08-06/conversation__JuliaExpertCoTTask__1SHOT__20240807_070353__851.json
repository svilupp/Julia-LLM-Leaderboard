Define the function `timezone_bumper` that accepts two parameters: `dt` and an optional `bump`.\n2. Ensure that `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If `dt` is of type `Date`, throw an error.\n3. If `bump` is not provided, set it to default to 3 hours.\n4. Add the `bump` to the given DateTime.\n5. Return the updated DateTime.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime, Date}, bump::Int=3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date\"))\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function with the given data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Additional test to ensure it throws an error for Date type\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expected: ArgumentError for Date type\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we check that `dt` is a `DateTime`. If it is a `Date`, we throw an `ArgumentError`. The `bump` parameter defaults to 3 hours if not provided, and we make use of the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module to add the specified hours to the `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[183,360],"elapsed":4.183277417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":82548885,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
