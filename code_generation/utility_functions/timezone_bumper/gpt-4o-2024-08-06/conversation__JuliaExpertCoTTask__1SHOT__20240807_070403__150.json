If it's not, we should throw an error.\n3. **Increment the Time:** Add the `bump` value to the hours of the timestamp.\n4. **Default Value:** The `bump` parameter should default to +3 hours if not provided.\n5. **Return Result:** Return the modified DateTime object.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Increment the DateTime by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overloaded method for error if Date is passed\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Function only works with DateTime types\"))\nend\n```\n\n### Test the Implementation\n\nLet's test the function with provided data and check that it works correctly only for DateTime:\n\n```julia\n# Provided Data Test\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, bump))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test default bump\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Test with different bump\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 5))  # Expected: 2023-04-10T17:00:00\n\n# Test with Date to ensure error\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expected to print the error message\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation should fulfill the task requirements and handle the edge cases as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[183,433],"elapsed":5.404554584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1650534565,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
