If it's a `Date`, raise an error.\n3. Add `bump` hours to the `DateTime` object.\n4. Return the updated `DateTime`.\n\nNow, let's implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Expected Result: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThis code will increase the given `DateTime` by the specified number of hours. If you encounter an argument that isn't a `DateTime`, you should ensure the input data before calling the function.","status":200,"tokens":[183,243],"elapsed":4.962786542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-268673447,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
