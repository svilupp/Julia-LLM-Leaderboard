Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define the function `timezone_bumper` that takes two parameters: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an integer with a default value of 3).\n\n2. **Type Checking**: Ensure the `dt` parameter is specifically of the type `DateTime`. If `dt` is not a `DateTime` (such as a `Date` type), the function should raise an error.\n\n3. **Add Hours**: If the type is correct, increase the `dt` timestamp by the specified number of hours (`bump`).\n\n4. **Return Result**: Return the updated DateTime object.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where a `Date` type is passed by throwing an appropriate error.\n\nHere's the Julia code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Adding specified hours to the DateTime object\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    # Throw error if a Date object is provided instead of DateTime\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Function only accepts DateTime objects, not Date objects\"))\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Should print: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n\n# Uncomment the below line to test the error\n# timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3) # Should throw an error\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We've defined an overloaded method for `timezone_bumper` that throws an error if a `Date` type is passed.\n- If a `DateTime` object is provided, it adds the specified number of hours and returns the updated timestamp. \n- The function defaults to adding 3 hours if no `bump` is specified.","status":200,"tokens":[183,433],"elapsed":6.611734958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":29160131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
