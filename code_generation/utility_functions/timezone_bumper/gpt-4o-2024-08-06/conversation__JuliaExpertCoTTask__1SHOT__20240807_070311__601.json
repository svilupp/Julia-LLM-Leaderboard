We'll implement this using Julia's type checking.\n\n3. **Step 3**: We will use Julia's DateTime arithmetic to add the specified number of hours to the DateTime object.\n\n4. **Step 4**: Implement error handling to ensure the function is used correctly.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"Function only accepts DateTime objects, not Date objects.\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `timezone_bumper` is defined with two methods: one for `DateTime` and one for `Date`.\n- When a `DateTime` is passed, it adds the `bump` hours using `Hour(bump)`.\n- When a `Date` is passed, it throws an error.\n- By specifying multiple methods for the `timezone_bumper` function, we can ensure that the error handling is automatic based on the input type.\n\n### Check:\n\n- The solution should correctly add hours to a `DateTime` object.\n- The solution should throw an error if a `Date` object is passed. \n\nThis implementation should behave as expected with the provided data and requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[183,413],"elapsed":4.267132333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":802712033,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
