Define the function `timezone_bumper` with the parameters `dt` and `bump`. The parameter `bump` should have a default value of 3.\n2. Inside the function, check if the provided `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is not, throw an error.\n3. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, increase it by `bump` hours.\n4. Return the updated `DateTime`.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The function only accepts DateTime types.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)) # Should print: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We first check if `dt` is an instance of `DateTime`. If not, we raise an `ArgumentError` which explicitly mentions that only `DateTime` types are accepted.\n- If `dt` is valid, we bump it by the specified number of hours using `Hour(bump)`. The default bump is 3 hours if not specified.\n- We return the adjusted `DateTime`.\n\nThis approach handles the task as requested, ensuring type safety where only `DateTime` objects are modified and errors are thrown for `Date` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[183,337],"elapsed":5.690517583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-62884238,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
