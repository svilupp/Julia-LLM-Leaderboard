If not, the function will throw an error.\n3. **Implement default bump**: The `bump` argument will have a default value of `3` if not specified.\n4. **Perform the bump**: We will increase the `dt` by the specified number of hours.\n5. **Return the result**: Output the modified timestamp.\n\nNow, let's write the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Any, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if the input is of type DateTime\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        # Add the specified bump in hours to the DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        # Throw an error if the input is not of type DateTime\n        error(\"timezone_bumper works only with DateTime types and not with Date types.\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `timezone_bumper`, checks the type of `dt` to make sure it's a `DateTime`, and bumps it by the specified number of hours (default is 3). If the type is not `DateTime`, it throws an error. Finally, it tests the function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[183,363],"elapsed":4.153019916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-627703933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
