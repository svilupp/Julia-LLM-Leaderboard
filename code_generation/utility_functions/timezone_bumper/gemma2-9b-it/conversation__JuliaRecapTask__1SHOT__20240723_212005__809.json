[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This is crucial for correct time arithmetic.\n     - `bump * Hours`: We create a duration representing the `bump` value in hours.\n     - `dt .+`: The `.+` operator works with Dates and DateTime types, adding the duration to the `dt` object. \n     -  The result is a new DateTime object with the adjusted time.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks you'd like me to solve!","status":200,"tokens":[341,334],"elapsed":0.935005875,"cost":0.00013499999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":532155269,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
