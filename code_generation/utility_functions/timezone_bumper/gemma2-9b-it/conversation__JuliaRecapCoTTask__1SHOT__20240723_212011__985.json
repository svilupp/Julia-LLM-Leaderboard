[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This ensures that we only operate on DateTime objects. Should we ever need to handle Dates, we could extend the function using multiple dispatch or provide a separate function.\n2. **Default Value:** We set `bump` to 3 hours by default using `bump::Int = 3`.\n3. **Time Adjustment:** We calculate the duration to be added as `Duration(hours = bump)` and add it to the input `dt` to effectively shift it forward by `bump` hours.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see this function used in a more elaborate example or have any further modifications in mind!","status":200,"tokens":[342,188],"elapsed":0.628545833,"cost":0.000106,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1570011786,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
