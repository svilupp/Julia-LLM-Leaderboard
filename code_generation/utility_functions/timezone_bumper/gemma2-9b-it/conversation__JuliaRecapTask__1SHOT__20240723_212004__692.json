[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n  if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n    throw(TypeError(\"Input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\"))\n  end\n  return dt + (bump * 1 * Hours)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Type Check:** We first ensure the input `dt` is a `DateTime` using `isa(dt, DateTime)`. If not, we throw a `TypeError` indicating the expected input type. \n2. **Bump:** We multiply the `bump` value by 1 and then convert it to `Hours` unit to correctly add the time offset to the `DateTime` object.\n3. **Return:** Finally, we return the new `DateTime` object after adding the time offset.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks you'd like me to solve!","status":200,"tokens":[341,194],"elapsed":0.646911042,"cost":0.000107,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-827582105,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
