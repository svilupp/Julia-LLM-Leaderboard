Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n  return dt + (bump * hours) \nend\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`function timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)`:**\n   -  Defines a function named `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments:\n       -  `dt`: A `DateTime` object representing the timestamp.\n       - `bump`: An integer indicating the number of hours to add. It has a default value of `3`.\n\n2. **`dt + (bump * hours)`:**\n   -  Calculates the new timestamp by adding `bump` hours to the original timestamp (`dt`).\n   -  `hours` is a special type in Julia representing an hour duration.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n\n   - The code automatically handles errors by ensuring that the input `dt` must be a `DateTime` object. \n     - If you pass in a `Date` object, Julia will throw a type error.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object\nnow = now()  \n\n# Bump the timestamp by 3 hours\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(now)\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 6 hours\nbumped_for_six = timezone_bumper(now, 6)\n\n# You cannot pass in a Date object\n# dt_object = Date(2023, 12, 25)\n# timezone_bumper(dt_object)  # This will raise a TypeError\n```\n\n\n\nRemember that while this function provides a basic way to adjust timestamps, you may want to explore more sophisticated time zone handling mechanisms for real-world applications, especially when dealing with international data.","status":200,"tokens":[70,380],"elapsed":1.006029,"cost":8.999999999999999e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1807590608,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
