X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

First, we recall that Julia has a built-in library `Dates` which contains the necessary types and functions for handling dates and times. In particular, the `DateTime` type is used to represent a specific point in time with both date and time components.\n  2. Next, we define the function `timezone_bumper` with two arguments: `dt` for the input timestamp (which should be a `DateTime` object) and `bump` for the number of hours to add (which should be an integer, with a default value of 3).\n  3. The function begins with a type check to ensure that `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` object, using the `typeof` function. If it is not, we throw an error using the `error` function.\n  4. If the input timestamp is valid, we use the `Timedelta` function from the `Dates`","status":200,"tokens":[327,200],"elapsed":3.834632042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":2038384739,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
