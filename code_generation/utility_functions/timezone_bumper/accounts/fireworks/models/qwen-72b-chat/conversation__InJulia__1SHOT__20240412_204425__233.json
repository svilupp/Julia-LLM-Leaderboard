Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime,bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"Function only works with DateTime objects, not Date objects.\")\nend\n```\n\nThe above code defines two functions both named `timezone_bumper`. The first one takes in a `DateTime` object and an optional integer argument `bump`, which defaults to 3. It adds `bump` hours to the input `DateTime` using the `Hour` function from the `Dates` module in Julia and returns the result.\nThe second function takes in a `Date` object and throws an error with a message indicating that the function only works with `DateTime` objects, not `Date` objects. This ensures that the function will not be called with the wrong type of input.\nYou can use the function as follows:\n```python\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2022-01-","status":200,"tokens":[69,200],"elapsed":3.816136875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":2099565619,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
