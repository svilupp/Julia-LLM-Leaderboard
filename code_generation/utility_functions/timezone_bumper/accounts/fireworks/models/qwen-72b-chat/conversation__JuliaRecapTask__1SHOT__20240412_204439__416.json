[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

To solve this task, we need to define a `timezone_bumper` function that takes two arguments, `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is the timestamp we want to increase and `bump` is the number of hours by which we want to increase the timestamp. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours. We also need to make sure that the function only works for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.\nLet's start by coding these requirements.\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Return error if the input is a Date type\n    isa(dt, Date) && error(\"Input must be a DateTime\")\n    # Increase the timestamp by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer argument `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[327,200],"elapsed":3.831646125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1002714086,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
