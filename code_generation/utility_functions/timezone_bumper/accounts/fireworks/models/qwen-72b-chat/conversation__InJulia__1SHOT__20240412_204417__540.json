Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia that meets the requirements:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper only supports DateTime types, not Date types\")\nend\n```\n\nThe first function definition handles the case where a `DateTime` is provided. It adds `bump` hours to the input `dt` using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module in Julia's standard library. The default value for `bump` is set to 3.\nThe second function definition handles the case where a `Date` is provided. It throws an error indicating that the function only supports `DateTime` types. This ensures that the function only works as expected for the intended input types.<|im_end|>\n<|endoftext|>","status":200,"tokens":[69,188],"elapsed":3.662214875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":471967846,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
