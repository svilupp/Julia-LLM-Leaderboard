Please convert the date to DateTime before running this function.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We check if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, an `ErrorException` is thrown with a custom message.\n- If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, we create a new `Hour` object with the offset `bump` and add it to `dt`.\n- The new function can be called with an optional second argument `bump`, which defaults to `3` if not provided.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nnow = DateTime(now())\nprintln(now)  # prints the current time\nbumped = timezone_bumper(now, 3)\nprintln(bumped)  # prints the current time with a +3 hour timezone bump\n```\n\nNote that this function will throw an `ErrorException` if you try to use it with any date type other than `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[70,258],"elapsed":1.015469833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1611844051,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
