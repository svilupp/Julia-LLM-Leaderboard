It checks if the input is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. If it is, it uses the `addhours` function to increment the `DateTime` object by the specified `bump` in hours. If `bump` is not specified, it defaults to 3 hours as per the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[184,280],"elapsed":1.072083833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1955344157,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
