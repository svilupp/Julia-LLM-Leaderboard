[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If the input is not of type `DateTime`, it throws an `ArgumentError`. Then it adds the specified number of hours to the input date using the `Hour` struct. \n\nWhen you call the function as shown in the example section, it returns `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`, which is the DateTime that is 3 hours after the input DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[184,220],"elapsed":1.051900917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1521797739,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
