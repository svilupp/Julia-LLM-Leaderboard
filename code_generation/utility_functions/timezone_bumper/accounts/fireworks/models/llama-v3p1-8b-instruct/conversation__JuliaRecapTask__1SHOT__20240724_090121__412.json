[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If not, it raises a MethodError as per the problem.\n- It creates a new `DateTime` object where the hour of `dt` is increased by `bump`.\n- It keeps adjusting the new object if the hour becomes greater than or equal to 24 or the minute becomes greater than or equal to 60 so that the new time is within a day.\n- Finally, it returns the new `DateTime` object.","status":200,"tokens":[327,287],"elapsed":1.139439834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1814808277,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
