Think through the approach: We need to define a function that takes a DateTime object and an optional integer, and returns a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours ahead of the input.\n2. Write any necessary functions and code: We define the `timezone_bumper` function, which checks the type of the input, increases the DateTime by the specified number of hours, and returns the result.\n3. Solve the task: We use the `+` operator with a `Hour` object to increase the DateTime by the specified number of hours.\n4. Check that the solution is correct: We include an example usage of the function to verify that it produces the correct output.","status":200,"tokens":[184,312],"elapsed":4.787993459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":201005931,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
