It first checks that the input `dt` is of `DateTime` type. If not, it throws an error. It then bumps the `DateTime` by the specified hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module. The bumped `DateTime` is returned as a result.\n\nPlease ensure that the `Dates` package is installed and loaded in your Julia environment for this code to run correctly. You can install it by running `Pkg.add(\"Dates\")` in the Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[184,360],"elapsed":5.880381666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-517250465,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
