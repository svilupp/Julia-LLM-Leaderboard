[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Import the required library\nusing Dates\n\n# Define the timezone_bumper function\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if the dt is of DateTime type\n    if !(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Apply the time bump\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n```\n\nThis code snippet begins by importing the `Dates` library which is necessary for manipulating DateTime objects in Julia.\n\nThen, the `timezone_bumper` function is defined with `dt` as a positional argument and `bump` as an optional argument with a default value of 3. This function is designed to work with DateTime objects only and will throw an error if a different data type is provided. The function checks if the provided date is of the DateTime type and throws an error if it's not. Finally, the function applies the time bump to the DateTime object.\n\n\n### Usage Examples:\n```julia\n\n# Example usage with DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(\"2022-01-01T12:00:00\")\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 5)) # Output: 2022-01-01T17:00:00\n\n# Example usage with Date object\ndate = Date(\"2022-01-01\")\ntry \n    println(timezone_bumper(date, 5))\ncatch e\n    println(e) \nend # Output: Input must be of type DateTime\n```","status":200,"tokens":[328,328],"elapsed":3.279302,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-460062624,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
