Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement this function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime arguments\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is the datetime to be bumped, and `bump` is the number of hours to bump it. `bump` has a default value of 3, meaning the datetime will be bumped by 3 hours if `bump` isn't provided.\n* The function first checks whether `dt` is a `DateTime` object. If it's not, it throws an `ErrorException`.\n* If `dt` is a `DateTime`, the function simply adds `bump` hours to `dt` using the `+` operator, which is overloaded for `DateTime` and `Period` types in Julia. The result is then returned.\n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime\ndt = DateTime(2024, 3, 4, 10, 0, 0)\nprintln(dt)  # prints: 2024-03-04T10:00:00\n\n# Bump it by the default amount (3 hours)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt)  # prints: 2024-03-04T13:00:00\n\n# Bump it by a custom amount\nbumped_dt_custom = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(bumped_dt_custom)  # prints: 2024-03-04T15:00:00\n```\nNote that if you try to bump a `Date` (which isn't supported), the function will throw an error:\n```julia\n# Try to bump a Date\nd = Date(2024, 3, 4)\ntry\n    bumped_d = timezone_bumper(d)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # prints: timezone_bumper only accepts DateTime arguments\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[70,457],"elapsed":7.065978584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-878722777,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
