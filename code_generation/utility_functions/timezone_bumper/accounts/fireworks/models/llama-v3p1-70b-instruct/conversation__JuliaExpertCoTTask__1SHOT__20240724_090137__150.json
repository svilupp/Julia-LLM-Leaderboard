We use the `Dates` package, which is part of the Julia standard library.\n2. The function `timezone_bumper` checks if the input is of type `DateTime` and throws an `ErrorException` if not.\n3. We then add `bump` hours to the `DateTime` object `dt` using the `Hour` type.\n4. In the example usage, we increase the timestamp `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[184,210],"elapsed":2.665909666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2117278177,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
