The `dt` argument should be a DateTime object and `bump` should be an integer representing the number of hours to \"bump\" or increase the DateTime object by. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n*   We add some error checking code in the function to make sure `dt` is a DateTime type and `bump` is an integer type. If either of these conditions is not met, an error will be raised.\n*   We then test the function with the provided DateTime object `(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` and bump it by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[184,304],"elapsed":3.978965125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-436147272,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
