Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"Location type is Date and needs to be DateTime\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, `timezone_bumper` raises an error when `dt` has type `Date`, as per the question. In Julia, you can't just declare the function once because it uses multiple dispatch to choose the function based on the function's input types. Hence why the function has to be declared separately for the `Date` type.\n\nHowever, there is a need to use another dispatch on `Any` type to get error messages similar to Python's instead of `MethodError`. The function is changed to throw a proper error message when called with other argument types:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date)\n    error(\"Location type is Date and needs to be DateTime\")\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Any)\n    error(\"Input types must be DateTime or Date. $typeof(dt) unsupported \")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[70,267],"elapsed":8.395693333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2092432468,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
