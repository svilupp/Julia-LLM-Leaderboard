Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Define the function and input validation\nFirst, we need to define the function `timezone_bumper` that takes a DateTime object `dt` and an optional integer `bump` with a default value of 3. We will also check if the provided object is indeed a DateTime object to ensure correctness.\n\n## Step 2: Implement the timezone bump logic\nInside the function, we will add the specified number of hours to the DateTime object. Since the DateTime is immutable, we need to create a new DateTime object with the increased hours.\n\n## Step 3: Handle invalid input type (Date instead of DateTime)\nWe need to add a condition to check if the provided object is a DateTime object. If it's not, and specifically if it's a Date object, we should throw an error to indicate the function doesn't work with Date types.\n\n## Step 4: Test the function\nFinally, we will test the function with the provided data to ensure it works as expected.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(TypeError(:timezone_bumper, \"only accepts DateTime\", typeof(dt)))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[184,290],"elapsed":13.700484708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1218094669,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
