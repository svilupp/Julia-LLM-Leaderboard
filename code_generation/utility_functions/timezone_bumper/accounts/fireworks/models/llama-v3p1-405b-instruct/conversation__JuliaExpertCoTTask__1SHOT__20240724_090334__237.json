Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Define the function and input types\nWe need a function `timezone_bumper` that takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` as inputs. The `bump` parameter should default to 3.\n\n## Step 2: Validate the type of the input\n Inside the function, we need to validate that the provided `dt` is indeed of type `DateTime`. If not, we should throw an error.\n\n## Step 3: Provide Date type error\nSpecifically, if the input is of type `Date`, we throw an error as per the task requirements.\n\n## Step 4: Implement the logic to increase the DateTime object\nWe use the `periods` functionality provided by Julia's `Dates` module to add the specified number of hours to the `DateTime` object.\n\n## Step 5: Return the modified DateTime object\nThe function should return the modified `DateTime` object after applying the bump.\n\n## Step 6: Demonstrate the function with the provided data\nWe use the data `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)` to test the function.\n\n## Step 7: Check for incorrect types\nWe also need to ensure that the function works correctly by throwing an error for invalid types like `Date`.\n\n## Step 8: Ensure correct handling of undef or missing\nFinally, we ensure the function handles special cases such as `nothing`, `undef`, or `missing` appropriately.\n\nHere is the code that these steps describe:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This should throw an error\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ErrorException(\"The function works only for DateTime types\"))\nend\n\n# Example\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)\n\n# Throws error for correct type checking\nthrowsany(bool) = bool ?
