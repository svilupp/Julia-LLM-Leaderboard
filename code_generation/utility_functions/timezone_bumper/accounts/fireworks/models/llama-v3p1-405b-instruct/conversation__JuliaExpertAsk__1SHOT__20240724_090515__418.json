If a `Date` type is passed, it throws an error. You can easily extend the definition using any other types as needed.\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function uses `Hour` from `Dates` package to add the `bump` number of hours to the timestamp provided.\n\nIn the examples, you can see that `DateTime` with the timestamp is changed to the next 3 hours of the day while `Date` throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[105,350],"elapsed":13.03682725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-551661449,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
