Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Define the function and input type checks\nFirst, we need to ensure the function only works with DateTime types and throws an error for Date types. We also need to define a function that takes two parameters: a DateTime object and an integer for hours to bump.\n\n## Step 2: Implement the logic to increase the timestamp \nWe need to use the `Hour` Period type in Julia's Dates package to add the specified number of hours to the DateTime object. If no bump is provided, it defaults to +3 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Write the function in Julia\nFollowing the steps outlined, the function will be:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(DomainError(\"Input must be DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Usage\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Usage and verification\nTo check that our solution is correct, we will use the Data provided to see if it gives the expected timestamp. The usage is shown above.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```julia\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[184,283],"elapsed":10.655809833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-268749218,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
