Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper function only works for DateTime types, not Date types.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We specify two methods of the `timezone_bumper` function, one for `DateTime` and one for `Date`.\n- For the `DateTime` method, we simply add `bump` hours to the provided datetime `dt`.\n- For the `Date` method, we throw an error, as this function should not work for `Date` types.\n- Note that the `Hour(bump)` expression is a `Period` type, a type provided by the `Dates` package for representing periods of time. It's used to add a specified number of hours to a `DateTime`.\n- Also note that the `::Int=3` part is how we set the default value for `bump` in Julia.\n\nHere's an example use case:\n\n```julia\ndt = now() # Returns the current DateTime\ndt_bumped = timezone_bumper(dt) # Bumps dt up by 3 hours\ndt_bumped2 = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # Bumps dt up by 5 hours\n\ndt_date = Date(dt) # Returns a Date type\ntry\n    dt_date_bumped = timezone_bumper(dt_date) # Throws an error\ncatch e\n    println(e) # Prints the error message\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `now()` is a function from the `Dates` package that returns the current date and time. We use this to create a `DateTime` object, and then show how to bump this time up by either 3 hours or 5 hours. Finally, we show that the function throws an error when we try to bump a `Date` type up.","status":200,"tokens":[70,417],"elapsed":18.242495625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1480684651,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
