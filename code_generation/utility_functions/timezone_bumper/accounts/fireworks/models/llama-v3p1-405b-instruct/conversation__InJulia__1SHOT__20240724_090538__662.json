Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    error(\"timezone_bumper is only defined for DateTime type. Found a Date type\")\nend\n\n# Testing functions\ndt = DateTime(2022, 14, 15, 0, 0, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt))  # outputs: 2022-02-15T03:00:00\ndt_date = Date(2022, 02, 15)\ntry println(timezone_bumper(dt_date)) \ncatch err println(err) \nend  # outputs: ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper is only defined for DateTime type. Found a Date type\")\n```\n\nIn the code block above, I have written two versions of the `timezone_bumper` function, one for `DateTime` type and one for `Date` type. \n\nWhen you call `timezone_bumper` on a DateTime object, it adds an Hour object to the date with the hour (bump), effectively adding the bump to the hour part of the date (and dealing with cases where adding hours leads to a different day or month).\n\nHowever, if a `Date` type is used, then it throws an error stating that it has been input an incorrect type.\n\nThis function ensures safety by preventing misuse where an invalid `Date` type might be silently converted.\n\nIf you just input the Date version of this function to the function above it throws an error so you need to use a `try-catch` block to catch that error.\n\nAt the end, some test code tries running in both cases once.","status":200,"tokens":[70,368],"elapsed":13.254074167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1412918661,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
