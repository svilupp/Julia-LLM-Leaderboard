To create the `timezone_bumper` function, first, I will check if the input `dt` is of DateTime type. If not, it will throw an error. Then, I will add the `bump` hours to the input DateTime using the `+` operation. If `bump` is not provided, it will default to +3 hours.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt)!= DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n2.
