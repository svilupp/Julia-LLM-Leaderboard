The first method accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `bump` argument. It returns the input `DateTime` increased by the `bump` hours. The second method accepts a `Date` object and also an optional `bump` argument, but it throws a `MethodError` because the `Date` type is not supported by this function.","status":200,"tokens":[104,169],"elapsed":3.131758417,"cost":0.0004368,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-408720892,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
