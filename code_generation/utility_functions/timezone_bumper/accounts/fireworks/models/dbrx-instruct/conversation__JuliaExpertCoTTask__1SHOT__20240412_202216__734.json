Here's how you can define the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    if!(dt isa DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n```\n\nThis should output `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, indicating that the function works correctly.\n\nNote that the function checks if the input is of `DateTime` type and throws an error if it's not. If you try to run `timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))`, you'll get an `ArgumentError` with","status":200,"tokens":[183,200],"elapsed":4.934633792,"cost":0.0006127999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1574827416,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
