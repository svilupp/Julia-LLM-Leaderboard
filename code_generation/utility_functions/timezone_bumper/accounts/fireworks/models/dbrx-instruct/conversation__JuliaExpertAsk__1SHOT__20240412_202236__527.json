It then defines the `timezone_bumper` function that takes in a `dt` argument of type `DateTime` and an optional `bump` argument with a default value of 3. It returns the input `dt` plus the number of hours specified by `bump`.\n\nThe function also includes a method that handles the case where `dt` is of type `Date`. In this case, it throws an `ErrorException` indicating that `timezone_bumper` does not support `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[104,189],"elapsed":3.382765209,"cost":0.00046879999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-200694822,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
