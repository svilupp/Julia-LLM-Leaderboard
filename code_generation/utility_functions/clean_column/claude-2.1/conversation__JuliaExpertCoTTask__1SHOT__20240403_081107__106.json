[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function to clean a column name:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(strip(col))\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\ncol = \"My Column\"\ncleaned = clean_column(col)\nprintln(cleaned) # prints \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Lowercase the column name \n2. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip`\n3. Replace all spaces with underscores using `replace`\n4. Also replace all hyphens with underscores\n\nLet's verify it works on the provided test data:\n\n```julia \ncleaned = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(cleaned) # my_column\n```\n\nThe function handles spaces and hyphens correctly and lowercases the name.
