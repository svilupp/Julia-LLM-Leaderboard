Below is a Julia function named `clean_column` that performs the specified cleaning operations on a column name.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col_cleaned = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col_cleaned = strip(col_cleaned)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col_cleaned = replace(col_cleaned, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col_cleaned\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# println(clean_column(\"My Column\"))      # Output: \"my_column\"\n# println(clean_column(\"Another-Entry \")) # Output: \"another_entry\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The function takes a single argument `col`, which is expected to be a `String`.\n2. It converts the string to lowercase using the `lowercase` function.\n3. It trims any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.\n4. It replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores by using the `replace` function combined with a regular expression `r\"[ -]\"`, which matches both spaces and hyphens.\n5. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name. \n\nFeel free to test the function with different string inputs to see how it works!","status":200,"tokens":[72,265],"elapsed":4.828317583,"cost":0.00016979999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1102786707,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
