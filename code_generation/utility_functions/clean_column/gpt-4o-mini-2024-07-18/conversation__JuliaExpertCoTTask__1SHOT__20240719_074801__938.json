Convert the string to lowercase.\n2. Strip leading and trailing whitespaces.\n3. Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\n### Step 2: Write the function\nWe'll implement the `clean_column` function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Convert to lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\nNow, we'll test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\n# Test the function with the provided example\nresult = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: \"my_column\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\nRunning the test should yield \"my_column\", confirming that the function works as intended.\n\n### Full implementation code\nHere's the complete code with the function and the test.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nresult = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[171,316],"elapsed":4.12215075,"cost":0.00021525,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":107767369,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
