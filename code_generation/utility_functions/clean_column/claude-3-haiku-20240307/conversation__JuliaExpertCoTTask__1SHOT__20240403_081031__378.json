It first converts the column name to lowercase using the `lowercase` function.\n2. Then, it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function.\n3. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function.\n\nThis ensures that the column name is cleaned up as per the requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[180,244],"elapsed":2.374600375,"cost":0.00035000000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
