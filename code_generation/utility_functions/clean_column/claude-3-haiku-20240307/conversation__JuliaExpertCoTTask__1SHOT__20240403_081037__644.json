Think through the approach: We need to lowercase the column name, strip any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n2. Write the necessary functions: We can use the built-in functions `lowercase()`, `strip()`, and `replace()` to achieve the desired cleaning.\n3. Solve the task: Implement the `clean_column()` function using the above steps.\n4. Check the solution: Test the function with the provided data to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[180,269],"elapsed":2.894114125,"cost":0.00038125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20139,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
