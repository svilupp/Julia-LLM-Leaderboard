Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Lowercase the column name\n   - Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n\n2. Write the necessary functions and code:\n   - Implement the `clean_column` function using the `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace` functions.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function takes a column name as input and returns the cleaned column name.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   - The function correctly cleans the example column name \"My Column\" to \"my_column\".\n\nThe function is brief and concise, following the given guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[180,318],"elapsed":3.093872042,"cost":0.0004425,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11128,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
