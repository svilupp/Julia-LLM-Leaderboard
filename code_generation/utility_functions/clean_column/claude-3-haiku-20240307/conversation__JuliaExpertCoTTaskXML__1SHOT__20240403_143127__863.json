It does this by:\n\n1. Calling `lowercase()` to convert the column name to lowercase.\n2. Calling `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n3. Calling `replace()` to replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n\nLet's test it with the example data:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\nThis should return the string `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[214,217],"elapsed":2.585676084,"cost":0.00032475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
