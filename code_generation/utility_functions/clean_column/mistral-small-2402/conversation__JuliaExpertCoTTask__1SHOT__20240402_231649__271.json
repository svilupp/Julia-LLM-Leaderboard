The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` is used to match any whitespace or hyphen characters. The `replace` function then replaces these matched characters with an underscore. The function is tested using Julia's `@assert` macro to ensure it produces the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[188,235],"elapsed":2.579834083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-44376378,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
