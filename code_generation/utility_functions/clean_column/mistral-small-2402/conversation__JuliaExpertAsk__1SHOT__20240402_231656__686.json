The `replace` function takes a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) as its first argument, which matches any whitespace or hyphen characters, and replaces them with an underscore. The result is then passed to `lowercase` and `strip` to lowercase the string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[112,153],"elapsed":1.720010875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1932314850,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
