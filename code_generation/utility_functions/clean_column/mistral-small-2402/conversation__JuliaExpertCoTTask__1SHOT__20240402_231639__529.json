Then it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function. After that, it replaces all spaces and hyphens with an underscore using the `replace()` function with a regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` which matches spaces and hyphens. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[188,240],"elapsed":2.710597041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1249941386,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
