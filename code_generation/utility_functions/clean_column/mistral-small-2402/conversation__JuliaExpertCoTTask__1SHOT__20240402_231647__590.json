We use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, `lowercase` to convert all characters to lowercase, and `replace` with a regular expression to replace all spaces and hyphens with an underscore. We also test the function with the given data to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[188,168],"elapsed":1.900287833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1845189143,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
