When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that implements the specified cleaning process for a column name:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    lowercase(replace(strip(col), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"))\nend\n\n# Test the function\n@show clean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\nWhen run, the output will be:\n\n```\nclean_column(\"My Column\") = \"my_column\"\n```\n\nExplanation of the code:\n1. The `clean_column` function takes an `AbstractString` argument `col`.\n2. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the column name.\n3. The `replace` function with a regex pattern `r\"[\\s-]\"` replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n4. Finally, `lowercase` function transforms the entire cleaned column name to lowercase.\n5. The test case is executed using `@show` macro to display the output.","status":200,"tokens":[188,227],"elapsed":2.513220875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1254150186,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
