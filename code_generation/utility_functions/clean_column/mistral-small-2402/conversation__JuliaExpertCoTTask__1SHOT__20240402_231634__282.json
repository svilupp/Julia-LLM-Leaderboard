Then it removes any leading and trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function. Finally, it uses the `replace()` function with a regular expression to replace any spaces or hyphens with underscores. The function returns the cleaned column name. The test case provided in the task (\"My Column\") is used to verify the correctness of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[188,236],"elapsed":2.648890417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":103989740,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
