It then removes any leading and trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. Finally, it uses the `replace` function with a regular expression to replace all spaces and hyphens with an underscore. The result is returned. A test is included to check that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[188,208],"elapsed":2.325601459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1984774902,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
