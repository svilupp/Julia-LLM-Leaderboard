[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\" |\\-\" => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the input string to lowercase, then stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. After that, it replaces any remaining whitespaces and hyphens with an underscore. The `replace` function is used twice to perform these operations. The first `replace` call removes whitespaces and the second call removes hyphens.\n\nThis solution is efficient and clear, using the Julia standard library for all operations. It emphasizes performance and clarity, and it uses the general type annotation `AbstractString` to allow for multiple dispatch on different string types if necessary. The function is named `clean_column` as per the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[378,182],"elapsed":1.362184625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":287683696,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
