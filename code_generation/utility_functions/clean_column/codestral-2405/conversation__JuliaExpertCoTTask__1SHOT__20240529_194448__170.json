It applies three transformations to `col`: it converts it to lowercase, removes leading or trailing whitespaces, and replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores. The function then returns the cleaned string. The last line is a test to ensure that the function is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[188,142],"elapsed":1.073657333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":877537264,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
