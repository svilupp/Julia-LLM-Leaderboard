It then applies three transformations:\n1. `lowercase`: Converts all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase.\n2. `strip`: Removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string.\n3. `replace`: Replaces any occurrence of spaces or hyphens with an underscore.\n\nThe function returns the transformed string. In the given example, the input \"My Column\" would be transformed to \"my_column\".","status":200,"tokens":[188,164],"elapsed":1.222499292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1262474214,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
