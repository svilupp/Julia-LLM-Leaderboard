It lowercases the string using the `lowercase` function, then removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. Finally, it uses the `replace` function to replace any occurrences of spaces or hyphens with underscores, using a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]+\"`) to match one or more spaces or hyphens. The result is the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[112,149],"elapsed":1.108160709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1756951154,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
