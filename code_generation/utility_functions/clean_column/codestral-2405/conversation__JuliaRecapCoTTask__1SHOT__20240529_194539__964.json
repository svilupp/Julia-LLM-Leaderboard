[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThe `clean_column` function takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase, removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and finally replaces any remaining spaces or hyphens with an underscore. The function uses Julia's built-in string manipulation functions to perform these operations, such as `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace`. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` matches any whitespace or hyphen character.\n\nThis solution follows the best practices for the Julia language, using standard library functions for string manipulation and avoiding unnecessary imports or packages. The function is also generalized to work with any `AbstractString` type, allowing it to be used with a variety of string-like objects in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[380,246],"elapsed":1.785989709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2041579986,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
