[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input, lowercases it, strips any leading or trailing whitespaces, and then replaces all spaces and hyphens with an underscore. The `replace` function is used with a regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` to match all spaces and hyphens, and the replacement string `\"_\"` is passed as the second argument. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, and the `lowercase` function is used to convert all characters to lowercase. The resulting cleaned column name is returned as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[378,165],"elapsed":1.215453959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1159464188,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
