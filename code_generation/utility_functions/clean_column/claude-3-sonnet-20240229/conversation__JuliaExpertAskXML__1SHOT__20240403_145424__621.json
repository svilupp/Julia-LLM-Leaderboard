It performs the following operations:\n\n1. `strip(col)` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input string.\n2. `replace(strip(col), r\"[-\\s]+\" => \"_\")` replaces any occurrence of hyphens (`-`) or spaces (`\\s`) with an underscore (`_`). The regular expression `r\"[-\\s]+\"` matches one or more consecutive hyphens or spaces.\n3. `lowercase(...)` converts the resulting string to lowercase.\n\nThe cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[116,200],"elapsed":4.596961291,"cost":0.0033480000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23644,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
