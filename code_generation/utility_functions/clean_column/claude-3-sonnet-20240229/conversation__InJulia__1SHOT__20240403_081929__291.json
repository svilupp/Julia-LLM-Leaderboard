The regular expression `r\"[- ]\"` matches any character that is a space or a hyphen.\n4. The cleaned string is then returned.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\" Hyphen-Separated \")\n\"hyphen_separated\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"MixedCase With Spaces\")\n\"mixedcase_with_spaces\"\n```\n\nNote that the `clean_column` function expects an `AbstractString` as input, which means it will work with any string type in Julia, such as `String` or `SubString`.","status":200,"tokens":[74,317],"elapsed":5.835514959,"cost":0.0049770000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1101,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
