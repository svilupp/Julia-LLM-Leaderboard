Below is a simple Julia function named `clean_column` that takes a string representing a column name (`col`) and performs the cleaning tasks as described:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    clean_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    clean_col = strip(clean_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    clean_col = replace(clean_col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return clean_col\nend\n```\n\nHere's how each part of the function works:\n- `lowercase(col)`: Converts all characters in the string `col` to lowercase.\n- `strip(clean_col)`: Removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string `clean_col`.\n- `replace(clean_col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")`: Replaces all occurrences of spaces (denoted by `\\s` in the regex) and hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`_`). The plus sign (`+`) in the regex ensures that if there are multiple spaces or hyphens consecutively, they will be replaced by just one underscore.\n\nYou can use this function to clean any given column name as follows:\n\n```julia\ncol_name = \"  My Column-Example \"\nclean_name = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(clean_name)  # Output will be \"my_column_example\"\n```\n\nThis function simplifies column names to a consistent format that is often used in data processing and storage, making them easier to handle programmatically.","status":200,"tokens":[72,322],"elapsed":7.021594667,"cost":0.01038,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":743917739,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
