When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, the function `clean_column` will:\n\n1. Lowercase the string `col`.\n2. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n3. Replace spaces (`\" \"`) with underscores (`\"_\"`).\n4. Replace hyphens (`\"-\"`) with underscores (`\"_\"`).\n\nUsing the Python `str` methods `lower`, `strip`, and `replace` will accomplish this.\n\n## Function Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    clean = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace\n    clean = strip(clean)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    clean = replace(clean, \" \" => \"_\")\n    clean = replace(clean, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return clean\nend\n```\n\nThis function will be succinct and handle the transformations as outlined for the task.\n\n## Test Cases\n\n```julia\n# Test with various examples\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Expected: \"my_column\"\nprintln(clean_column(\" Column-Name \"))  # Expected: \"column_name\"\nprintln(clean_column(\"column_data \"))  # Expected: \"column_data\"\nprintln(clean_column(\"A-B-C\"))  # Expected: \"a_b_c\"\nprintln(clean_column(\"-Leading and trailing-\"))  # Expected: \"_leading_and_trailing_\"\n```\n\nThe steps are systematically implemented in the Julia function, and the transformation and cleaning process is adhered to as described.","status":200,"tokens":[170,308],"elapsed":8.170587458,"cost":0.01094,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":40409835,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
