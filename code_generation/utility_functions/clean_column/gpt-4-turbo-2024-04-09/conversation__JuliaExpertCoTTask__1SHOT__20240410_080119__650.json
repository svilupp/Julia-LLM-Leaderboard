Convert the entire string to lowercase.\n2. Strip leading and trailing whitespace characters.\n3. Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\nThe final function will use built-in string manipulation functions to achieve this. Let's implement the function.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Step 1: Lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Step 2: Strip whitespace\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Step 3: Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the correctness of the function by running several test cases based on the example provided.\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Expected: \"my_column\"\nprintln(clean_column(\" Some-Data \"))  # Expected: \"some_data\"\nprintln(clean_column(\"ANOTHERCOLUMN\"))  # Expected: \"anothercolumn\"\nprintln(clean_column(\" Data WITH--unexpected symbols\\t\\n \"))  # Expected: \"data_with__unexpected_symbols\"\n```\n\nThis code should modify the provided column strings according to the specified rules.","status":200,"tokens":[170,266],"elapsed":7.509962667,"cost":0.009680000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1501853634,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
