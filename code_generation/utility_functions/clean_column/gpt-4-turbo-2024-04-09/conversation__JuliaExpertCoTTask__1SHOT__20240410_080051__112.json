Convert the entire string `col` to lowercase using the `.lower()` method.\n2. Use `.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing spaces.\n3. Use `.replace()` to substitute spaces and hyphens with underscores. Since `.replace()` operates only with one type of character at a time, perform it twice: first for spaces, then for hyphens.\n\n## Coding the Function:\n\nNow I'll write the `clean_column` function adhering to this approach.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)::String\n    step1 = lowercase(col)\n    step2 = strip(step1)\n    step3 = replace(step2, ' ' => '_')\n    step4 = replace(step3, '-' => '_')\n    return step4\nend\n```\n\n## Example Test:\n\nTo check the solution, let's run it for the given data.\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Should output 'my_column'\n```\n\nThrough this sequence, the function addresses each aspect of column name cleaning as outlined.","status":200,"tokens":[170,226],"elapsed":6.308826209,"cost":0.008480000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1970524083,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
