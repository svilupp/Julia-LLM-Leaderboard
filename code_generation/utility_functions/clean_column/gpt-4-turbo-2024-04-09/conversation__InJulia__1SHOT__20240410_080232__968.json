Below is a function `clean_column` that takes a single string `col` as input and returns the cleaned column name based on your specifications:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the entire string\n    clean_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespace\n    clean_col = strip(clean_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    clean_col = replace(clean_col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return clean_col\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to clean up column names as described:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\ncolumn_name = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name: \", cleaned_name)  # Output: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression, `[\\s-]+`, in the `replace` method. This expression matches one or more occurrences of any whitespace character (`\\s`) or hyphens (`-`), which are then replaced with underscores (`_`). This ensures all spaces and hyphens are converted properly, even when they appear consecutively in the original string.","status":200,"tokens":[72,278],"elapsed":6.486882709,"cost":0.00906,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-323447777,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
