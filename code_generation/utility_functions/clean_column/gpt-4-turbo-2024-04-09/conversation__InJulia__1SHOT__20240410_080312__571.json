Here's how you could write the `clean_column` function in Julia to perform the described transformations:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the input string\n    clean_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces\n    clean_col = strip(clean_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    clean_col = replace(clean_col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return clean_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a column name as a string, processes it according to the specified steps, and returns the cleaned column name. Here's a breakdown of each step:\n\n1. **Lowercase**: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase to ensure consistency.\n2. **Strip**: Removes any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.\n3. **Replace**: Changes any occurrence of a space or a hyphen to an underscore. The regular expression `[ -]` matches both spaces and hyphens, which are then replaced with `_` using the `replace` function.\n\nUsing this function would look like this:\n\n```julia\noriginal_col = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_col = clean_column(original_col)\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name:\", cleaned_col)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nCleaned column name: my_column_name\n```","status":200,"tokens":[72,277],"elapsed":8.680853417,"cost":0.00903,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2070803351,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
