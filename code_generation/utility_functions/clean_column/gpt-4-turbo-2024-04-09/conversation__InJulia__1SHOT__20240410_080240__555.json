The function takes a column name as a string, processes it, and returns the cleaned version of the string.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Step 1: Lowercase the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Step 2: Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Step 3: Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ncolumn_name = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprintln(cleaned_name)  # Output will be: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\n**Explanation of the function:**\n1. **Lowercase**: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n2. **Strip**: Removes any spaces or extraneous whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.\n3. **Replace**: Uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of spaces (denoted by `\\s`) and hyphens (`-`). These characters are replaced with underscores (`_`). The `+` in the regular expression allows for replacing multiple consecutive spaces or hyphens with a single underscore.\n\nThis function should handle typical cases needed for cleaning up column names in data processing tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[72,291],"elapsed":8.251430375,"cost":0.00945,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":146045690,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
