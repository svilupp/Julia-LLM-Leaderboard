Hereâ€™s how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Convert to lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing white spaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this function, you can pass a column name as a string:\n\n```julia\nnew_column_name = clean_column(\" My Column-Name \")\nprintln(new_column_name)  # Output: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. `lowercase(col)` converts all characters in the string `col` to lowercase.\n2. `strip(col)` removes any leading and trailing spaces from `col`.\n3. `replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")` uses a regular expression to find all spaces and hyphens and replaces them with underscores. Note that `r\"[ -]\"` is a regex pattern that matches both spaces and hyphens because of the character class `[ -]`.\n\nThis setup ensures that your column names are formatted consistently, helping with data processing tasks where uniform column names might be important (e.g., when working with databases or data frames).","status":200,"tokens":[72,298],"elapsed":7.736840875,"cost":0.00966,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-175919254,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
