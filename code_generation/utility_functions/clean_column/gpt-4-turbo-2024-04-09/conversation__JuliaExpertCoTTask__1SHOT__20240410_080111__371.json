[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, the function `clean_column` needs to:\n1. Convert the entire string `col` to lowercase using the `lowercase` function.\n2. Trim any leading or trailing whitespace with the `strip` function.\n3. Replace any spaces (' ') and hyphens ('-') with underscores ('_'). This can be achieved by chaining the `replace` function.\n\nNow, let's implement and test this approach.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Convert to lowercase\n    col_modified = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading or trailing whitespace\n    col_modified = strip(col_modified)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col_modified = replace(col_modified, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col_modified = replace(col_modified, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col_modified\nend\n\n# Test the function with provided example\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # Should print \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis function should perform the transformations step-by-step as described, ensuring accurate processing of input strings into cleaned column names. The `replace` function is applied twice to cover both spaces and hyphens efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[170,238],"elapsed":8.122240875,"cost":0.00884,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1302371742,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
