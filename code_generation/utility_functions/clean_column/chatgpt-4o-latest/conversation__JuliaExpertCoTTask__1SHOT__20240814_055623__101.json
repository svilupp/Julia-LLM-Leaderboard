Lowercase the entire string.\n2. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n3. Replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore.\n\n### Step 2: Write the function `clean_column`\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    col = lowercase(col)                      # Lowercase the string\n    col = strip(col)                          # Strip leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")        # Replace spaces and hyphens with \"_\"\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test the function with the provided data\n\n```julia\ncleaned_col = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(cleaned_col)  # Expected output: \"my_column\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n\nResult: `clean_column(\"My Column\")` produces `\"my_column\"`, which meets the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[171,201],"elapsed":2.634557042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1858330681,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
