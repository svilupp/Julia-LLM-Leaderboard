It then removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip`. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace`. The cleaned column name is then returned. When you run this code with the provided data, the output will be `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[173,159],"elapsed":0.890857708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":271706283,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
