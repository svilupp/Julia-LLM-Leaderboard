Think through the approach step by step:\n\t* Lowercase the column name\n\t* Strip leading or trailing whitespaces\n\t* Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n2. Write the functions and other code needed:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    res = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading or trailing whitespaces\n    res = strip(res)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    res = replace(res, [' ' => '_', '-' => '_'])\n    return res\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\nApply the function to the clean_column name to get the result:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Expected: my_column\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nRun the code with the example and verify the answer:\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Check if returns \"my_column\"\n``` \n\nAlways test it with couple of examples. Here cleaning couple more : \n\nprintln(clean_column(\" Another  Column\")) \nprintln(clean_column(\"My-Best Column\")) # Added extra check \n\nReturn is as per task, so that's correct.","status":200,"tokens":[173,260],"elapsed":9.214306334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":852394767,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
