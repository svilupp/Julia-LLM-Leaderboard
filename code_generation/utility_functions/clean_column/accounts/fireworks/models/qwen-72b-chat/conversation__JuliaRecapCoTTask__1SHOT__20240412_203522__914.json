[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    lowercase strip(replace(replace(col, r\"\\s+\" => \"_\"), r\"-+\" => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nThe `clean_column` function takes the input `col` as a string and applies a series of string manipulations to transform the input column name to a cleaned version.\nThe first step is to use the `lowercase` function to convert all characters in the string to lowercase.\nThe second step is to use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces in the string.\nThe third step is to use the `replace` function twice to replace any spaces and hyphens in the string with an underscore. The regular expressions `r\"\\s+\"` and `r\"-+\"` are used to match one or more consecutive spaces and hyphens, respectively.\nThe result of these combine steps is the cleaned column name.\n# Test the Solution\n```julia\ncol","status":200,"tokens":[333,200],"elapsed":3.96583725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-177613667,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
