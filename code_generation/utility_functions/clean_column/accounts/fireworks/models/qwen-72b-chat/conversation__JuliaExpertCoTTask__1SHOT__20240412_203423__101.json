First, I will lowercase the column name using the `lower` method. Then, I will strip any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` method. Next, I will replace any spaces in the column name with an underscore using the `replace` method. Finally, I will replace any hyphens in the column name with an underscore using the `rreplace` method. This will ensure that the column name is cleaned and ready to be used as a valid identifier in a Julia program.\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lower(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col = rreplace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nI will now test the function with the given example to check if it produces","status":200,"tokens":[172,200],"elapsed":3.819373667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":319201373,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
