[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow the provided special instructions. Here's the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n\n    # Lowercase the column name and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = lowercase(strip(col))\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a column name as a string, replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, lowercases the column name, and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input type is annotated as `AbstractString` to allow any string-like type, and the output type is automatically inferred as `String`. The special instructions provided by the user are prioritized over the general guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[332,170],"elapsed":4.951424291,"cost":0.0008032,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1786398215,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
