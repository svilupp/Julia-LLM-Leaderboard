X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. Based on the problem solving steps and the guidelines provided, here's how you can write the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets:\n\n* To convert a string to lowercase, we can use the `lowercase` function.\n* To remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string, we can use the `strip` function.\n* To replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore, we can use the `replace` function.\n\nNow, let's solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Convert the column name to lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, ' ' => '_')\n    col = replace(col, '-' => '_')\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nFinally, let's","status":200,"tokens":[331,200],"elapsed":3.817561459,"cost":0.0008495999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1180554361,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
