Think through your approach step by step:\n* The function needs to take a string as input and return a modified string as output.\n* The modifications required are lowercasing, stripping leading/trailing whitespaces, and replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n* The function `clean_column` is written to clean a column name according to the requirements.\n\n4.
