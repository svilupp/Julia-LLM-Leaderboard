Think through the approach step by step:\n\n   - To clean a column name, we need to perform the following operations:\n     - Convert the column name to lowercase.\n     - Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n     - Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n   Here's the `clean_column` function that implements the above steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n   Call the `clean_column` function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\n   Verify the output of the `clean_column` function:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"","status":200,"tokens":[172,200],"elapsed":3.641058083,"cost":0.0005951999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":906326632,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
