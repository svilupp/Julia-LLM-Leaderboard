The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. The `lowercase` function is then used to convert all the characters in the string to lowercase. Finally, the `replace` function is used with a regular expression `r\" |-|\"` to replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore. The regular expression `r\" |-|\"` matches any space or hyphen character. The resulting string is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[109,144],"elapsed":2.695546208,"cost":0.0004048,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-526050704,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
