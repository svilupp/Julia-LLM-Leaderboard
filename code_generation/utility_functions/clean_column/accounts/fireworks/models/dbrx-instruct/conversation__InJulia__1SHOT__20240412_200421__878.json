Here's how you can define the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    col = lowercase(col)  # lowercasing the string\n    col = strip(col)  # removing leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")  # replacing spaces with underscores\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")  # replacing hyphens with underscores\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input (in this case, a column name), lowercases it, removes any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore. The cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[74,161],"elapsed":2.943135,"cost":0.000376,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-136248403,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
