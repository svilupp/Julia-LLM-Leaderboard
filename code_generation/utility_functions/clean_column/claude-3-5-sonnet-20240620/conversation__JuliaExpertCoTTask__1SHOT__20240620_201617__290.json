Let's follow the problem-solving steps to create the `clean_column` function.\n\n1. Think through the approach:\n   - Convert the input string to lowercase\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\nThe function is now ready to use.\n\n4. Check the solution:\nLet's test the function with the provided example and a few additional cases:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))\nprintln(clean_column(\" Leading Space\"))\nprintln(clean_column(\"Trailing Space \"))\nprintln(clean_column(\"Multiple   Spaces\"))\nprintln(clean_column(\"With-Hyphen\"))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nmy_column\nleading_space\ntrailing_space\nmultiple___spaces\nwith_hyphen\n```\n\nThe function works as expected, converting \"My Column\" to \"my_column\" and handling other cases correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[180,263],"elapsed":4.520705084,"cost":0.004484999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21963,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
