Here's a Julia function that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Convert to lowercase\n    cleaned = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    cleaned = strip(cleaned)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    cleaned = replace(cleaned, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return cleaned\nend\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes an input `col` of type `AbstractString`, which allows it to work with various string types in Julia.\n\n2. It converts the input to lowercase using the `lowercase()` function.\n\n3. It removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function.\n\n4. It uses the `replace()` function with a regular expression `r\"[\\s-]\"` to replace any whitespace character (`\\s`) or hyphen (`-`) with an underscore (`_`).\n\n5. Finally, it returns the cleaned string.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\noriginal_column = \"  My Column Name - with Spaces  \"\ncleaned_column = clean_column(original_column)\nprintln(cleaned_column)  # Output: \"my_column_name_with_spaces\"\n```\n\nThis function will handle various cases, such as:\n\n- \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\"\n- \"First-Name\" becomes \"first_name\"\n- \" Title \" becomes \"title\"\n- \"LAST NAME\" becomes \"last_name\"\n\nThe function is concise and efficient, leveraging Julia's built-in string manipulation functions.","status":200,"tokens":[74,388],"elapsed":5.253640917,"cost":0.0060420000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
