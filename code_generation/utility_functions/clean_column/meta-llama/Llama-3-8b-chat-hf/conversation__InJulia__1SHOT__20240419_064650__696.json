The `r` prefix indicates that the string is a raw string literal, which allows us to use backslashes (`\\`) without escaping them.\n* `_` : This is the replacement string, which is an underscore (`_`).\n\nYou can test this function with the example you provided:\n```\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
