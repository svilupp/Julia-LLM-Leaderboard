[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a column name as a string, converts it to lowercase, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores. The regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` matches any space or hyphen.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"Another-Column\")\n\"another_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\" Leading and Trailing Spaces \")\n\"leading_and_trailing_spaces\"\n```\n\nThis function will work with any string, not just column names. It will return an empty string if the input is an empty string. If the input is not a string, it will throw a `MethodError`.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle special characters or numbers in the column name. If you need to handle those, you will need to modify the regular expression and possibly add additional steps to the function.\n\nAlso, this function does not handle multiple consecutive spaces or hyphens. If you need to handle those, you can modify the regular expression to `r\"[ -]+\"`. This will replace one or more consecutive spaces or hyphens with a single underscore.\n\nIf you have any special instructions, please let me know and I will update the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[389,422],"elapsed":13.763898792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1276658853,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
