The approach is to lowercase the column name, strip leading and trailing whitespaces, and replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n2. The function `clean_column` is written to implement this approach.\n3. The task is solved by calling this function with the column name as an argument.\n4. The solution is checked by printing the output of the function and verifying that it matches the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[197,251],"elapsed":7.129876083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":488725161,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
