Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Lowercase the column name\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n\n2. Write the function and other code needed:\n   - The function `clean_column` is defined with the input parameter `col`.\n   - The function uses the `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace` functions from the Julia standard library.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - The function `clean_column` is called with the input \"My Column\".\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n   - The output \"my_column\" is printed to the console, which matches the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[197,319],"elapsed":24.877919,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-627847799,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
