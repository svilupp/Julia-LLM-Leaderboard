The `replace` function takes three arguments: the string to modify, a regular expression pattern to search for, and a replacement string. In this case, the regular expression pattern `r\"[ -]\"` matches any space or hyphen, and the replacement string is `\"_\"`.\n\nThe cleaned column name is then returned as the result of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[121,235],"elapsed":7.259309333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-230809712,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
