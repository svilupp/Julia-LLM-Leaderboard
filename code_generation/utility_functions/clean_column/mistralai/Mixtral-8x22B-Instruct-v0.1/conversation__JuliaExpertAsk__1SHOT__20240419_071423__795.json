Then, it uses the `lowercase` function to convert the string to lowercase. Finally, it uses the `replace` function to replace any spaces or hyphens in the string with an underscore. The `r\"[ -]\"` is a regular expression that matches either a space or a hyphen.","status":200,"tokens":[121,144],"elapsed":13.230626,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-479084152,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
