[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write the `clean_column` function in Julia. Based on your task description, here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    return lowercase(replace(strip(col), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this function does:\n\n1. `lowercase(col)`: This converts the string to lowercase.\n2. `strip(col)`: This removes any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n3. `replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")`: This replaces any spaces or hyphens with an underscore. The `r\"[\\s-]\"` is a regular expression that matches any whitespace character (`\\s`) or a hyphen (`-`).\n\nPlease note that this function uses Julia's standard library and follows the guidelines you provided. It uses the `AbstractString` type annotation to be as general as possible, and it should be quite performant.\n\nAs for the special instructions, you didn't provide any, so I followed the general guidelines. If you have any specific instructions, feel free to share them, and I'll adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[380,299],"elapsed":7.653990417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":891668808,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
