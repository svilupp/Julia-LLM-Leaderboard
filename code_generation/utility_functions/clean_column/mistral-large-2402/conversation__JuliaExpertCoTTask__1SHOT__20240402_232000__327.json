Here's how I would approach this task in Julia:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Lowercase the input string\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col_lower = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col_stripped = strip(col_lower)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col_clean = replace(col_stripped, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col_clean\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `clean_column` now implements the required cleanup steps.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n\n```julia\n@assert clean_column(\"My Column\") == \"my_column\"\n@assert clean_column(\" My-Column \") == \"my_column\"\n@assert clean_column(\"MyColumn\") == \"mycolumn\"\n```\n\nThe `@assert` macro will throw an error if the function does not return the expected output, so if no errors are thrown, the function is working as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[188,328],"elapsed":8.736932625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1324862067,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
