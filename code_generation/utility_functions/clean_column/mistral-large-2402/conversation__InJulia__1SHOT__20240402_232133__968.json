Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    lower_col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    stripped_col = strip(lower_col)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    cleaned_col = replace(stripped_col, r\"[- ]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return cleaned_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input, lowercases it, removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and then replaces any spaces or hyphens with an underscore. You can call this function with a column name to clean it according to your specifications. For example, `clean_column(\"My Column\")` would return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,206],"elapsed":4.99008925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1306883110,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
