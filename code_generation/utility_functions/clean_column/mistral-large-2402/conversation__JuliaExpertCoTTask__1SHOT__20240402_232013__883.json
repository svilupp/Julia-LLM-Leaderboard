Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe function `clean_column` when applied to \"My Column\" should return \"my_column\". You can manually check this by running the function.","status":200,"tokens":[188,230],"elapsed":5.539227083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-113272508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
