Here's how I would approach this task in Julia:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Lowercase the string\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col_lower = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col_stripped = strip(col_lower)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col_clean = replace(col_stripped, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col_clean\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n\nThe function `clean_column` now implements the required functionality.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\n@assert clean_column(\"My Column\") == \"my_column\"\n```\n\nIf the function is working correctly, the assertion will pass without any errors. If there's a mismatch, Julia will throw an error, indicating that the function needs to be adjusted.","status":200,"tokens":[188,312],"elapsed":7.413522833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1719173718,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
