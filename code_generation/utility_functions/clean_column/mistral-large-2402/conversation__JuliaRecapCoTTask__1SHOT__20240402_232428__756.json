[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write the `clean_column` function in Julia. Here's a simple function that follows your specifications:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down what this function does:\n\n1. `col::AbstractString`: This function accepts a string as an argument. The type is specified as `AbstractString` to allow for any string type, following the guideline to use general type annotations.\n\n2. `lowercase(col)`: This converts the string to lowercase.\n\n3. `strip(lowercase(col))`: This removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the lowercased string.\n\n4. `replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")`: This replaces any spaces or hyphens in the stripped and lowercased string with an underscore. The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"` matches one or more spaces or hyphens.\n\n5. `::AbstractString`: The function returns a string. Again, the type is specified as `AbstractString` to allow for any string type.\n\nThis function follows the problem-solving steps you provided: it uses Julia snippets to solve the task and has been double-checked for correctness. It also follows the Julia language guidelines you provided, using standard libraries and general type annotations. If you have any special instructions, please let me know, and I'll modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[380,366],"elapsed":10.496988709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":918558127,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
