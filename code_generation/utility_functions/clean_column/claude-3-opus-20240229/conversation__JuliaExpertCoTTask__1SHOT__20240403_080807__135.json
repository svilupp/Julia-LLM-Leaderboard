[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided.

Approach:\n   - Lowercase the column name\n   - Strip leading/trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n\n2. Function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Test the function:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\n4. The solution is correct. It follows the specified steps to clean the column name:\n   - Lowercases \"My Column\" to \"my column\"\n   - Strips any leading/trailing whitespaces (not applicable in this case)\n   - Replaces the space with an underscore, resulting in \"my_column\"\n\nThe function handles the given example correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[180,258],"elapsed":11.729348583,"cost":0.02205,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18118,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
