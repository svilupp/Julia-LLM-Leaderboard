It converts the column name to lowercase using the `lowercase` function.\n\n2. It removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function.\n\n3. It replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace` function. The `replace` function is called twice, once to replace spaces with underscores and again to replace hyphens with underscores.\n\n4. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name.\n\nHere are a few examples of how the `clean_column` function works:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"  Another-Column \")\n\"another_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"ThirdColumn\")\n\"thirdcolumn\"\n```\n\nIn the first example, \"My Column\" is converted to \"my_column\" by lowercasing, removing spaces, and replacing them with underscores.\n\nIn the second example, \"  Another-Column \" is cleaned by removing the leading and trailing spaces, lowercasing, and replacing the hyphen with an underscore.\n\nIn the third example, \"ThirdColumn\" is simply lowercased since it doesn't contain any spaces or hyphens.\n\nThis function provides a convenient way to clean and standardize column names in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[74,441],"elapsed":16.160032541,"cost":0.034185,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25118,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
