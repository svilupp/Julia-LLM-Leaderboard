The function takes a column name `col` as an `AbstractString` (which includes `String`).\n2. It first lowercases the column name using `lowercase(col)`.\n3. Then it strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip(cleaned)`.\n4. Finally, it replaces any spaces or hyphens with an underscore using `replace(cleaned, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")`. The regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` matches any space or hyphen character.\n5. The cleaned column name is returned.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\" Another-Column \")\n\"another_column\"\n```\n\nThe function handles the specified requirements of lowercasing, stripping whitespaces, and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores in a concise and efficient manner.","status":200,"tokens":[111,290],"elapsed":12.690539542,"cost":0.023415,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31741,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
