It takes a column name `col` as an input, which should be an `AbstractString` (e.g., `String`).\n\n2. It applies the `lowercase()` function to convert the column name to lowercase.\n\n3. It uses the `strip()` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name.\n\n4. It uses the `replace()` function with a regular expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"` to replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore (`_`). The regular expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"` matches one or more occurrences of whitespace characters (`\\s`) or hyphens (`-`).\n\n5. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name.\n\nHere are a few examples of how the function works:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"Another-Column\")\n\"another_column\"\n\njulia> clean_column(\"  spaces and    hyphens - here  \")\n\"spaces_and_hyphens_here\"\n```\n\nThe function ensures that the column name is cleaned according to the specified rules, making it suitable for use as a valid column name in various data processing and analysis tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[111,367],"elapsed":14.975471333,"cost":0.029189999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27184,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
