Approach:\n   - Lowercase the column name \n   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n\n2. Function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Test:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n```\n\n4. Verification:\n\nThe `clean_column` function does the following:\n- Converts the column name to lowercase using `lowercase()`\n- Removes leading/trailing whitespace using `strip()`\n- Replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscore using `replace()` with a regular expression\n\nSo for the given example:\n- \"My Column\" is lowercased to \"my column\"\n- No leading/trailing spaces to strip\n- The space is replaced by underscore resulting in \"my_column\"\n\nTherefore, the function works as expected and the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[180,255],"elapsed":12.028286166,"cost":0.021825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-32137,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
