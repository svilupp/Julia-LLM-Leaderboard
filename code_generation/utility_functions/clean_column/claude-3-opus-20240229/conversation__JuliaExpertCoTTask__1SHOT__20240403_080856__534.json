The function takes a column name `col` as a string argument.\n2. We first convert the column name to lowercase using `lowercase(col)`.\n3. Then we strip any leading or trailing whitespaces using `strip()`.\n4. We use `replace()` with a regular expression `r\"[ -]\"` to match any spaces or hyphens and replace them with an underscore `\"_\"`.\n5. Finally, we return the cleaned column name.\n\nLet's test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")\n# Output: \"my_column\"\n```\n\nIt works as expected. The function cleans the column name by lowercasing it, removing any leading/trailing whitespaces, and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores.","status":200,"tokens":[180,249],"elapsed":10.016533292,"cost":0.021374999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31223,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
