X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), append `\"way\"` to the end.\n2. If a word starts with a consonant, move all the consonant letters before the first vowel to the end and then append `\"ay\"`.\n\n#### Steps to Approach:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:**\n   - For parallel processing, utilize `Threads.threadid()`, `Threads.@threads` for threading, which is the most straightforward way to achieve parallel processing in Julia.\n   - String manipulation functions like checking if a character is in a list of vowels: `in(char, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])`.\n   - Regular expression might be handy in identifying consonants before the first vowel.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n   - Create the `pig_latinify` function.\n   - Implement the rules for pig latin transformation using an appropriate methodology to identify vowels and consonants.\n   - Parallelize the operation using `Threads.@threads` for iterating over the vector of strings.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**:\n   - Ensure the string outputs follow pig latin rules.\n   - Check for edge cases including empty strings and strings with no vowels.\n\nLet's create the solution taking into account Julia's capabilities and threading for efficient computation.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    # Function to convert a single word to pig latin\n    function to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])\n        first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c âˆˆ vowels, word)\n\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_idx)\n            # No vowels, pig latin form is not generally defined, but let's just return the word + \"ay\"\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        elseif first_vowel_idx == 1\n            # Vowel is the first character\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Consonant starts the word\n            # Split the word around the first vowel\n            prefix = word[1:first_vowel_idx-1]\n            suffix = word[first_vowel_idx:end]\n            return suffix * prefix * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Array to store the transformed words\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    # Use thread parallel processing to handle each word\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        transformed_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation leverages threading to apply a pig latin conversion to each word in the vector separately, which can optimize performance for large arrays of strings. The `to_pig_latin` is a helper function defined within `pig_latinify` to encapsulate the pig latin transformation logic. Each thread processes a subset of the array, enhancing the function's efficiency on multi-core systems.","status":200,"tokens":[321,659],"elapsed":25.408930625,"cost":0.02298,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1165275127,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
