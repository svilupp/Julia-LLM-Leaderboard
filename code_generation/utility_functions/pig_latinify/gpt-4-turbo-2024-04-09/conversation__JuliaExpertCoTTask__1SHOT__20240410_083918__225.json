If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" at the end.\n2. If a word starts with one or more consonants, move all the consonant letters from the beginning of the word up to the first vowel to the end of the word, then add \"ay\".\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the transformation rules**:\n   - Check if the first letter is a vowel.\n   - If yes, append \"way\".\n   - If no, find the position of the first vowel, then rearrange and append \"ay\".\n   \n2. **Write a function pig_latinify**:\n   - This will accept a vector of strings.\n   - Iterate over each string and apply the transformation rules.\n   \n3. **Parallelize using Threads**:\n   - Each word transformation will be done in a separate thread.\n   - Collect results synchronously to avoid data races.\n   \n4. **Return the transformed array.**\n\n## Writing the Code:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction transform_to_pig_latin(word::String) :: String\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    idx_first_vowel = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n    \n    if idx_first_vowel === nothing\n        return word  # No vowel found, unlikely but handling just in case.\n    end\n    \n    if idx_first_vowel == 1\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[idx_first_vowel:end] * word[1:idx_first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n   \n    @sync begin\n        for i in 1:n\n            @async begin\n                results[i] = transform_to_pig_latin(words[i])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example use case as per the given task\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function handles the multi-threading using Juliaâ€™s `Threads` library, and each word is transformed on a separate thread to benefit from parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[170,504],"elapsed":17.799126833,"cost":0.01682,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":389697764,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
