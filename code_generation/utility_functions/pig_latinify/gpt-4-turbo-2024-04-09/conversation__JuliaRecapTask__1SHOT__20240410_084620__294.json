X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Understand how to convert a single word into pig latin:\n   - For words beginning with a consonant, move the starting consonant(s) to the end and add 'ay'. For example, \"Hello\" becomes \"Ellohay\".\n   - If a word starts with a vowel, simply add \"ay\" at the end. For example, \"apple\" becomes \"appleay\".\n\n2. Implement the transformation logic in a separate function.\n\n3. Implement the `pig_latinify` function to handle a vector of strings:\n   - Use Julia's threading feature to process each string in a separate thread.\n\n4. Multithreaded processing:\n   - Use the `@threads` macro to create a thread for each transformation. This macro splits the work across available threads.\n   - Gather the results together from each thread.\n\nNow, let's go through the implementation using Julia's capabilities.\n\n#### Step 1: Write Pig Latin Converter Function\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if lowercase(word[i]) in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * lowercase(word[1:i-1]) * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # Handle edge cases where no vowels are present\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Implement the `Pig_latinify` Function to Work on Vector of Strings\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        transformed_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nBy using `@threads`, the execution of `to_pig_latin` for each word in the array can potentially run on different threads, depending on the number of available threads on your system. The results are collected in `transformed_words` vector. Note that threading will improve performance particularly for large collections of words, assuming a multicore Julia setup.","status":200,"tokens":[320,529],"elapsed":12.392950625,"cost":0.01907,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-980996964,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
