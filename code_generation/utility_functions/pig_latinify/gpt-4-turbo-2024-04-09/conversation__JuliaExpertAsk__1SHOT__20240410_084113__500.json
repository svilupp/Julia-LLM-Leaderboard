For each string, it applies the `to_pig_latin` function running each conversion in parallel using multiple threads (`@threads for` loop).\n3. The individual results are then accumulated in the `results` array, which is then returned. This maintains the order of input strings in the output.\n\nBefore running, make sure that Julia is started with multiple threads (Default might be 1). You can set environment variable before starting julia e.g., in Unix `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4` or run Julia with the `-t` option like `julia -t 4`.","status":200,"tokens":[97,403],"elapsed":15.184037875,"cost":0.01306,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1164843857,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
