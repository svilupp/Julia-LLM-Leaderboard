If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"ay\" to the end.\n     2. If a word starts with a consonant, move all the letters before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n   - Implement the transformation function `to_pig_latin`.\n   - Use Julia's multi-threading capabilities to handle each word in a separate thread.\n   - Collect the results from each thread.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n   - Create `to_pig_latin` function to transform a single word.\n   - Create `pig_latinify` function to handle a vector of strings.\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n   - Define and test `to_pig_latin`.\n   - Define and implement `pig_latinify` using multi-threading.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n   - Create test cases.\n\n### Step by Step Implementation\n\n#### Step 1: Define the `to_pig_latin` Function\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"  # All consonants: treat whole word as the beginning\n        end\n        return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Implement `pig_latinify` with Multi-Threading\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    transformed = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        transformed[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return transformed\nend\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Test and Verify\n\n```julia\n# Create some sample data\nsample_words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\n\n# Apply the pig latin transformation\nresult = pig_latinify(sample_words)\n\n# Output the result\nprintln(result)  # Expected: [\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\n## Example Execution\n\nGiven the function implementation and step-by-step testing, one would follow the test case:\n`sample_words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]` leading to the expected transform:\n`[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`. With this operation done using multi-threading, each word is processed in a separate thread potentially speeding up the execution for large datasets.","status":200,"tokens":[170,637],"elapsed":24.523458917,"cost":0.020810000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":765071964,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
