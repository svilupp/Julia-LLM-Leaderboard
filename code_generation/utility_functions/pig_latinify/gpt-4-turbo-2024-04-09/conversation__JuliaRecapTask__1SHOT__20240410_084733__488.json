[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Transforming strings using simple rules of Pig Latin.\n2. Utilizing multithreading for parallel processing.\n\n### Pig Latin Basic Rules\n- For words that begin with vowels, add \"way\" to the end.\n- For words that begin with consonants, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n\n### Multithreading in Julia\n- Use `Threads.@threads` for a multithreaded `for` loop.\n- Initialize threading with `Threads.nthreads()` to check or set up the number of threads.\n\n# Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # The number of words\n    n = length(words)\n    # Resulting vector with the same size\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        pig_latin_words[i] = convert_to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    # Find index of the first vowel\n    idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, lowercase(word))\n\n    if idx === nothing\n        # no vowels found, treat as all consonants word\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif idx == 1\n        # starts with a vowel\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # remove the consonants before the first vowel and add them to the end with \"ay\"\n        return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n# Verification Step\nEnsure the function behaves as expected:\n- Check for simple cases like \"hello\" -> \"ellohay\", \"apple\" -> \"appleway\", \"strong\" -> \"ongstray\".\n- Ensure threading does not affect the correctness through race conditions by maintaining isolated transformations for each word.\n\nSince Julia uses 1-based indexing and handles string manipulation robustly, the above implementation is designed specifically to be correct and efficient, leveraging in-built threading mechanisms of Julia. Make sure array indexing and substring edge cases are well-handled.","status":200,"tokens":[320,508],"elapsed":15.89131975,"cost":0.01844,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":544720131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
