[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a function `to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) -> AbstractString` that:\n   - Identifies the first vowel in the word.\n   - Transforms the word into pig latin based on the position of the first vowel.\n2. Define the main function `pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString}) -> Vector{AbstractString}` that:\n   - Uses multiple threads to convert each word in the input vector to pig latin using `Threads.@spawn` and collects the results.\n\n### Step 3: Double-check the solution\n- Ensure that `to_pig_latinate` handles edge cases like empty strings, strings without vowels, and diverse case sensitivity.\n- Check that `pig_latinify` correctly utilizes multiple threads and produces the expected outcomes.\n\nHere is how this can be actualized in Julia code:\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    if isempty(word)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Define vowels\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n\n    if isnothing(idx)\n        # No vowels found, return as is with \"ay\"\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Perform pig latin transformation\n        prefix = word[1:idx-1]\n        stem = word[idx:end]\n        return stem * prefix * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString}) :: Vector{AbstractString}\n    transformed = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    # Dispatch each transformation to a separate thread\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn begin\n        transformed[i] = to_pig_latin(word)\n    end for (i, word) in enumerate(words)]\n\n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    foreach(Threads.wait, tasks)\n\n    return transformed\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"string\", \"World\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis design utilizes multiple threads to handle different inputs concurrently, which could improve performance for input vectors with large numbers of elements, especially in an environment with multiple cores.","status":200,"tokens":[320,619],"elapsed":24.660487459,"cost":0.02177,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1096168640,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
