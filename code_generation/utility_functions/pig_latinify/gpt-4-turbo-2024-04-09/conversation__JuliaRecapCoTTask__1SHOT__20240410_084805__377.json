[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define `pig_latinify_word` for single words.\n2. Define `pig_latinify` that employs multithreading to process multiple words.\n\n### Implement `pig_latinify_word`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for i in eachindex(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word  # Catch for all-consonant words\nend\n```\n\n### Implement `pig_latinify` with multithreading:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nBe aware of thread safety; in this specific case of independent processing based on index, the threads should operate safely without data race conditions.\n\n## Double-check Solution:\n1. **Pig Latin Rules**: Check vowels and consonant transformation rules are accurately formulated in `pig_latinify_word`.\n2. **Multithreading**: Verify multithreading is correctly setup and data races are avoided.\n3. **Execution**: Each thread processes one element from the array concurrently, improving the efficiency.\n\nThis implementation is both thread-safe and adheres to the details of the Pig Latin transformation rules. The function processes each word in the provided array independently, making good use of concurrency for performance gains on appropriately equipped systems. Always ensure that the environment is set up for the expected number of threads by setting `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` appropriately before running the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[321,542],"elapsed":15.600996834,"cost":0.01947,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":116649377,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
