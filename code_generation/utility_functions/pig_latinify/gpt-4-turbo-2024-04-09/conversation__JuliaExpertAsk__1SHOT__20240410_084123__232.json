Each string is processed on a separate thread using Julia's multithreading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn, @sync\n\n\"\"\"\nTransform a single word to Pig Latin.\n\"\"\"\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, lowercase(word))\n\n    if first_vowel_idx === nothing || first_vowel_idx == 1\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[first_vowel_idx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n\"\"\"\nTransform a vector of strings to Pig Latin,\nprocessing each string in a separate thread.\n\"\"\"\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @sync for i in eachindex(words)\n        @spawn transformed[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return transformed\nend\n```\n\n### Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\", \"language\"]\npig_latin = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `to_pig_latin` function takes a single word and converts it to Pig Latin following basic rules (move initial consonants to the end and add \"ay\").\n- The `pig_latinify` function accepts a vector of strings. It initializes a vector `transformed` of the same size as `words`. For each word, it spawns a new thread (`@spawn`) that processes the word using `to_pig_latin` function. The `@sync` macro ensures that the function waits for all spawned tasks to complete before returning the `transformed` vector. This vector contains the Pig Latin transformations of the provided words.","status":200,"tokens":[97,437],"elapsed":10.597177958,"cost":0.01408,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1421538845,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
