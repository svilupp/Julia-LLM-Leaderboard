It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this in Julia using the `Threads.@threads` macro for parallel processing. Hereâ€™s how you can define the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        \n        vowel_start = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        first_char = word[1]\n        \n        if first_char in vowel_start\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\n### Usage Example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will convert the words to Pig Latin and run the transformations in parallel using threads. Make sure to run this in an environment that supports multithreading and has enough threads allocated.","status":200,"tokens":[95,260],"elapsed":5.48688375,"cost":0.00017025,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":120355848,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
