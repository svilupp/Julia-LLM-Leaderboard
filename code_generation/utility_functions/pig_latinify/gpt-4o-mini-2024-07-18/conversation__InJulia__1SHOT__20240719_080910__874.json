Here's a sample implementation of the Pig Latin transformation along with the threading logic:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        # Find the index of the first vowel in the word\n        for (i, letter) in enumerate(word)\n            if letter in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        # If no vowel found, just return original word + \"ay\"\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    # Using Threads.@threads to parallelize the transformation\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example Usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **pig_latin_word(word::String)**: This function takes a single word, converts it to lowercase, checks whether it starts with a vowel, and constructs the Pig Latin version according to the rules:\n   - For words starting with a vowel, it adds \"yay\".\n   - For words starting with a consonant, it moves the leading consonants to the end followed by \"ay\". If there are no vowels found, it simply appends \"ay\".\n\n2. **pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})**: This function creates a result vector of the same length as the input vector, iterates through each word using `Threads.@threads` to process them in parallel, and stores the transformed words in the result vector.\n\n3. **Example Usage**: The function demonstrates the usage of `pig_latinify` by converting a vector of strings and printing the results.\n\nTo run this code, make sure you have an appropriate multi-threaded environment in Julia, as enabling multiple threads depends on your Julia installation configuration (using `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable).","status":200,"tokens":[62,541],"elapsed":7.117488125,"cost":0.0003339,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1946049784,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
