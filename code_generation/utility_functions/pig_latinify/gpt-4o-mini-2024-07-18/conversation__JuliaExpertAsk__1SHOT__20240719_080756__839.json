Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Threads` module in Julia to achieve this. Here's how you can implement the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        first_char = word[1]\n        if first_char in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"yay\"  # for words starting with a vowel\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"  # for words starting with a consonant\n        end\n    end\n    \n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"world\", \"ear\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `pig_latinify` function, which transforms each string in a vector to its Pig Latin form using multithreading. The helper function `to_pig_latin` handles the conversion logic.","status":200,"tokens":[95,267],"elapsed":3.17787975,"cost":0.00017444999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-69081264,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
