Define the `pig_latinify` function that accepts a vector of strings.\n2. Implement the Pig Latin conversion rules:\n   - For words starting with a consonant, move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\" (e.g., \"hello\" -> \"ellohay\").\n   - For words starting with a vowel, simply add \"way\" at the end (e.g., \"apple\" -> \"appleway\").\n3. Use Julia's `Threads.@threads` to process each string in parallel.\n\nNow, let's implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin_word(word::String)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        first_char = word[1]\n        if first_char in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the position to split the word\n            for i in 1:length(word)\n                if word[i] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                    return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n                end\n            end\n            return word * \"ay\"  # If no vowels are found, just add \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create a vector to hold results\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Use multithreading to convert each word\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `pig_latin_word` function handles the conversion for a single word according to the Pig Latin rules.\n- The outer function `pig_latinify` initializes a results vector and uses threading to apply the conversion to each string in the input vector concurrently.\n\n### Verification:\nI will now run this code to confirm that it works correctly. \n\nThe expected output for `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])` should be:\n- \"ellohay\" for \"hello\".\n- \"appleway\" for \"apple\".\n- \"ongstray\" for \"strong\".\n- \"orldway\" for \"world\".\n\nAfter running the above code, you can verify that the output matches these transformations.","status":200,"tokens":[170,575],"elapsed":6.269798667,"cost":0.0003705,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1654452665,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
