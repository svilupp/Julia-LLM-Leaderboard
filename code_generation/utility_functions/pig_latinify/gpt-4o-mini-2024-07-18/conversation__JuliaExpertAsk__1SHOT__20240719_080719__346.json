Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create a `pig_latinify` function in Julia that utilizes threading to transform each string in a vector to Pig Latin. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)\n        if length(word) == 0\n            return word\n        end\n\n        first_char = word[1]\n        if first_char in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\n### Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\npig_latin_result = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_result)\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a separate thread for each string to perform the transformation concurrently. Each word is transformed according to the rules of Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[95,236],"elapsed":2.363436667,"cost":0.00015585,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1921469860,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
