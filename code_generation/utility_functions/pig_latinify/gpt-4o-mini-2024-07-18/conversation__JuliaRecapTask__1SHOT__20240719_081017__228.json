X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If a word begins with a consonant or a cluster of consonants, move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n2. If a word begins with a vowel, simply add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n\nWe will create a function `pig_latinify` that accepts a vector of strings and transforms each string into Pig Latin using multiple threads. For each string, we'll run the transformation asynchronously.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. Define the `pig_latin` function that handles the transformation for a single string.\n2. Use `Threads.@threads` to apply this transformation across multiple threads.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if !isempty(word) # check if the word is not empty\n        first_character = word[1]\n        \n        # Check if the first letter is a vowel\n        if first_character in vowels\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the first vowel in the word\n            idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n            if idx === nothing\n                return word * \"ay\"  # If no vowels were found, just append \"ay\"\n            else\n                # Move the consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\"\n                return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return word  # return as is if the word is empty\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example Usage:\n# original_words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"string\", \"igloo\"]\n# pig_latin_words = pig_latinify(original_words)\n# println(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n### Key Notes:\n- We used the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the execution of the transformation across the vector of words.\n- Each word is processed independently in a separate thread to ensure efficient use of resources.\n- The function safely handles vowel and consonant transformations, including cases with no vowels.\n\n### Double-checking the solution:\n1. The transformation rules are implemented correctly.\n2. The usage of threading is appropriate for performance.\n3. The code will handle empty strings and the absence of vowels correctly.\n\nWith this implementation, you can now call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings, and it will return their Pig Latin equivalents efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[318,591],"elapsed":5.762913917,"cost":0.0004023,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":122576581,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
