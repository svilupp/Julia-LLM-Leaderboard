Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can implement the `pig_latinify` function in Julia using multithreading with the `Threads.@spawn` macro. Here's a concise implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Move the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end and add \"ay\"\n        index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word) or length(word) + 1\n        return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **pig_latin**: This helper function converts a single word to Pig Latin.\n- **pig_latinify**: This function takes a vector of strings, spawns threads for each word conversion, and fetches the results.\n\nMake sure to enable multithreading when you run your Julia program by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.","status":200,"tokens":[95,260],"elapsed":4.419997167,"cost":0.00017025,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":241452540,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
