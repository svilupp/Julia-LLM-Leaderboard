Define the rules for transforming a word into Pig Latin.\n2. Use the `Threads.@spawn` macro for concurrent processing of each string.\n3. Collect the results once all threads have completed.\n\n### Step 1: Pig Latin Transformation Logic\nThe rules for Pig Latin:\n- For words that begin with a consonant or a consonant cluster, move the consonant(s) to the end and add \"ay\".\n- For words that begin with a vowel, just add \"yay\" at the end.\n\n### Step 2: Implementing the `pig_latinify` function\nI'll define the function and implement the threading.\n\n### Code Implementation\n```julia\nusing LinearAlgebra\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latin_transform(word::String)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        lowercase_word = lowercase(word)\n        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        \n        if lowercase_word[1] in vowels\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            idx = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, lowercase_word) || length(word) + 1\n            consonant_cluster = lowercase_word[1:idx-1]\n            rest_of_word = lowercase_word[idx:end]\n            return rest_of_word * consonant_cluster * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create an array for the futures\n    futures = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        push!(futures, Threads.@spawn pig_latin_transform(word))\n    end\n\n    # Collect the results\n    return [fetch(f) for f in futures]\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Testing the Solution\nLet's execute the function `pig_latinify` on the provided data and print the results.\n\n### Check for correctness\nWhen executed, the expected results for the words would be:\n- \"hello\" -> \"ellohay\"\n- \"apple\" -> \"appleyay\"\n- \"strong\" -> \"ongstray\"\n- \"world\" -> \"orldway\"\n\nThe function should correctly return an array of these transformed words. \n\nNow we can run the code to verify.","status":200,"tokens":[170,511],"elapsed":5.025894041,"cost":0.0003321,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":872546552,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
