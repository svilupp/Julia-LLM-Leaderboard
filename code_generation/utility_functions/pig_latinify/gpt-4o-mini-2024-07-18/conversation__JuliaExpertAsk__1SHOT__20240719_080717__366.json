Here's a concise implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    consonant_cluster = r\"^([^aeiou]*)(.*)\"\n    if occursin(consonant_cluster, word)\n        m = match(consonant_cluster, word)\n        return m.captures[2] * m.captures[1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"string\", \"orange\"]\ntranslated = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(translated)\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a helper function `pig_latin` that converts a single word into Pig Latin and then uses multi-threading to process a vector of words in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[95,251],"elapsed":2.6830175,"cost":0.00016485,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1086207272,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
