Hereâ€™s a concise implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        if startswith(word, vowels)\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n            if first_vowel_index === nothing\n                return word * \"ay\"  # No vowels found\n            else\n                return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return Threads.@threads for word in words\n        to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# println(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"just\", \"ask\"]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function `to_pig_latin`**: Converts a single word to Pig Latin according to standard rules.\n2. **Multithreading**: Utilizes `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation for each word in the input vector.\n3. **Result**: Returns a new vector with the transformed strings in Pig Latin. \n\nMake sure to run this code in an environment that supports multi-threading in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[95,309],"elapsed":5.304195291,"cost":0.00019964999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1756283011,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
