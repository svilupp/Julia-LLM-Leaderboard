[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'll also make sure that each transformation runs on a separate thread.\n\n## Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\n1. **Threading**: To run tasks in separate threads`, I can use `Threads.@threads` for parallel execution.\n2. **Pig Latin Conversion Logic**:\n   - If a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end and add \"ay\" (e.g., \"hello\" → \"ellohay\").\n   - If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"yay\" to the end (e.g., \"apple\" → \"appleyay\").\n3. **Function Definitions**: Using `function` to define the Pig Latin transformation.\n\n## Implementation:\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function will use Julia's multi-threading capabilities to process each string concurrently. Below is the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = Set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word  # Return empty string as is\n    end\n    \n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"  # Words starting with a vowel\n    else\n        # Find the index where the first vowel occurs\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        return word * \"ay\"  # In case no vowels are found\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings to Pig Latin using threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\n## Testing the Function:\n\nI will test the `pig_latinify` function with various input cases to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```julia\n# Example test cases\ntest_words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"string\", \"a\", \"sky\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(test_words)\n\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ananabay\", \"ingstray\", \"ayay\", \"yskay\"]\n```\n\n## Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The function handles words beginning with vowels and consonants correctly.\n- The threading implementation `Threads.@threads` ensures that transformations are done in separate threads.\n- The function accommodates both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.\n- The output is stored in an array of the same length as the input.\n\nThe implementation appears correct upon review.","status":200,"tokens":[318,614],"elapsed":6.812854584,"cost":0.00041610000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":708720183,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
