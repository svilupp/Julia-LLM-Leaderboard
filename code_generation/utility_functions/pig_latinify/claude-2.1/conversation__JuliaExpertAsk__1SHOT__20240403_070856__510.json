The results are stored in the pre-allocated `results` vector to avoid race conditions. The `@sync` macro waits for all threads to finish before returning the final vector.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[97,298],"elapsed":10.91001125,"cost":0.007928000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1099,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
