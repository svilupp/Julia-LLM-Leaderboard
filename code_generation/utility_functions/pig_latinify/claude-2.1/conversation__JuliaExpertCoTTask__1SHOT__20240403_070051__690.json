The threads are stored and joined at the end to wait for them to finish.\n\nA helper `pig_latinify` function does the actual transformation on a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case it appends \"yay\". Otherwise, it extracts the starting consonants, moves them to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nSome examples are provided at the end to test it out. The key elements are:\n\n- Multithreading with `@spawn` and `foreach(join, threads)` \n- Regular expressions to extract consonant prefixes\n- String manipulation to rearrange the words\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[178,398],"elapsed":15.747691875,"cost":0.010976,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-197,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
