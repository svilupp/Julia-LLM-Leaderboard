Create a Channel to store the results\n2. Launch a task for each word using `@async` and `@sync`\n3. The task calls `thread_pig_latinify` on each word \n4. `thread_pig_latinify` converts the word to pig latin\n5. Results are put into the Channel\n6. Finally, results are collected from the Channel\n\nThis parallelizes the pig latin conversion across multiple threads.
