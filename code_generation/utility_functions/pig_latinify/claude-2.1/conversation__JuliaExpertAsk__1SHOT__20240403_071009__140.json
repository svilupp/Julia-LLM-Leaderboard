The results are stored in a preallocated results vector that gets joined at the end.\n\nSome key points:\n\n- Use `Threads.@threads` for easy parallelism \n- Check for common word patterns like starting with qu/vowel\n- Use `findfirst` and `occursin` to find the first vowel\n- Slice and concatenate the strings to transform words\n- Preallocate results vector for better performance\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[97,347],"elapsed":15.7918855,"cost":0.009104000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
