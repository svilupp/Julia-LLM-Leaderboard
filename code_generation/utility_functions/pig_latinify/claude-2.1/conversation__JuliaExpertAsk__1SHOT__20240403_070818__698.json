It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a multi-threaded implementation of a pig latinify function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = String[]\n    threads = Thread[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn begin\n            if first(word) in [\"a\",\"e\",\"i\",\"o\",\"u\"]\n                push!(results, word * \"yay\")\n            else\n                vowel_idx = findfirst(isequal(\"a\"), word) \n                consonants = first(word, vowel_idx-1)\n                remainder = word[vowel_idx:end]\n                push!(results, remainder * consonants * \"ay\")\n            end\n        end)\n    end\n    \n    foreach(join, threads)\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe key aspects:\n\n- Use a threads array to store each thread \n- Use `Threads.@spawn` to launch a new thread for each word\n- Process the word to pig latin within the thread\n- Store the result and join all threads before returning\n\nThis allows easy parallelization across multiple words while ensuring thread safety.
