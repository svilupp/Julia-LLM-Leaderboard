It launches a separate thread for each word to convert it to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_word` helper function. The threads are collected and waited on before returning the final results.\n\nSome key points:\n\n- Use a thread for each word with `@spawn`\n- Accumulate the results in a results array\n- `fetch` each thread to wait for it to complete \n- Helper function to handle the pig latin translation rules\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[178,345],"elapsed":12.177055,"cost":0.009704,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21839,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
