[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `latinify` helper does the actual transformation sequentially.\n\nSome key aspects:\n\n- Uses `Threads.@threads` macro to automatically parallelize the for loop\n- Creates a results array to store the outputs\n- `latinify` does the actual transformation\n- Uses a regex for detecting vowels to avoid duplicate code\n\nLet me know if you have any other requirements for the implementation! I focused on making it multi-threaded and high performance as per the instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[332,324],"elapsed":19.987011916,"cost":0.010432,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3090,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
