It initializes an empty results vector and threads vector. \n\nFor each word, it spawns a new thread that transforms the word to pig latin by checking if the first letter is a vowel. If so, it appends \"yay\", otherwise it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\". \n\nThe transformed pig latin word is pushed to the results vector. The thread is also saved to the threads vector.\n\nAfter all words are processed, the threads are joined using `foreach(Threads.@spawnjoin, threads)`. Finally, the results vector containing the pig latin words is returned.\n\nTo test it, some sample words are defined and passed to `pig_latinify`, printing out the translated vector of words.\n\nThe key elements are:\n\n- Process each word in a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`\n- Join all threads at the end before returning results\n- Share a results vector between threads to collect the outputs\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[178,457],"elapsed":16.021766542,"cost":0.012392,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8592,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
