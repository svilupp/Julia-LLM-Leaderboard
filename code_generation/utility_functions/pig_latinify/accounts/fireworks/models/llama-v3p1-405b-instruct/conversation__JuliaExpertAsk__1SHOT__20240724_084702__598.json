Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of a pig latin transformer in Julia. We utilize `Threads` for concurrent processing:\n\n```julia\n# Pig Latin transformation rules\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    const vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Thread-safe pig latin transformation function\nfunction threaded_pig_latinify(words_list)\n    mapped_list = Vector{String}(undef, length(words_list))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words_list)\n        mapped_list[i] = pig_latinify_word(words_list[i])\n    end\n\n    return mapped_list\nend\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"python\"]\n\n@time threaded_pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\n**Note**: To use the multithreading functionality, Julia needs to be started with at least as many threads as cores you want to utilize. Example: for a quad-core CPU the following command can be used:\n\n```bash\njulia -t 4 --project=/path/to/your/project/\n```\n\nEnter this into the terminal, replacing `/path/to/your/project/` with the actual path.","status":200,"tokens":[100,269],"elapsed":9.16925975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":16292332,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
