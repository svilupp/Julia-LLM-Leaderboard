The primary function, `threaded_pig_latinify`, applies this conversion to the\nelements of an array using multi-threading.\n\nNote that multi-threading may not speed up operations for small input sizes,\ndepending on the number of cores available. It will likely work best on larger inputs\nwith an efficiently multithreaded BLAS implementation or for platforms\nwith at least as many cores as the length of the data input.\n\nAlways check for efficiency trade-offs of programming techniques,\nnot all runtimes support Julia's multithreading capabilities well. In order\nto enable multi-threading, attempt either: \n1. make sure julia is launched on a platform that can be started with multithreading, so the best usecase is of multi-threaded code will run on a single\n    CPU (only as many threads as the cores available) without specialized hardware.\n2. follow an official approach set in the performance tips.","status":200,"tokens":[100,464],"elapsed":21.456170875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1836974827,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
