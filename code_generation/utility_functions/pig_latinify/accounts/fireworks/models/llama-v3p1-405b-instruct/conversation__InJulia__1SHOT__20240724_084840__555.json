For example:\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\n\nThis will use 4 threads to transform the input vector of strings to Pig Latin. You can adjust the number of threads based on your system's available resources and the size of your input data.","status":200,"tokens":[65,535],"elapsed":21.203148292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1025289880,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
