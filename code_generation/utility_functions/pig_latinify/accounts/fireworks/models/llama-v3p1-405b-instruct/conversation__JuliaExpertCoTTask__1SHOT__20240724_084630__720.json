Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's write a pig latin transformer in Julia.\n\n## Step 1: Define the function to convert English to Pig Latin\nThe rules for Pig Latin are as follows: If the word begins with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), we just add \"way\" to the end. If the word begins with a consonant, we move all the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\n## Step 2: Write a helper function to check if a character is a vowel\nWe'll use this to check each character in the string.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the `pig_latinify` function\nThis will iterate over each word in the input list and apply the transformation.\n\n## Step 4: Add multithreading\nTo make this run in parallel, we'll use Julia's existing multithreading support.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```julia\n# Helper function to check if a character is a vowel\nfunction isvowel(char)\n    return char in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\nend\n\n# Convert English to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    if isvowel(word[1])\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        vowel_index = findfirst(isvowel, word)\n        if vowel_index == nothing # No vowels in the word\n            return string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            return string(word[vowel_index:end], word[1:vowel_index-1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a list of strings to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = lowercase(words[i])  # To simplify the rules\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\n# Data\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\nPlease note that you may need to enable multithreading to run this code by adding JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 in your environment before starting Julia.
