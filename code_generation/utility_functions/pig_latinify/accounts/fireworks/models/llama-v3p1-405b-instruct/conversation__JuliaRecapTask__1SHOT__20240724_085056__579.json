[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a pig latin transformation function called `pig_latinify`.\n2. Define an inner function called `transform_word` that changes a word into Pig Latin.\n3. Apply `transform_word` to each string in the input vector while running each iteration on a separate thread.\n\nHere is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\ntransform_word(word::AbstractString) = begin\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif startswith(lowercase(word), 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for index in 1:length(word)\n            if lowercase(word[index]) in 'a':'e','i':'o','u'\n                return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    t = Threads.nthreads()\n    splits = splitrange(length(words), t)\n    transformed_words = Array{Union{Nothing,Any}}(nothing, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for tid in 1:t\n        start_index, end_index = splits[tid]\n        word_index = offset = start_index\n\n        for word in view(words, start_index:end_index)\n            transformed_words[word_index] = transform_word(word)\n            word_index += offset\n            offset = 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\nThe `transform_word` function will correctly transform a single English word into it's Pig Latin version.","status":200,"tokens":[322,339],"elapsed":11.93178025,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":256759814,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
