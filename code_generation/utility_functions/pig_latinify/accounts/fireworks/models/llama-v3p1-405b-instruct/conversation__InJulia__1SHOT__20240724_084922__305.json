It uses a helper function `transform_word` to transform each word to Pig Latin. The transformation rules are defined using a set of vowels and a suffix \"ay\".\n\nThe `transform_word` function checks if the word is empty, starts with a vowel, or contains a vowel. It then applies the corresponding transformation rule to convert the word to Pig Latin.\n\nTo improve performance, the code uses Julia's multi-threading capabilities to transform each word in parallel. The `@sync` macro is used to synchronize the threads, and the `@spawn` macro is used to launch a new thread for each word.\n\nThe results are stored in a pre-allocated vector `results`, which is then returned by the function.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* Transforming a vector of words to Pig Latin: `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\"])`\n* Using the `pig_latinify` function in a larger program: `words = [...] pig_latinified = pig_latinify(words) println(pig_latinified)`","status":200,"tokens":[65,579],"elapsed":22.103641667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1220506958,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
