The `@threads` macro is used to create and manage the threads for the loop. Each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread, improving performance for large input arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[173,260],"elapsed":11.187990292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-689952270,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
