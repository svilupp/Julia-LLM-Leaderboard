[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses a `Mutex` (short for \"mutual exclusion\") to ensure that the `push!` operation on the output vector is thread-safe.\n\nIt also defines an inner function `convert_to_pig_latin` that performs the actual conversion. This function checks if the string starts with a vowel and, if so, returns the string with \"way\" appended. Otherwise, it returns the string with the first character moved to the end and \"ay\" appended.","status":200,"tokens":[322,407],"elapsed":1.486812584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2132260493,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
