The function checks the original string in a series of `if/elseif` conditions depending on its starting letter. The function uses a combination of conditions and checks to determine how to form the Pig Latin string from the input string, which is based on standard Pig Latin rules:\n\n* If the word begins with a vowel, it is left unchanged.\n* If the word begins with 'th', 'ch', 'qu', 'sh', then 'th' and 'ch' are left unchanged unless they appear after 'sh' or 'wh'. \n* If the word begins with 'wh', then 'wh' is changed to 'h'. \n* Otherwise, move the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end of the word and add 'ay'.","status":200,"tokens":[173,452],"elapsed":1.895039875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2139644145,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
