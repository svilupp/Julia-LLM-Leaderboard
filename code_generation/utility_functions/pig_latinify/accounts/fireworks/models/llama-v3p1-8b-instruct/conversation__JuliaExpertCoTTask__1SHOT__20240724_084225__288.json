A function `pig_latinify` is defined which takes a list of words as input. It uses a helper function `word_latinify` to transform each word into its Pig Latin equivalent.\n2.  The `word_latinify` function finds the first vowel in a word and moves all letters before it to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n3.  The `Threads.@threads for` macro allows each word to be processed in separate threads.\n4.  The `push!(result,lainenied_word)` line adds the transformed word back to the result list.","status":200,"tokens":[173,337],"elapsed":1.309813708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-373289281,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
