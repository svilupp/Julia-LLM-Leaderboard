If it's not, we throw an error.\n*   We then split the main vector of strings into chunks, where each chunk is transformed by a separate worker process.\n*   The `pig_latinify_thread` function applies the Pig Latin transformation to a single string by moving the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end of the word and adding \"ay\" to the end.\n*   We use the `@everywhere include(\"pig_latinify.jl\")` directive to share the code across processes. This is necessary because the `pig_latinify_thread` function uses a global variable `pid2pids`.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\", \"strings\", \"transform\", \"to\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\nparsed = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(parsed)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"amplexeay\", \"trngsasley\", \"ormtfay\", \"otgay\", \"igpay\", \"atinlay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[65,649],"elapsed":2.215367166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-268052657,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
