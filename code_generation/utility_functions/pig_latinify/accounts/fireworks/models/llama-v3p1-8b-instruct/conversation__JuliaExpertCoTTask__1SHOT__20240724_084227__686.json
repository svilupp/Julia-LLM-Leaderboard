It converts the words by selecting the first character, moving it to the end, followed by 'ay' as per the task's specifications. This program uses parallel Threads for each string to the input array which increases performance.\nThe code handles each case of vowel string in \"aeiou\" by pushing the character to the end and handling the common strings.","status":200,"tokens":[173,260],"elapsed":1.052175041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1131249833,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
