[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This allows Julia to determine which method of `pig_latinify()` to call based on the type of input argument.\n*   We declared the `@everywhere using Lazy` and `@everywhere function lazify(lst)` necessary to broadcast definitions to the worker process and the `@everywhere function pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)` necessary to broadcast the `pig_latinify` function to the worker process.\n*   This is our implementation of a Pig Latin transformer using Julia's `Threads` and `Distributed` packages. Julia is able to run each iteration on a separate thread, utilizing the processing power and memory of all available CPU cores to improve performance on large inputs, such as vectors of long words.","status":200,"tokens":[322,667],"elapsed":2.318359708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-665777196,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
