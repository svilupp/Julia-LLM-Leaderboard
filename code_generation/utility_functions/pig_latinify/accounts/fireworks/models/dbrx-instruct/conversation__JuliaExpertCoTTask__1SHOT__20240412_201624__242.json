To create a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings, I will first define the function `pig_latinify` which takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. For each string in the vector, I will create a new thread that applies the pig latin transformation. To do this, I will use the `Threads.@spawn` macro.\n3. The pig latin transformation consists of moving the first letter of the word to the end and appending \"ay\" to it. For example, \"hello\" becomes \"ellohay\".\n4. After creating the threads, I will use the `fetch` function to retrieve the results from each thread and store them in a new vector.\n5. Finally, I will return the new vector of pig latin strings.\n\nHere is the code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words","status":200,"tokens":[172,200],"elapsed":3.996904875,"cost":0.0005951999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":962650190,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
