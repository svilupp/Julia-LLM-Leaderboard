Each iteration is run on a separate thread using the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n\nBefore executing the function, make sure to import the Threads module with `using Base.Threads`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,179],"elapsed":3.167072,"cost":0.00044479999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":903837774,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
