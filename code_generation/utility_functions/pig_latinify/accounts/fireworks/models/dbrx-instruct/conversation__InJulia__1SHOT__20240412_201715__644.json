It uses the `@distributed` macro to run each iteration on a separate thread, allowing for parallel processing. The `pig_latinify!` function also uses the `split` and `string` functions to add \"way\" to the","status":200,"tokens":[64,200],"elapsed":5.745874792,"cost":0.00042239999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-633168184,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
