In this case, we need to create a Julia function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and modifies each string in parallel to its pig latin equivalent.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the `Threads.@threads` macro for parallel processing and `map()` for applying the transformation on each string. Here's the code for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latin(word::String)\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if first_letter in vowels\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            rest_letters = word[2:end]\n            return rest_letters * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return map(word -> Threads","status":200,"tokens":[64,200],"elapsed":3.416768583,"cost":0.00042239999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1293576754,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
