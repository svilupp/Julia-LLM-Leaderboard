Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

First, I will recall a Julia snippet for creating a function that transforms a string into pig latin. I will use the standard library functions for string manipulation.\n2. Next, I will create a parallel version of the function that maps the `pig_latinify` function to each element of a vector of strings using the `Threads.@threads` macro for multi-threading.\n3.
