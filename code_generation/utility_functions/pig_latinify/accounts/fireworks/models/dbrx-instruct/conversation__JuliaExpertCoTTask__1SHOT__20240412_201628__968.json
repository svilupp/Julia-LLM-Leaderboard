To solve this task, I will first define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. I will then create a separate thread for each string in the vector and apply the pig latin transformation to it.\n3. Here's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        pig_latin_word = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\n4.
