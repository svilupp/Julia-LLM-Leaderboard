Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that pig latinifies a vector of strings using multi-threading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        words[i] = isempty(word) ||!isletter(first(word))? word : \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachindex` function to iterate over the indices of the input vector, and the `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop. The pig latin conversion is done by taking all letters except the first one, appending the first letter followed by \"ay\". If the word is empty or doesn't start with a letter, it remains unchanged.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"123\", \"Jul","status":200,"tokens":[99,200],"elapsed":5.701509708,"cost":0.0004784,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-1282315295,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
