[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

First, I'll write a function to convert a single string to pig latin. This function will take a string as input and return the pig latin version of that string.\n2. Next, I'll use the `Threads.@threads` macro from the `Threads` standard library to parallelize the iteration over the vector of strings. This will allow each string to be converted to pig latin on a separate thread.\n3. Finally, I'll double-check that the solution is correct by testing it with a few example inputs.\n\n```julia\n# pig_latinify function\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    # Check if the first character of the word is a vowel\n    if word[1] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # If the first character is a consonant, find the first vowel and split the word there\n        for i in 2","status":200,"tokens":[321,200],"elapsed":3.559479791,"cost":0.0008336,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":894583249,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
