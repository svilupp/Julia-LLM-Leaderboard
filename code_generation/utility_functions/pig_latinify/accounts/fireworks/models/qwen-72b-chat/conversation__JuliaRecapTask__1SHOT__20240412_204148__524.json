Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n2. Solve the Task\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets:\n\n* Threads: Julia has native support for multithreading. To use threads, we can start by creating a `ThreadPool` and then submitting tasks to it using `@threads`. Note that for a vector of strings, we need to use `Threads.@spawn` to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n* Pig Latin Rules:\n\t1. If a word starts with a vowel, simply append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n\t2. If a word starts with a consonant cluster, move the consonants to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n\t3. Ignore punctuation and whitespace.\n\nNow, let's solve the task by implementing `pig_latinify` function.\n\n```julia\nusing","status":200,"tokens":[322,200],"elapsed":3.831976542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-174862997,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
