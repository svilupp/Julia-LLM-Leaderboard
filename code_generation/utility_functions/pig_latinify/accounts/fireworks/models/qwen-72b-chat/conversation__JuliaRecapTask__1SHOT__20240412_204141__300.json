[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a helper function `pig_latin` that takes a string as input and returns its pig Latin form.\n  2. Define a `ThreadPool` and use it to create a separate thread for each iteration of the input vector.\n  3. Use the `@spawn` macro to schedule a call to the `pig_latin` function on each thread.\n  4. Collect the results from the threads using the `fetch` function and store them in an output vector.\n  5. Return the output vector with the pig Latin translations.\n\n### Code\nI've designed the following code snippet to meet the requirements of this task.\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latin(input)\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms input string to pig Latin.\n    \"\"\"\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    # Remove empty strings\n    if input == \"\"\n        return \"\"\n    end","status":200,"tokens":[322,200],"elapsed":3.827740875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1204102065,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
