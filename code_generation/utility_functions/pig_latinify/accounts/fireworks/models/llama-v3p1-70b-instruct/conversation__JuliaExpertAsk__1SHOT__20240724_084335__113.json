Also, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true parallel execution of threads is not possible in Julia (yet?). This example should still work, but the threads may not run in parallel.\n\nNote: Pig-Latinify is a simple example and does not cover all cases of the Pig Latin rules (e.g., it does not treat punctuation correctly).","status":200,"tokens":[100,458],"elapsed":4.501353875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1032999274,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
