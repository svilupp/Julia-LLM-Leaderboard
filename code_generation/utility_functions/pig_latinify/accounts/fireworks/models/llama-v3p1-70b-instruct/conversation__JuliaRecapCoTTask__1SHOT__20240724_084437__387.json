[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function uses multi-threading to parallelize the transformation of each string.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    # Helper function to transform a single word into Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin_word(word)\n        # If word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n        if lowercase(word[1]) in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the index of the first vowel\n            idx = findnext(lowercase(word) .âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], 1)\n            if idx === nothing\n                # If no vowel is found, return the word as it is\n                return word\n            end\n            # Move all characters before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\"\n            return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Use multi-threading to transform each word\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n1.  The code defines a helper function `pig_latin_word` that takes a word as input and returns its Pig Latin equivalent.\n2.  The `pig_latinify` function iterates over the input vector of words and applies the `pig_latin_word` function to each word in parallel using the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n3.  The code uses the `findnext` function to determine the index of the first vowel in a word. If a word does not contain any vowels, it is left unchanged.\n4.  The `pig_latinify` function returns the modified vector of words in Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[323,448],"elapsed":8.061253625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2147227521,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
