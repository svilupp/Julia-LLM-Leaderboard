If you have multiple CPU cores, you can run the following command to enable multithreading:\n```julia\nusing LinearAlgebra\nBLAS.set_num_threads(4)  # number of threads matches the number of cores\n```\n\nHowever, for simple tasks like this one, using multiple threads may not provide a significant speedup, and might even be slower than running the task in a single thread, due to the overhead of creating and switching between threads.","status":200,"tokens":[173,408],"elapsed":3.421582,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":869264387,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
