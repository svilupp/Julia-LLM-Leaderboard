[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then uses a vectorized version of the function to apply the same transformation to a list of strings in parallel. \n\nPlease note that the `Threads.nthreads()` call at the beginning of the code ensures that the number of threads is set to a value greater than 1 for parallel processing. \n\nIn the `pig_latinify` function, the first letter of the word is checked to determine whether it is a vowel or consonant. Based on the check, the word is modified accordingly to Pig Latin and returned. \n\nIn the vectorized version of the `pig_latinify` function, the transformation of each string is handled by a separate thread using the `Threads.@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[322,543],"elapsed":4.85885575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1315451190,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
