[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function takes a vector of strings and transforms each string to Pig Latin. The transformation rules for Pig Latin are as follows: \n\n* if the word begins with a vowel, 'way' is appended to the end of the word\n* if the word begins with a consonant, the consonant is moved to the end of the word and 'ay' is appended.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = similar(words)\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            result[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            consonant_cluster = findfirst(c->c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], word)\n            consonant_cluster = isnothing(consonant_cluster) ? length(word) : consonant_cluster\n            result[i] = word[consonant_cluster+1:end] * word[1:consonant_cluster] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words)) \n```\n\nThis function works on a vector of strings and transforms each word to Pig Latin in parallel. It handles the cases where the word begins with a vowel or a consonant separately, and it also considers the case where the word contains a consonant cluster. \n\nPlease note that due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), threading in Julia may not always lead to true parallel execution. However, for I/O-bound tasks, this can still be beneficial. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using Julia's `pmap` function and its built-in support for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[322,398],"elapsed":3.806043667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1024413927,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
