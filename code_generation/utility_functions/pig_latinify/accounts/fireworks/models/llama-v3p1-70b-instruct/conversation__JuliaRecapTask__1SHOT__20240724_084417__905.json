[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for the `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if first_letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            pig_latin_word = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            pig_latin_word = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_to_transform = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cat\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words_to_transform)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input. It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each string in the input vector, performing the Pig Latin transformation on each string in a separate thread. The transformed strings are stored in a new vector `pig_latin_words`, which is returned by the function.\n\nThe Pig Latin transformation rules are as follows:\n\n* If the first letter of the word is a vowel, the word is appended with \"way\".\n* Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of words and print the resulting Pig Latin words.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input vector of strings only contains words with ASCII letters. If the input vector may contain words with non-ASCII letters, additional modifications may be necessary to handle these cases correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[322,390],"elapsed":3.310734375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":730559307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
