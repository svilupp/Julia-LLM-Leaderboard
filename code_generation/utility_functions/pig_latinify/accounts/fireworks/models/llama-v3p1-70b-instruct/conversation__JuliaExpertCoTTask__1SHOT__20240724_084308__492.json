The `pig_latinify` function transforms a single string into pig latin. The `pig_latinify_threaded` function splits a vector of strings across multiple threads and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each one.\n\nPlease note that in order to run this code, you should have at least Julia 1.3. In earlier versions, multi-threading support is not enabled by default. You can check the Julia version with `versioninfo()` command in the REPL.\n\nAlso, please be aware that thread creation and synchronization come with a cost, so for small inputs, this approach might be slower than a single-threaded solution. However, for larger inputs, the benefits of multi-threading can be significant.","status":200,"tokens":[173,385],"elapsed":3.352951417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1098074245,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
