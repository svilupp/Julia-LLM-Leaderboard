[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel, moves all characters before the vowel to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. It iterates over the indices of the input vector and applies the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a vector of strings and pass it to the `pig_latinify` function. The resulting vector of Pig Latin words is then printed to the console.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input vector contains only strings. If the input vector can contain other types of elements, additional error handling may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[324,504],"elapsed":5.88701075,"cost":0.00058932,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":655933574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
