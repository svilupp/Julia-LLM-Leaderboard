Each iteration of the loop is executed in a separate thread. The `findfirst` function is used to find the index of the first vowel in the word. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves all characters before the first vowel to the end and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[101,229],"elapsed":1.339927917,"cost":0.0002405,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-351152587,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
