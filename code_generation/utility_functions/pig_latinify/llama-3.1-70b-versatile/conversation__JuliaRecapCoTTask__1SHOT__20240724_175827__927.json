[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. The `transform_word` function is defined inside `pig_latinify` to transform a single word to Pig Latin.\n3. The `transform_word` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n4. If the word does not start with a vowel, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst`. It then moves all characters before the first vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n5. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. This will create a separate thread for each iteration of the loop.\n6. The transformed words are stored back in the original vector, which is then returned by the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample input vector, like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ananabay\", \"errychay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[325,479],"elapsed":4.957160834,"cost":0.00057016,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-63298094,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
