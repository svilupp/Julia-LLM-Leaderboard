[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. The `transform_word` function is defined inside `pig_latinify` to transform a single word to Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and applies the Pig Latin transformation rules accordingly.\n3. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. This will create a separate thread for each iteration of the loop.\n4. Inside the loop, the `transform_word` function is called for each word in the input vector, and the result is stored back in the original vector.\n5. Finally, the modified vector is returned.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample input vector, like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"appleway\", \"ananabay\"]\n```\nNote that the `Threads.@threads` macro requires Julia 1.3 or later. If you're using an earlier version of Julia, you can use the `pmap` function from the `Distributed` package instead.","status":200,"tokens":[325,475],"elapsed":4.792715042,"cost":0.000567,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1857599335,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
