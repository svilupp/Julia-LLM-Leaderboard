[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

To take advantage of Julia's built-in concurrency, we will use `Threads` to create a separate thread for each iteration.\n\n```julia\n# Import necessary libraries\nusing Base.Threads\n\n# Function to transform a string into Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify_string(str)\n    if str[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return str * \"way\"\n    else\n        return str[2:end] * str[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin using multi-threading\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    n = length(strs)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        results[i] = pig_latinify_string(strs[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Test the pig_latinify function\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"egg\", \"dance\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n\n# Expected Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"appleway\", \"eggay\", \"anceday\"]\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n1. **Concurrent Threads:** By leveraging the multi-threading feature available within the standard Julia `Threads` module, each word transformation process occurs independently without added complexities and yields greater system responsiveness with time-sliced resources that let computation benefit concurrent logic optimization best serving demanding iterative looping events & resulting processed intensive asynchronous patterns fully with diverse processes initiated actively whenever demand input permits workflow events interdependency allowing `Thread`.
