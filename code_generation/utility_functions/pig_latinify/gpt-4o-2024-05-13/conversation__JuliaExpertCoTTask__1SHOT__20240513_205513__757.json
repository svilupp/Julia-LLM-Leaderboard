Define the function `pig_latinify` that accepts a vector of strings.\n2. Create a helper function to transform a single word into Pig Latin.\n3. Use multithreading to transform each word concurrently.\n4. Collect the results and return them.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function Skeleton\n\nFirst, we'll define the skeleton of the `pig_latinify` function.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Placeholder for body of the function\nend\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Helper Function\n\nWe need a helper function to transform a single word into Pig Latin.\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if first_char in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use Multithreading\n\nNext, we use multithreading to run the transformation concurrently.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nHere is the complete code put together:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if first_char in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Solution\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\n### Check the Solution\n\nRunning the test should give:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"trongsay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nAnd this conforms with the Pig Latin transformation rules.","status":200,"tokens":[170,620],"elapsed":6.179604333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1744931150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
