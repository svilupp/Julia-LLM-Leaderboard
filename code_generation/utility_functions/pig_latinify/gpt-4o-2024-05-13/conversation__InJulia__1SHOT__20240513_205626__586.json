Here's a complete example:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\n# Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if first_char in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to convert a vector of strings to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    n = length(words)\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n\n    # Use threading to parallelize the transformation\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\ninput_words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"julia\", \"language\"]\noutput_words = pig_latinify(input_words)\nprintln(output_words)  # Output should be the Pig Latin transformed words\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`to_pig_latin` Function**: This function takes a single word and converts it into Pig Latin according to the rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\".\n\n2. **`pig_latinify` Function**: This function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the words converted into Pig Latin. \n   - It initializes an empty vector to store the results.\n   - It uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over the input vector.\n   - Each thread processes a separate word and stores the result in the corresponding position in the output vector.\n\n3. **Example Usage**: The final section demonstrates how the `pig_latinify` function can be used with a sample list of words. \n\nMake sure you have Julia's threading enabled by running your script with `julia -t <number_of_threads> script_name.jl` or setting `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. For instance, you can set it to `4` by running `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4` in the terminal before executing the script.","status":200,"tokens":[62,534],"elapsed":5.824543583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-745883705,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
