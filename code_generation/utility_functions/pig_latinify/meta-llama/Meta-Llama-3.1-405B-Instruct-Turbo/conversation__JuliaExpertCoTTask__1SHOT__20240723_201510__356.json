The `pig_latinify` function uses Julia's threading capabilities to apply this transformation to each word in the input vector concurrently. The result is a new vector containing the Pig Latin translations of the original words.","status":200,"tokens":[174,368],"elapsed":6.203219667,"cost":0.00639,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-573963120,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
