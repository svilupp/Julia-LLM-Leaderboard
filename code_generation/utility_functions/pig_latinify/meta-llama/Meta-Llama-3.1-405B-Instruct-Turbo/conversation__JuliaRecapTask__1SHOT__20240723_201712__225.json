[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. We create an empty vector `result` to store the transformed words.\n3. We use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over each word in the input vector.\n4. For each word, we check if it starts with a vowel. If it does, we append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n5. If the word does not start with a vowel, we find the index of the first vowel in the word using `findfirst`.\n6. We then move all characters before the first vowel to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n7. If no vowel is found in the word, we simply append \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n8. Finally, we return the vector of transformed words.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"appleway\", \"ananabay\"]\n```\n\n### Double-Checking the Solution\n\nWe can test the solution with different inputs to ensure it produces the correct output. Additionally, we can use Julia's built-in `@test` macro to write unit tests for the function.","status":200,"tokens":[323,518],"elapsed":8.772911709,"cost":0.009385000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1050195803,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
