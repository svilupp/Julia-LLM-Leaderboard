The `pig_latin` function applies the Pig Latin transformation to a single string. The `main` function demonstrates how to use `pig_latinify` with a sample vector of strings.\n\nNote that this code does not use threads explicitly, as Julia's `Threads` module is not designed for parallelizing loops. Instead, it uses Julia's built-in parallelism features, such as multiple CPU cores, to execute the loop concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[101,319],"elapsed":1.98950975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":540537175,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
