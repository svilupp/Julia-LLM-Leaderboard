[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function uses a simple if-else statement to determine whether the first letter of the string is a vowel or not. If it is, the string is simply appended with \"way\". If it's not, the first letter is moved to the end of the string and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nThe `main` function demonstrates how to use `pig_latinify` with a sample vector of strings.\n\nNote that Julia's `Threads` module is used to run each iteration of the loop in a separate thread. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Julia, this will not actually speed up the execution of the code. For true parallelism, you would need to use a more advanced parallel computing library or framework.","status":200,"tokens":[323,351],"elapsed":2.205193417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1297369832,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
