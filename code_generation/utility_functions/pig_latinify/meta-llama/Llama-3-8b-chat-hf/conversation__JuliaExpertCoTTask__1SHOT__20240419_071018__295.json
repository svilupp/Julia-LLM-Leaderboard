The function uses a loop to iterate over each word in the input vector, and for each word, it checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If it doesn't, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". The results are collected in a new vector and returned.\n\nThe code then creates a vector of words and calls the `pig_latinify` function with that vector as input. The result is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[174,291],"elapsed":1.872136417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1316572251,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
