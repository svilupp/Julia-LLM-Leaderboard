The function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each string in the input vector in parallel, which can significantly speed up the conversion process for large input vectors. The function checks if the first letter of each string is a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to the end of the string. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the string and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[174,277],"elapsed":1.827390709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1012027275,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
