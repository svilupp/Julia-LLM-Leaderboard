However, keep in mind that the actual performance benefits of using multiple threads may be limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Julia, which can prevent true parallel execution of threads. For CPU-bound tasks, you may want to consider using Julia's `Distributed` module or other parallelization tools.","status":200,"tokens":[66,482],"elapsed":2.792196,"cost":9.336e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":635437289,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
