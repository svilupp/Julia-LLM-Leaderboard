It defines a helper function `transform` that converts a single word to Pig Latin. The `pig_latinify` function then applies the `transform` function to each word in the input vector, using a loop to collect the results in a new vector. The `Threads` package is used to run each iteration on a separate thread, but in this case, the loop is not parallelized because the `Threads` package is not designed for parallelizing loops.","status":200,"tokens":[174,264],"elapsed":1.683140041,"cost":6.492e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1496575984,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
