[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the processing of each string, which can significantly improve performance for large inputs.\n\nThe function first checks if the string starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends 'way' to the end of the string. If it doesn't, it moves all characters before the first vowel to the end and appends 'ay'.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input strings only contain lowercase letters. If you need to handle uppercase letters or other characters, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[323,409],"elapsed":6.6603195,"cost":0.00010592,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":315347458,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
