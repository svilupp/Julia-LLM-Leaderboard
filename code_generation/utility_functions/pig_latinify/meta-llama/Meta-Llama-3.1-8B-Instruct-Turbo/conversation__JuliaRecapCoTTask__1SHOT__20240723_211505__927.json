[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, I can still write the code based on the problem description.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Define a helper function to convert a single string to Pig Latin\n    function pig_latinify_string(s)\n        # Check if the string starts with a vowel\n        if s[1] ∈ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return s * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the index of the first vowel\n            idx = findfirst(x -> x ∈ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], s)\n            # Return the string with the vowel moved to the end and \"ay\" appended\n            return s[idx:end] * s[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Use Threads.@threads to parallelize the computation\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        strings[i] = pig_latinify_string(strings[i])\n    end\n\n    return strings\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"julia\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(pig_latinified)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with each string converted to Pig Latin. The conversion is done using a helper function `pig_latinify_string`, which checks if the string starts with a vowel and moves the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\" if it doesn't. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the computation, iterating over each string in the input vector in a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[324,382],"elapsed":2.996285166,"cost":0.00010116,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":876909431,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
