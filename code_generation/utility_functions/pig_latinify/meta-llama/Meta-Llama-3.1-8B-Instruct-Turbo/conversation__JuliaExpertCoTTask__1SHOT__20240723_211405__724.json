The transformation is done in a separate function `transform` to keep the code organized. The `transform` function checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". The results are collected in a vector and returned. The code uses a simple loop to apply the transformation to each word, but this could be parallelized using Julia's `Threads` package.","status":200,"tokens":[174,283],"elapsed":2.017882542,"cost":6.834e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1286772465,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
