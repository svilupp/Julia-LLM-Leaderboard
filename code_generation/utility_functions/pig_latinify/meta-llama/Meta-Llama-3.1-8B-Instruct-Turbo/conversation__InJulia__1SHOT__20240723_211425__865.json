The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each string, allowing the function to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n\nNote that the `Threads.@threads` macro is a Julia-specific feature that allows you to parallelize loops using multiple threads. It's a convenient way to write parallel code without having to worry about the underlying threading details.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the performance benefits of parallelizing this code will depend on the size of the input vector and the number of CPU cores available. For small input vectors, the overhead of creating and managing threads may outweigh the benefits of parallelization.","status":200,"tokens":[66,481],"elapsed":3.023856208,"cost":9.318e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-552571217,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
