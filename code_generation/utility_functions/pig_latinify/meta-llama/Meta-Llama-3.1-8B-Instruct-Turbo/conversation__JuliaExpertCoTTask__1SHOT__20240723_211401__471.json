It defines a helper function `pig_latinify_one` that transforms a single string into Pig Latin. The `pig_latinify` function then applies `pig_latinify_one` to each string in the input vector using a loop. The results are stored in a vector and returned.\n\nNote that Julia's `Threads` package is used to enable parallel execution of the loop iterations. However, in this case, the loop iterations are independent and can be executed in parallel, so the `Threads` package is used to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.","status":200,"tokens":[174,326],"elapsed":2.265842917,"cost":7.608e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1553472354,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
