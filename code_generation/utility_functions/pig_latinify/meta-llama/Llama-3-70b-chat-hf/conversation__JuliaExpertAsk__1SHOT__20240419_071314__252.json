Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(strs)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strs)\n        word = strs[i]\n        if isempty(word) || !isletter(word[1])\n            result[i] = word\n        else\n            vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in \"aeiou\", lowercase(word))\n            if vowel_idx === nothing\n                result[i] = word * \"way\"\n            else\n                result[i] = word[vowel_idx:end] * word[1:vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n* We use the `Threads` module to enable parallelism.\n* We create a result vector with the same size as the input vector.\n* We use a `@threads` loop to iterate over each string in the input vector, running each iteration on a separate thread.\n* For each string, we check if it's empty or if the first character is not a letter. If so, we leave the string unchanged.\n* Otherwise, we find the index of the first vowel in the string (using `findfirst` and `lowercase` to make the search case-insensitive).\n* If no vowel is found, we append \"way\" to the end of the string. Otherwise, we move the characters before the vowel to the end of the string and append \"ay\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector only contains strings. If the input vector can contain other types of elements, you may need to add additional error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[101,360],"elapsed":5.436270333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1829381509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
