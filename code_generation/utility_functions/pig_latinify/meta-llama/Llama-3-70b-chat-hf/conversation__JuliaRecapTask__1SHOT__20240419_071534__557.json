[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We first import the `Threads` module, which provides support for multithreading in Julia.\n2. We define the `pig_latinify` function, which takes a vector of strings as input.\n3. We create a result vector with the same size as the input vector using `similar`.\n4. We use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over the input vector. This will distribute the iterations across multiple threads.\n5. Inside the loop, we process each word individually. If the word is empty or doesn't start with a letter, we leave it unchanged.\n6. Otherwise, we find the index of the first vowel in the word using `findfirst`. If no vowel is found, we append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n7. If a vowel is found, we split the word into two parts: the part before the vowel and the part from the vowel onwards. We then swap these parts and append \"ay\" to the end.\n8. Finally, we return the resulting vector of pig latinized words.\n\nNote that we use `AbstractString` as the type parameter for the input vector, which allows the function to work with any type of string (e.g., `String`, `SubString`, etc.). We also use `eachindex` to iterate over the indices of the input vector, which is more efficient than iterating over the values themselves.","status":200,"tokens":[323,445],"elapsed":7.844248125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":699850378,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
