It uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module to parallelize the conversion of each string to Pig Latin. The `to_pig_latin` function is used to perform the actual conversion. The results are stored in a pre-allocated vector and returned at the end.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[174,289],"elapsed":4.880984208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1428708776,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
