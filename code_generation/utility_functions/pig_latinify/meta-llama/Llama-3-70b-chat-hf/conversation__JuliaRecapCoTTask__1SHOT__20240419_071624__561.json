[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. The `transform_word` function is defined inside `pig_latinify`. It takes a single string as input and transforms it into Pig Latin.\n3. The `transform_word` function checks if the input string is empty or if the first character is not a letter. If so, it returns the original string.\n4. It then finds the index of the first vowel in the string. If no vowel is found, it appends \"way\" to the end of the string.\n5. If a vowel is found, it moves all characters before the vowel to the end of the string and appends \"ay\".\n6. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. Each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n7. The results are stored in a new vector, which is returned at the end.\n\nNote that this solution uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module, which is part of the Julia standard library. This allows us to take advantage of multiple cores to speed up the transformation process.","status":200,"tokens":[324,399],"elapsed":4.799989209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-289629915,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
