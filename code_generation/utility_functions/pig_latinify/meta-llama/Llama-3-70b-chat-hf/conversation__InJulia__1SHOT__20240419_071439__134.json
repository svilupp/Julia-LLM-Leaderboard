It splits the string into words, converts each word to Pig Latin, and then joins the words back into a string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_threaded` function takes a vector of strings as input and creates a separate thread for each string using the `@spawn` macro. Each thread calls the `pig_latinify` function to convert the corresponding string to Pig Latin. The results are collected using the `fetch` function and stored in a vector.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a vector of strings and pass it to the `pig_latinify_threaded` function. The resulting vector of Pig Latin strings is printed to the console.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings are relatively short and can be processed independently. If the input strings are very large or require significant processing, you may need to use a more sophisticated parallelization approach.","status":200,"tokens":[66,521],"elapsed":5.818389875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-557035699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
