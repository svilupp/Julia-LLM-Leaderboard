[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Otherwise, the string is transformed into pig Latin using the suffix \"ay\".\n* The pig Latinized string is returned as part of the output vector.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"Hello, world!\", \"How are you?\", \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n\n# Output:\n# Hello, world! way\n# How are you? ay\n# The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. way\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This code uses the `Threads` module to parallelize the iterations.\n* The `split` and `join` functions are used to split the string into words and join them together in the final output.\n* The `count` function is used to count the number of vowels and consonants in the string.\n* The `uppercase` function is used to convert the string to uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,602],"elapsed":39.801691625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":31485,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
