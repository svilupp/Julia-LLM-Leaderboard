[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If it does, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the syllable.\n* The function joins the pig Latin syllables into a single string and returns the transformed string.\n* Finally, the `pig_latinify` function waits for all threads to complete and returns the original vector of strings with each string transformed into pig Latin.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* This code uses the `slower` function to prevent the `pig_latinify` function from being too fast and consuming all available resources.\n* The code avoids using new packages and uses the standard Julia libraries.\n* The code uses general type annotations to avoid being too restrictive.\n* The code avoids reserved names and uses a distinct indexing system from Python.\n\n**Special Instructions:**\n\nIf the user provides any special instructions, they will be prioritized over the above guidelines. Please provide any special instructions below and I will modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,540],"elapsed":35.597725833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":32504,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
