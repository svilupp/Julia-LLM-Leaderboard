[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, the use of threads can introduce overhead, so the overall performance may still be limited by the number of strings in the `strings` vector.\n\n**Clarity:**\n\nThe code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of threads and the `join` function are well-hidden from the user.\n\n**Abstract types:**\n\nThe code does not use any abstract types.\n\n**Multiple dispatch:**\n\nThe code does not use multiple dispatch.\n\n**Reserved names:**\n\nThe code does not use any reserved names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,505],"elapsed":33.412118875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-25686,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
