Here's a concise solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a single word, and another `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings using multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[102,272],"elapsed":6.056371584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1711060595,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
