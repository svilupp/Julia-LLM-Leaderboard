It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow the problem-solving steps to solve this task.\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as an argument.\n   - For each string in the vector, apply the Pig Latin transformation rules:\n     - If a word begins with a consonant, move all initial consonants to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n     - If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"way\" to the end.\n   - Use multi-threading to perform the transformation on each string concurrently.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        consonants = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word) - 1\n        return string(word[consonants+1:end], word[1:consonants], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe output of the function should be `[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[190,436],"elapsed":11.673835583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":424484990,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
