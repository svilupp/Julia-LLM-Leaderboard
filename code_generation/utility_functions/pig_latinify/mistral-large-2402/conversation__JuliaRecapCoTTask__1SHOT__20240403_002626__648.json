[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computing. Here's a simple implementation of a pig latin transformer function called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. Each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines a helper function `to_pig_latin` that converts a single word to pig latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it simply appends \"yay\" to the end. If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function then creates a new vector `pig_latin_words` to store the converted words. It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector in parallel. Each word is converted to pig latin using the `to_pig_latin` function and stored in the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `pig_latin_words` vector.","status":200,"tokens":[370,413],"elapsed":9.402019041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":219759261,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
