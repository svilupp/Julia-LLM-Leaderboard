It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow the problem-solving steps to solve this task.\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as an argument.\n   - For each string in the vector, transform it to pig latin. The rules for transforming to pig latin are:\n     - If a word begins with a consonant, move all initial consonants to the end of the word and add \"ay\" to it.\n     - If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end.\n   - Use multi-threading to perform the transformation on each string concurrently.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if word[1] ∈ vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        consonants = findfirst(x -> x ∈ vowels, word) - 1\n        return string(word[consonants+1:end], word[1:consonants], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe expected output for `pig_latin_words` is `[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`. You can manually check that the function `pig_latinify` correctly transforms each word in the vector to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[190,483],"elapsed":11.190607792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2088283882,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
