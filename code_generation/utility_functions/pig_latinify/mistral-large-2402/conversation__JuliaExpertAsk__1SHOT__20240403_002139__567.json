This code uses the `Threads` module for multithreading. Please note that Julia's multithreading is experimental and its effectiveness can vary based on the number of cores and the nature of the task.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word) || word[1] ∉ 'A':'Z' && word[1] ∉ 'a':'z'\n        return word\n    end\n\n    vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into pig latin. It then defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that applies this transformation to each word in a vector, using multithreading to do so in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[102,348],"elapsed":7.68209025,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1815644804,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
