Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        idx = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function transforms a single word into pig latin. The `pig_latinify_vector` function operates on a vector of strings and uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each string in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[102,289],"elapsed":6.925126125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1757498336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
