In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computing. However, please note that the number of threads used can be influenced by the `Threads.nthreads()` function. Here's a simple implementation of a Pig Latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n    first_letter = word[1]\n\n    if first_letter in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * string(first_letter) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into Pig Latin. Then, it defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that applies this transformation to each word in a vector. The `@threads` macro is used to run each transformation on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[61,336],"elapsed":8.073060416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-542666044,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
