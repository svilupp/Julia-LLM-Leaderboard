[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

In Pig Latin, words are altered by taking the first consonant or consonant cluster of a word, moving it to the end of the word, and adding \"ay\" to it. If a word begins with a vowel, you just add \"way\" to the end.\n\nHere's a basic implementation using Julia's multi-threading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    first_char = word[1]\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n    if first_char in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        index = findfirst(x -> x âˆ‰ vowels, word)\n        if index === nothing\n            return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        else\n            return string(word[(index+1):end], word[1:index], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into Pig Latin. Then it defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that uses Julia's `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in a vector on a separate thread and apply the `pig_latinify` function to it.\n\nPlease note that the actual parallelism and performance improvement you get from this code can depend on various factors, including the number of words in the vector, the length of the words, the number of threads your Julia process is using, and the specifics of your hardware.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that words are either empty or start with a letter. If words can start with non-letter characters, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nLastly, this code does not handle punctuation. If you want to preserve punctuation, you would need to modify the code to handle it. For example, you could add a step that splits each word into a base word and a punctuation string, applies the Pig Latin transformation to the base word, and then recombines the transformed base word and the punctuation string.","status":200,"tokens":[370,609],"elapsed":13.76260275,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":216558077,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
