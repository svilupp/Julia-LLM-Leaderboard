Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, we'll use Julia's multi-threading capabilities along with a simple pig latin transformation function. Here's a concise implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        index = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code snippet contains two functions: `pig_latinify` and `pig_latinify_vector`. The `pig_latinify` function transforms a single word into pig latin, while the `pig_latinify_vector` function operates on a vector of strings and runs the transformation on separate threads using the `@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[102,297],"elapsed":6.936379666,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1180137091,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
