It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, we can use Julia's multi-threading capabilities. Here's a concise implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        idx = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two methods for `pig_latinify`. The first method takes a single string and converts it to pig latin. The second method takes a vector of strings, iterates through each string using multi-threading, and applies the single string `pig_latinify` method to each element.","status":200,"tokens":[102,276],"elapsed":6.207673125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1245121395,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
