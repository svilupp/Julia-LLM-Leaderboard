Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this in Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computation. Here's a simple pig latin transformer function that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if first_letter âˆˆ \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines a helper function `to_pig_latin` that converts a single word to pig latin. Then, it initializes a new vector `pig_latin_words` to store the translated words. It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over the input words in parallel and applies the `to_pig_latin` function to each word, storing the result in `pig_latin_words`. Finally, it returns the vector of pig latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[102,341],"elapsed":7.939974167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-654706133,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
