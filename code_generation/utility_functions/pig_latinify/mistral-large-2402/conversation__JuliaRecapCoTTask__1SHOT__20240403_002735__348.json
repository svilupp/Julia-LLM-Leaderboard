[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you write a Pig Latin transformer in Julia. Pig Latin is a simple language game that involves changing the order of letters in English words. The basic rules are:\n\n1. If a word begins with a consonant, move all initial consonants to the end of the word, and add \"ay\" to the end.\n2. If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"yay\" to the end.\n\nHere's a simple Julia function that follows these rules:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        consonants = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word) - 1\n        return word[consonants+1:end] * word[1:consonants] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, to make this function work on a vector of strings and use multiple threads, we can use Julia's built-in `Threads` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function will iterate over each string in the `words` vector and apply the `pig_latinify` function to it. The `@threads` macro tells Julia to run each iteration on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[370,419],"elapsed":14.919143042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":805561135,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
