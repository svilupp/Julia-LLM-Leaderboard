Here's a simple pig latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        idx = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        return word[idx:end] * word[1:idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two methods for `pig_latinify`. The first one takes a single word and converts it to pig latin. The second one takes a vector of strings and applies the pig latin transformation on each word using separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[102,283],"elapsed":6.953241709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1747577977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
