[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

As there are no special instructions provided, I'll follow the general guidelines for Julia programming. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    if isempty(word) || word[1] âˆˆ ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `pig_latinify` is a function that transforms a single word into Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"yay\" to the end of the word. If it doesn't, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n- `pig_latinify_vector` is a function that operates on a vector of strings. It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each string in the vector on a separate thread. Each string is transformed into Pig Latin using the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[370,374],"elapsed":8.569231375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-571102042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
