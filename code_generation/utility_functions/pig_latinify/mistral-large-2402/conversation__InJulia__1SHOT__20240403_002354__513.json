This version of the transformer will move the first consonant cluster of each word to the end and add \"ay\" to it. If a word starts with a vowel, it will just add \"way\" to the end. Please note that this is a simplified version of Pig Latin and may not cover all the rules.\n\nIn Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computation. However, please note that Julia's threading model is designed for IO and random access tasks, and may not provide speedup for this kind of task due to the cost of threading overhead.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    vowels = Set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n    first_vowel_index = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n\n    if first_vowel_index === 1\n        return word * \"way\"\n    elseif first_vowel_index === nothing\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nYou can use `pig_latinify_vector` to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin. This function will iterate over each string in the vector and change it to Pig Latin. Each iteration will run on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[61,425],"elapsed":10.934537125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1249424432,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
