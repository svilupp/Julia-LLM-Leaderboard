In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computation. Here's a simple implementation of a Pig Latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n\n        if first_letter in 'aeiou'\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function defines a helper function `to_pig_latin` that converts a single word to Pig Latin. It then uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over the words in the input vector, converting each one to Pig Latin in a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[61,280],"elapsed":6.779449916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1528436137,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
