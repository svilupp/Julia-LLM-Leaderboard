In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computation. However, please note that the number of threads used can be influenced by the `Threads.nthreads()` function. Here's a simple implementation of a Pig Latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into Pig Latin. Then it defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that applies this transformation to each word in a vector, using multiple threads for the transformation.","status":200,"tokens":[61,277],"elapsed":6.690302417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1057341423,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
