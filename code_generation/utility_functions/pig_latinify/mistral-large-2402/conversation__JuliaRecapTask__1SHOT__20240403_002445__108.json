[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

In pig latin, the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is added. If a word begins with a vowel, \"way\" is added to the end of the word instead.\n\nHere's a simple way to do it using multiple threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    first_char = word[1]\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n    if first_char in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        vowel_index = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(vowel_index)\n            return string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            return string(word[vowel_index:end], word[1:vowel_index-1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector)::AbstractVector\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function for a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and appends \"way\" if it does. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the first vowel, moves the consonants before it to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe second `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over the words in parallel. Each iteration runs on a separate thread, as requested. The transformed words are stored back into the original vector.","status":200,"tokens":[368,497],"elapsed":11.16991625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1033428407,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
