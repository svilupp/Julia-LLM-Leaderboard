This code uses the `Threads` module for parallel computation. Please note that Julia's threading model is designed for CPU-bound tasks, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific use case.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word) || word[1] âˆˆ ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into pig latin. It then defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that applies this transformation to each word in a vector. The `@threads` macro is used to run each iteration of the loop in a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[102,306],"elapsed":7.490277583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1742727863,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
