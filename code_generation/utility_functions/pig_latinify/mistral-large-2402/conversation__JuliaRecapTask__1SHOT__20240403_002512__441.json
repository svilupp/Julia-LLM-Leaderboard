[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n\n    if first_letter in 'aeiouAEIOU'\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}\n    result = similar(words)\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word into pig latin. It then defines a `pig_latinify_vector` function that uses Julia's `@threads` macro to apply the `pig_latinify` function to each word in a vector in parallel.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"yay\" to the end of the word. If it's not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify_vector` function creates a new vector of the same size as the input vector, and then uses a for loop with the `@threads` macro to fill this new vector with the pig latin versions of the words in the input vector. The `@threads` macro tells Julia to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note that the actual performance improvement from using multiple threads can vary depending on the number of words, the length of the words, and the number of threads your system supports. Julia's threading model is designed to be efficient on systems with a large number of threads.\n\nAlso, this is a simple implementation of pig latin and may not handle all edge cases (like punctuation, numbers, or words that start with multiple consonants). If you need to handle these cases, you may need to modify the `pig_latinify` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[368,568],"elapsed":14.741310792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-368842144,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
