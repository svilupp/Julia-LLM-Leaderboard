[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

In Julia, you can use the `@threads` macro for parallel computing. Here's a simple implementation of a pig latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis code first defines a `pig_latinify` function that converts a single word to pig latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"yay\" to the end. If it starts with a consonant, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe second `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and applies the single-word `pig_latinify` function to each element in parallel using the `@threads` macro. The `eachindex` function is used to get a collection of indices that can be iterated over.","status":200,"tokens":[368,374],"elapsed":10.32962725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-689785809,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
