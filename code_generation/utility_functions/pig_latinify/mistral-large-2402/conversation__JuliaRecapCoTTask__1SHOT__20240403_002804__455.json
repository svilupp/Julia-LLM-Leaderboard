X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

As you didn't provide any special instructions, I'll follow the general guidelines you provided.\n\nIn Pig Latin, a word is transformed by moving the first letter to the end and adding \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, \"yay\" is simply added to the end.\n\nHere's a simple implementation using Julia's multi-threading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})::Vector{<:AbstractString}\n    result = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `pig_latinify` is a function that transforms a single word into Pig Latin.\n- `pig_latinify_vector` is a function that transforms a vector of words into Pig Latin. It uses the `@threads` macro to run each transformation on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note that the actual number of threads used depends on the number of threads your Julia instance is set to use, which you can check with `Threads.nthreads()`.\n\nRemember to double-check the solution and make sure it works as expected. You might want to test it with a variety of inputs, including words that start with vowels, words that start with consonants, and empty strings.","status":200,"tokens":[370,431],"elapsed":15.061296625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1391885551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
