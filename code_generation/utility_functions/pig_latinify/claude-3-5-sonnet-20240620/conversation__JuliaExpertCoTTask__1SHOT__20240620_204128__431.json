Define the pig_latinify function\n2. Create a helper function to convert a single word to pig latin\n3. Use multi-threading to process each word\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the pig latin versions of each word. It uses the `@threads` macro to process each word on a separate thread, potentially speeding up the transformation for large inputs.\n\nThe `to_pig_latin` helper function handles the actual transformation of each word according to the pig latin rules:\n- If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n- If the word starts with a consonant, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n- If the word contains no vowels, just add \"ay\" to the end.\n\nThis solution should correctly transform the input vector to pig latin using multi-threading.","status":200,"tokens":[174,513],"elapsed":7.202911958,"cost":0.008217,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27607,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
