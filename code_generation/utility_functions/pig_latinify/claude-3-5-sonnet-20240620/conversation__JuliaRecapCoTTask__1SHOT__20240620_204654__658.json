X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'll write a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings, changing each string to pig latin using separate threads for each iteration. Let me break down the solution into steps:\n\n1. First, I'll define a helper function to convert a single word to pig latin.\n2. Then, I'll create the main `pig_latinify` function that uses multi-threading to process each word.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. The `to_pig_latin` function:\n   - Handles empty strings, words starting with vowels, and words starting with consonants.\n   - Uses lowercase comparison for vowel checking to handle capitalized words.\n   - Adds \"way\" to words starting with vowels.\n   - For words starting with consonants, it finds the first vowel and moves all consonants before it to the end, then adds \"ay\".\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function:\n   - Takes a vector of strings as input.\n   - Creates a similar vector to store the results.\n   - Uses `@threads` macro to parallelize the for loop, processing each word on a separate thread.\n   - Calls `to_pig_latin` for each word and stores the result.\n\nThis implementation should efficiently transform a vector of strings to pig latin using multiple threads. The use of `AbstractString` allows for different string types to be used.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe function will automatically use as many threads as are available to Julia, which you can control by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line argument when starting Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[346,708],"elapsed":10.209834666,"cost":0.011658000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32647,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
