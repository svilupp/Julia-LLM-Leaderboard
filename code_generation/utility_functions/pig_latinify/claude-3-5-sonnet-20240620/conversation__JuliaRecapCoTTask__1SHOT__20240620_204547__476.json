X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'll create a pig latin transformer function called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings, transforming each string to pig latin using separate threads. Let me solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets:\n\n- Threads: `Threads.@threads for ... end`\n- String operations: `startswith`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `first`, `SubString`\n- Vector operations: `map`, `collect`\n\nNow, let's solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    \n    if isempty(word) || startswith(word, vowels)\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> char in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that transforms a single word to pig latin:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, we simply append \"ay\" to the end.\n   - If it starts with a consonant, we move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and append \"ay\".\n   - We handle edge cases like empty strings or words without vowels.\n\n2. The main `pig_latinify` function:\n   - Takes a vector of strings as input.\n   - Creates a similar vector to store the results.\n   - Uses `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in parallel.\n   - Applies the `to_pig_latin` function to each word and stores the result.\n\nThis solution meets the requirements:\n- It operates on a vector of strings.\n- It transforms each string to pig latin.\n- Each iteration runs on a separate thread using `@threads`.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient as it utilizes multiple threads for parallel processing, which can significantly speed up the transformation for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[346,650],"elapsed":9.251771875,"cost":0.010788,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17131,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
