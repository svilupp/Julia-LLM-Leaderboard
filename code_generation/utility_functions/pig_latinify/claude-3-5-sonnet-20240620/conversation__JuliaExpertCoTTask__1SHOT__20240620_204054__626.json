Define the pig_latinify function\n2. Create a helper function to convert a single word to pig latin\n3. Use multi-threading to process each word\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function\ninput = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\noutput = pig_latinify(input)\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nLet's check if the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\n# Expected output:\n# [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n\n@assert output == [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\nprintln(\"Test passed!\")\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly transform the input vector of strings into pig latin, with each word being processed on a separate thread for improved performance.","status":200,"tokens":[174,425],"elapsed":6.268424958,"cost":0.006897,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31066,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
