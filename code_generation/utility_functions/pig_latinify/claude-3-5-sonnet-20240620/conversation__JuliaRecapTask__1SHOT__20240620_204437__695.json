[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        consonant_cluster = findnext(c -> lowercase(c) in vowels, word, 1)\n        if isnothing(consonant_cluster)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[consonant_cluster:end] * word[1:consonant_cluster-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We import `Base.Threads` to use multi-threading capabilities.\n\n2. We define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that transforms a single word to Pig Latin:\n   - If the word is empty, return it as is.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, move the consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\".\n\n3. The main `pig_latinify` function:\n   - Takes a vector of strings as input.\n   - Creates a similar vector to store the results.\n   - Uses `@threads` macro to iterate over the input words in parallel.\n   - Applies the `to_pig_latin` function to each word and stores the result.\n   - Returns the vector of transformed words.\n\nThis implementation satisfies the requirements:\n- It operates on a vector of strings.\n- It transforms each string to Pig Latin.\n- It uses multi-threading to process each word on a separate thread.\n\nTo use this function, make sure to set the number of threads Julia can use before running your script. You can do this by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by starting Julia with the `--threads` flag.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\n# Set number of threads (if not set through environment variable or command line)\nThreads.nthreads() == 1 && Threads.nthreads(Sys.CPU_THREADS)\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\", \"language\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\", \"anguagelay\"]\n```\n\nThe solution is correct and efficiently uses multi-threading to process the input vector of strings in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[345,729],"elapsed":10.031065625,"cost":0.01197,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24798,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
