[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'll write a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin, using multiple threads for parallel processing. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the implementation:\n\n1. We define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that transforms a single word into Pig Latin:\n   - If the word is empty, return it as is.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n   - If there are no vowels, just add \"ay\" to the end.\n\n2. The main `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input:\n   - We create a `result` vector of the same size as the input to store the transformed words.\n   - We use `@threads` macro to parallelize the for loop, processing each word on a separate thread.\n   - Inside the loop, we transform each word using `to_pig_latin` and store it in the `result` vector.\n\n3. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing all the transformed words.\n\nThis implementation utilizes Julia's built-in threading capabilities to process each word in parallel, which can significantly speed up the transformation for large input vectors.\n\nTo use this function, make sure you start Julia with multiple threads (e.g., `julia -t 4` for 4 threads). Then you can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe function works with any subtype of `AbstractString`, providing flexibility for different string types, and uses abstract types for better performance and generality.","status":200,"tokens":[345,693],"elapsed":10.815287625,"cost":0.01143,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19310,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
