The `@threads` macro distributes the iterations of the loop across available threads. Each word is processed independently, making it suitable for parallel execution.","status":200,"tokens":[95,269],"elapsed":4.373530083,"cost":0.00432,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
