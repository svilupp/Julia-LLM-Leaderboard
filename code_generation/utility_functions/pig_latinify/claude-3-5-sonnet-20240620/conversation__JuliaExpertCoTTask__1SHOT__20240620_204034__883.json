Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings\n2. Create a helper function to convert a single word to pig latin\n3. Use multi-threading to process each word in parallel\n4. Collect and return the results\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction word_to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = word_to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function\ninput = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\noutput = pig_latinify(input)\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nLet's check if the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\n# Expected output:\n# [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n\n@assert pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) == [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\nprintln(\"Test passed!\")\n```\n\nThis implementation satisfies the requirements:\n1. It defines a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings.\n2. It transforms each string to pig latin.\n3. Each iteration runs on a separate thread using `@threads`.\n\nThe solution is correct and efficient, utilizing Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[174,515],"elapsed":7.324982416,"cost":0.008247,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27654,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
