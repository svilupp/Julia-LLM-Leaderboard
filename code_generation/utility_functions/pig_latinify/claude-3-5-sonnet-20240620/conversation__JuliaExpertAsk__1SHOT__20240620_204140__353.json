The `to_pig_latin` function handles the transformation for individual words, while `pig_latinify` applies it to the entire vector in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[95,277],"elapsed":4.002103125,"cost":0.0044399999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24674,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
