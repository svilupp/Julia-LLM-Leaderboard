Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of a multi-threaded pig latin transformer in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if isempty(word) || word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        first_vowel === nothing && return word * \"ay\"\n        return word[first_vowel:end] * word[1:first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses `Base.Threads` for multi-threading. The `@threads` macro distributes the iterations across available threads. The `to_pig_latin` function handles the conversion of individual words to pig latin, while `pig_latinify` applies this transformation to each word in the input vector concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[95,283],"elapsed":4.097791708,"cost":0.00453,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28624,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
