[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We import `Base.Threads` to use multi-threading capabilities.\n\n2. We define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that transforms a single word to pig latin:\n   - If the word is empty, return it as is.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n   - If there are no vowels, just add \"ay\" to the end.\n\n3. The main `pig_latinify` function:\n   - Takes a vector of strings as input.\n   - Creates a new vector `result` of the same size and type as the input.\n   - Uses `@threads` macro to iterate over the input words in parallel.\n   - Each thread calls `to_pig_latin` on its assigned word and stores the result.\n   - Returns the vector of transformed words.\n\nThis implementation ensures that each word transformation runs on a separate thread, potentially improving performance for large inputs. The use of `AbstractString` allows for different string types to be used.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nNote that the actual parallelization will depend on the number of available threads. You can set the number of threads by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before starting Julia, or by starting Julia with the `--threads` option.","status":200,"tokens":[346,689],"elapsed":9.907577542,"cost":0.011373000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22360,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
