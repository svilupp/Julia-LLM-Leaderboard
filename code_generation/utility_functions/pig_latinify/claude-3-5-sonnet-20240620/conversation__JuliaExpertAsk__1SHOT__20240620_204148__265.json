The `to_pig_latin` function handles the conversion of individual words, while `pig_latinify` applies this transformation to each word in the input vector using separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[95,279],"elapsed":4.144203875,"cost":0.00447,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24007,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
