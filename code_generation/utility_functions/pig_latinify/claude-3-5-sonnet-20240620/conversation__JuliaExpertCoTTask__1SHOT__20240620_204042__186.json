Define the pig latin transformation function\n2. Create the main `pig_latinify` function that uses multi-threading\n3. Implement the solution\n4. Test the solution\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if lowercase(word[1]) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(char -> lowercase(char) in vowels, word)\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_index)\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function\ninput = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\noutput = pig_latinify(input)\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nThis solution does the following:\n\n1. We define a `to_pig_latin` function that transforms a single word to pig latin.\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, creates a result vector of the same length, and uses `Threads.@threads` to process each word in parallel.\n3. Each thread calls `to_pig_latin` on its assigned word and stores the result in the corresponding index of the `result` vector.\n4. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing all the transformed words.\n\nTo test the solution, we can run the provided example:\n\n```julia\ninput = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\noutput = pig_latinify(input)\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nThe expected output should be:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently transforms the input vector to pig latin using multi-threading, with each word being processed on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[174,557],"elapsed":7.65083775,"cost":0.008877,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8596,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
