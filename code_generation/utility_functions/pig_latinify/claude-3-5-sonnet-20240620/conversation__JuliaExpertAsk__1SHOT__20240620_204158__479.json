Creates a new vector `result` to store transformed words.\n2. Uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over word indices.\n3. Handles empty strings and words starting with vowels.\n4. Transforms non-empty words starting with consonants to pig latin.\n\nTo use it:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nEnsure you've set the desired number of threads using `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or `julia --threads N` when starting Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[95,341],"elapsed":5.321449875,"cost":0.005399999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1965,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
