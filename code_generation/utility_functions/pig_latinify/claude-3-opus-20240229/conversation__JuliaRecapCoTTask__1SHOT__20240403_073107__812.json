[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

This allows it to handle any string type.\n\n- Inside, it defines a nested `transform_word` function that handles the pig latin transformation for a single word. \n  - If the word starts with a vowel (checked with a case-insensitive regex `^[aeiou]`), it just appends \"way\". \n  - Else, it uses `match` and capturing groups to split the word into the consonant cluster and rest, and rearranges with \"ay\" appended.\n\n- The main function preallocates a `Vector{String}` of the same length to store the results.\n\n- It then uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over the input words. Each iteration calls `transform_word` on the word at index `i` and stores the result in the same index in `pig_latin_words`.\n\n- Finally it returns the vector of transformed words.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"pig\", \"latin\", \"simple\", \"ice\", \"cream\"]\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"pig\"\n \"latin\"\n \"simple\"\n \"ice\"\n \"cream\"\n\njulia> pig_latinify(words)\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"igpay\"\n \"atinlay\"\n \"implesay\"\n \"iceway\"\n \"eamcray\"\n```\n\nThe multithreading with `Threads.@threads` will automatically utilize multiple cores if available to speed up the computation on large input vectors. The function uses abstract types where possible for flexibility.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[346,587],"elapsed":36.671115167,"cost":0.049214999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14451,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
