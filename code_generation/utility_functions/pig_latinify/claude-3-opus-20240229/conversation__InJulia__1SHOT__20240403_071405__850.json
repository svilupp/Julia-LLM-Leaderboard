The `transform_word` function takes a single word as input and converts it to Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant or consonant cluster, it moves the consonant(s) to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. The `process_chunk` function takes a chunk of words (a subvector) and applies the `transform_word` function to each word in the chunk, returning the transformed chunk.\n\n3. We determine the number of available threads using `Threads.nthreads()`.\n\n4. We calculate the chunk size by dividing the total number of words by the number of threads and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n\n5. We split the input vector `words` into chunks based on the chunk size using array comprehension.\n\n6. We create an empty vector `results` to store the transformed chunks.\n\n7. We use `Threads.@threads` to iterate over each chunk in parallel. Each iteration processes a chunk using the `process_chunk` function and appends the transformed chunk to the `results` vector.\n\n8. Finally, we concatenate all the transformed chunks using `vcat` and return the resulting vector of Pig Latin words.\n\nYou can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings, and it will return the transformed vector with each word converted to Pig Latin. The transformation process will be distributed across multiple threads for improved performance.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled (e.g., using the `-t` option) to take advantage of the parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[58,747],"elapsed":31.285119583,"cost":0.056895,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15760,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
