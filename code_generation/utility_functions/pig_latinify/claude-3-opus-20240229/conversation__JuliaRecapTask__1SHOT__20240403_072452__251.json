[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, a nested `transform_word` function is defined. This function takes a single word as input and transforms it into pig latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it returns an empty string.\n   - If the first character of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), it appends \"yay\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\n3. A new vector `pig_latin_words` is initialized with the same length as the input `words` vector to store the transformed pig latin words.\n\n4. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel using multiple threads. The `eachindex` function is used to get the indices of the vector.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, each word is transformed using the `transform_word` function and stored in the corresponding index of the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n\n6. Finally, the `pig_latin_words` vector containing the transformed pig latin words is returned.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"OpenAI\", \"Julia\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"OpenAIyay\", \"uliajay\"]\n```\n\nThis solution utilizes multithreading to process each word in parallel, potentially improving performance for larger input vectors. The `Threads.@threads` macro automatically distributes the iterations across available threads.\n\nNote: Multithreading in Julia requires setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or starting Julia with the `-t` flag to specify the number of threads to use.","status":200,"tokens":[345,649],"elapsed":25.593274583,"cost":0.053849999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7700,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
