The `transform_word` function takes a single word as input and transforms it into pig latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character of the word (converted to lowercase) is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), the word is returned with \"yay\" appended to the end.\n   - Otherwise, the word is transformed by moving the first character to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\n2. The `process_word` function takes an index `i` and updates the corresponding word in the `words` vector by applying the `transform_word` function to it.\n\n3. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel. It spawns multiple threads, and each thread executes the `process_word` function for a different index.\n\n4. Finally, the modified `words` vector is returned.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass a vector of strings to `pig_latinify`, and it will return a new vector with each word transformed into pig latin. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\", \"language\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"rogrammingpay\", \"anguagelay\"]\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled to take advantage of the parallel processing. You can do this by starting Julia with the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option, specifying the desired number of threads. For example: `julia -t 4 your_script.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[58,637],"elapsed":26.405744041,"cost":0.048645,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25681,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
