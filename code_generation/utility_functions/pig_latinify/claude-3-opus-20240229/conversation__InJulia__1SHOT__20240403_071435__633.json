The `transform_word` function takes a single word as input and converts it to Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it returns the empty word.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), it appends \"yay\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. The `process_words` function is a helper function that takes the input words, the result vector, and an index. It transforms the word at the given index using the `transform_word` function and stores the result in the corresponding position of the result vector.\n\n3. The `pig_latinify` function is the main function that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with each string converted to Pig Latin.\n   - It initializes a result vector `result` of the same length as the input words.\n   - It also initializes a vector of tasks `threads` of the same length as the input words.\n\n4. The function then iterates over the indices of the words using a `for` loop:\n   - For each index `i`, it spawns a new thread using `Threads.@spawn` and calls the `process_words` function with the input words, result vector, and the current index.\n\n5. After spawning all the threads, the function waits for each thread to finish using the `wait` function.\n\n6. Finally, the function returns the `result` vector containing the Pig Latin transformed words.\n\nThis implementation utilizes Julia's built-in threading capabilities to process each word in a separate thread, allowing for parallel execution and potentially faster processing of large vectors of strings.\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled (e.g., using the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or the `-t` command-line flag) to take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[58,749],"elapsed":29.643028583,"cost":0.057045,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23703,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
