The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested function called `transform_word` that takes a single word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), the word is appended with \"way\".\n   - If the first character of the word is a consonant, the first character is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n3. We create a new vector called `result` with the same length as the input `words` vector to store the transformed words.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel using separate threads. The `eachindex(words)` function returns an iterator over the indices of the `words` vector.\n\n5. Inside the parallel loop, we apply the `transform_word` function to each word at the corresponding index and store the result in the `result` vector at the same index.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the transformed words in Pig Latin.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"rogrammingpay\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pig_latinify` function is called with a vector of words. Each word is transformed into Pig Latin using separate threads, and the resulting vector of transformed words is printed.\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled (e.g., using the `-t` flag or setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable) to take advantage of parallel execution.","status":200,"tokens":[58,674],"elapsed":27.003228,"cost":0.05142,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18707,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
