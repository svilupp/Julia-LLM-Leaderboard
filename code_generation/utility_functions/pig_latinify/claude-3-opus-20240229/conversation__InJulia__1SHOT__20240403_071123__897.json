The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings called `words` as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested function called `transform_word` that takes a single word as input and transforms it into pig latin. The transformation logic is as follows:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character of the word (converted to lowercase) is a vowel (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), the word is returned with \"way\" appended to it.\n   - Otherwise, the first character is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended to it.\n\n3. We also define another nested function called `process_word` that takes an index `i` as input. This function updates the `i`-th element of the `words` vector by transforming it using the `transform_word` function.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel. The `@threads` macro automatically distributes the iterations across available threads.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, we call the `process_word` function with the current index `i`. This ensures that each word is processed on a separate thread.\n\n6. Finally, the modified `words` vector is returned.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled to take advantage of parallel execution. You can do this by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by starting Julia with the `-t` flag followed by the desired number of threads (e.g., `julia -t 4`).","status":200,"tokens":[58,676],"elapsed":27.620871833,"cost":0.05157,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
