The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform_word` function that takes a single word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), the word is appended with \"way\".\n   - Otherwise, the first character is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n3. We create a new vector `result` to store the transformed words. The size of `result` is set to the same length as `words`.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the iteration over each word in `words`. The `@threads` macro automatically distributes the iterations among the available threads.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, we call the `transform_word` function for each word and store the transformed word in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the transformed words.\n\nThis implementation utilizes Julia's multithreading capabilities to process each word in parallel, potentially improving the performance for large vectors of strings.\n\nNote: To enable multithreading in Julia, you need to start Julia with multiple threads using the `-t` or `--threads` flag, e.g., `julia -t auto` or `julia --threads=4`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function transforms each word in the input vector into Pig Latin using separate threads for each iteration, and returns the vector of transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[95,658],"elapsed":25.910788708,"cost":0.050775,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6179,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
