[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a vector of transformed strings.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform` function that takes a single word as input and returns its pig latin transformation. It checks if the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive) using `occursin` with a regular expression `r\"^[aeiou]\"i`. If so, it appends \"way\" to the word. Otherwise, it uses `match` to split the word into consonants and the rest, and rearranges them with \"ay\" appended.\n\n3. We get the length of the input `words` vector and initialize a `results` vector of the same length to store the transformed words.\n\n4. We use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over the input words. Each iteration runs on a separate thread. Inside the loop, we call the `transform` function on each word and store the result in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the pig latin transformed words.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\ntransformed = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution utilizes Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities with `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word. This can provide performance improvements when dealing with a large number of words.\n\nNote: Make sure to start Julia with multiple threads enabled (e.g., `julia -t auto` or set the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable) to take advantage of multi-threading.","status":200,"tokens":[346,614],"elapsed":30.714161125,"cost":0.051239999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-26363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
