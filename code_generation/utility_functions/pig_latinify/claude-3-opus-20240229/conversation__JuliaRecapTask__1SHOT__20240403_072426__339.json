[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform` function that takes a single word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), the word is appended with \"way\".\n   - If the first character is a consonant, the first character is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n3. We create a new vector `transformed` with the same length as the input vector `words` to store the transformed words.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to distribute the iterations of the `for` loop across multiple threads. Each thread will process a subset of the words independently.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, we iterate over each word in `words` using `eachindex`. For each word, we call the `transform` function to transform it into Pig Latin and store the result in the corresponding index of the `transformed` vector.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `transformed` vector containing the Pig Latin words.\n\nNote: The `Threads.@threads` macro requires Julia to be started with multiple threads enabled. You can do this by running Julia with the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option, e.g., `julia -t 4` to start Julia with 4 threads.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nBy using multiple threads, the transformation of each word can be performed concurrently, potentially improving the performance of the `pig_latinify` function, especially for large vectors of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[345,657],"elapsed":29.788311667,"cost":0.05444999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2761,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
