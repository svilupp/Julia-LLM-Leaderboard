We create a new vector called `result` with the same length as the input vector `words` to store the pig latin transformations.\n\n2. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel. This macro automatically distributes the iterations among available threads.\n\n3. Inside the loop, we process each word as follows:\n   - If the word is empty, we store an empty string in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n   - Otherwise, we check the first character of the word (converted to lowercase):\n     - If the first character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), we append \"yay\" to the end of the word and store it in the `result` vector.\n     - If the first character is a consonant, we extract all the consonants at the beginning of the word and store them in the `consonants` variable. We then move the remaining part of the word (starting from the first vowel) to the beginning, append the extracted consonants, and finally append \"ay\" to form the pig latin transformation. We store the transformed word in the `result` vector.\n\n4. After processing all the words, we return the `result` vector containing the pig latin transformations.\n\nNote: Make sure to add the `using Threads` statement at the beginning of your code to enable multi-threading support in Julia.\n\nYou can use the `pig_latinify` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe pig latin transformation will be performed on each word in the `words` vector, with each iteration running on a separate thread for improved performance.","status":200,"tokens":[58,696],"elapsed":28.854718458,"cost":0.05307,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30742,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
