The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform` function that converts a single word to Pig Latin. It follows these rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (checked using `first_char in \"aeiouAEIOU\"`), the word is appended with \"way\".\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, the first letter is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the `words` vector using multiple threads. This allows for parallel processing of the words.\n\n4. Inside the threaded loop, we apply the `transform` function to each word in the `words` vector, updating the word in-place with its Pig Latin equivalent.\n\n5. Finally, the modified `words` vector is returned.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass a vector of strings to `pig_latinify`, and it will return the vector with each string converted to Pig Latin. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to enable multi-threading in Julia by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or using the `-t` flag when starting the Julia REPL. For example, `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4` or `julia -t 4`.","status":200,"tokens":[58,589],"elapsed":26.121878875,"cost":0.045045,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11616,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
