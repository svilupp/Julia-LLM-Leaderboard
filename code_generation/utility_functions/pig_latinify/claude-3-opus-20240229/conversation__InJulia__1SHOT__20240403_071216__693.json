We define a nested function called `transform_word` that takes a single word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant or consonant cluster, it moves the consonant(s) to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. We create a new vector called `result` with the same size and type as the input vector `words`. This will store the transformed Pig Latin words.\n\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over the indices of `words`. This macro automatically distributes the iterations among available threads.\n\n4. Inside the loop, we apply the `transform_word` function to each word in `words` and store the transformed word in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the Pig Latin words.\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, you can pass a vector of strings as input. Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a vector of words `[\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]`. We pass this vector to the `pig_latinify` function, which transforms each word into Pig Latin using multithreading. The resulting Pig Latin words are stored in the `pig_latin_words` vector and printed.\n\nNote that to enable multithreading in Julia, you need to start Julia with multiple threads using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option, or by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.","status":200,"tokens":[58,633],"elapsed":25.754643667,"cost":0.048345,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-791,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
