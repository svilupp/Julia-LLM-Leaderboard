[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `transform_word` inner function takes a single word as an `AbstractString` and transforms it into pig latin:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, it splits the word into two parts: the consonant cluster at the beginning and the rest of the word. It then reorders them and appends \"ay\" at the end.\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of words as `AbstractString`s.\n\n3. It initializes a results vector `results` with the same length as the input words vector to store the transformed pig latin words.\n\n4. It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the words vector in parallel using multiple threads. Within each iteration:\n   - It calls the `transform_word` function to transform the current word into pig latin.\n   - It assigns the transformed word to the corresponding index in the `results` vector.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the `results` vector containing the transformed pig latin words.\n\nThe solution uses the `AbstractString` type for generality, allowing it to work with different string types. It also uses regular expressions for concise pattern matching and transformation logic.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to automatically distribute the loop iterations across available threads, enabling parallel execution for better performance on multi-core systems.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution transforms each word in the input vector into its pig latin equivalent using separate threads and returns the resulting vector of transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[346,637],"elapsed":29.939156292,"cost":0.052965,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31716,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
