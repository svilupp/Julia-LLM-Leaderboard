We define an inner function called `transform_word` that takes a single word as input and transforms it into Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), \"way\" is appended to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, the first letter is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n2. We create a new vector called `result` to store the transformed words. The vector is initialized with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each word in the `words` vector. This macro automatically distributes the iterations across available threads.\n\n4. Inside the loop, we call the `transform_word` function on each word and store the transformed word in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the transformed words in Pig Latin.\n\nNote: Make sure to run Julia with multiple threads enabled to take advantage of the multithreading capability. You can do this by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by starting Julia with the `-t` flag followed by the number of threads you want to use.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function efficiently transforms the vector of strings into Pig Latin by utilizing multithreading to process each word concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[95,656],"elapsed":26.841864791,"cost":0.050624999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
