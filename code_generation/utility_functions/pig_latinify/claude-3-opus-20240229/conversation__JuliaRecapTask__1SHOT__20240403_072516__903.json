[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input. The element type of the vector is specified as `<:AbstractString`, which means any subtype of `AbstractString`.\n\n2. Inside the function, a nested `transform` function is defined. This function takes a single string (`word`) as input and applies the pig latin transformation rules:\n   - If the first character of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, it moves the first character to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n3. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to iterate over each index of the `words` vector using separate threads. This allows for parallel processing of the pig latin transformation.\n\n4. Inside the threaded loop, the `transform` function is called on each word in the `words` vector, and the result is assigned back to the corresponding position in the vector.\n\n5. Finally, the modified `words` vector is returned.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the computation across multiple threads, which can improve performance when working with large vectors of strings.\n\nNote: Make sure to start Julia with multiple threads enabled (e.g., using the `-t` flag or setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable) to take advantage of the parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[345,549],"elapsed":24.771493417,"cost":0.046349999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18666,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
