[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a `Vector` of `String`s as input and returns a new `Vector` of `String`s with each word converted to Pig Latin.\n\n2. Inside `pig_latinify`, we define a nested function `transform_word` that takes a single `String` and returns its Pig Latin equivalent:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), we append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant (or consonant cluster), we use a regular expression to split the word into the consonant part and the rest. We then move the consonant part to the end and append \"ay\".\n\n3. We initialize a new `Vector` called `result` with the same length as the input `words` vector to store the transformed words.\n\n4. We use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the iteration over each word in `words`. This macro automatically distributes the iterations across available threads.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, we call `transform_word` on each word and store the result in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the Pig Latin words.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThis solution leverages Julia's built-in threading capabilities with `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word, potentially improving performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[346,572],"elapsed":26.130003125,"cost":0.048089999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29099,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
