We define an inner function `transform_word` that takes a single string (`word`) as input and transforms it into Pig Latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word is empty, return an empty string.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n   - If the word doesn't match any of the above rules, return the word as is.\n\n2. We create a new vector `result` to store the transformed words. The vector is preallocated with the same length as the input vector `words`.\n\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word. The `for` loop iterates over the indices of `words` using `eachindex(words)`.\n\n4. Inside the loop, we apply the `transform_word` function to each word in `words` and store the transformed word in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the transformed words in Pig Latin.\n\nBy using `Threads.@threads`, each iteration of the loop is executed on a separate thread, allowing for parallel processing of the words. This can potentially speed up the transformation process, especially for large vectors of words.\n\nNote: Make sure to start Julia with multiple threads using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option to enable multi-threading, e.g., `julia -t auto script.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[95,604],"elapsed":24.367553875,"cost":0.046724999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":7987,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
