[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latin` helper function takes a single word (a string) and transforms it to Pig Latin:\n   - It finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst` and a predicate that checks if a character is in the set of vowels (\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n   - If no vowel is found, it adds \"ay\" to the end \n   - If the first letter is a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end\n   - Otherwise, it moves the consonant cluster before the first vowel to the end and adds \"ay\"\n\n2. The main `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with each word transformed:\n   - It pre-allocates the result vector to the same length as the input\n   - It uses `Threads.@threads` to launch a separate thread for each iteration of the loop\n   - Inside the loop, it applies `pig_latin` to each word and stores the result in the corresponding index of the result vector\n   - Finally it returns the result vector\n\nSome key points:\n\n- I used abstract types like `AbstractString` and `AbstractVector` to allow flexibility in the specific string and vector types used\n- The `Threads.@threads` macro automatically handles the multi-threading, dividing iterations between available threads\n- Pre-allocating the result vector improves performance by avoiding resizing\n- Using `eachindex` is more efficient and general than `1:length(words)`\n\nYou can call this function on a vector of words to get back the Pig Latin transformed versions, with the work spread across multiple threads for performance.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[346,598],"elapsed":26.317129208,"cost":0.050039999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
