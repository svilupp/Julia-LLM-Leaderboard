[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform` function that takes a single word as input and applies the pig latin transformation rules:\n   - If the word is empty, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first letter of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), \"way\" is appended to the word.\n   - Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\n3. We create a `results` vector to store the transformed words, with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each word in `words`. This allows each iteration to run on a separate thread.\n   - The `for` loop iterates over the indices of `words` using `eachindex(words)`.\n   - For each index `i`, we apply the `transform` function to the corresponding word (`words[i]`) and store the result in `results[i]`.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed pig latin words.\n\nThe function uses the `AbstractString` abstract type to accept any string type (e.g., `String`, `SubString`). It also uses standard Julia functions like `isempty`, `isletter`, and `lowercase` for string manipulation.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop, allowing each iteration to run on a separate thread for improved performance when dealing with a large number of words.\n\nYou can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings, and it will return a new vector with the transformed pig latin words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution leverages Julia's built-in threading capabilities to process the words concurrently, providing efficient pig latin transformation for a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[345,703],"elapsed":31.712626916,"cost":0.05789999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20633,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
