[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We define a helper function `transform_word` that takes a single word as a string and transforms it into Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive) using `occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\"i, word)`. If so, it appends \"way\" to the word. Otherwise, it uses `match` with a regular expression to split the word into consonants and the rest, then rearranges them and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. In the main `pig_latinify` function, we create a vector `pig_latin_words` of the same length as the input `words` vector to store the transformed words. We use `Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))` to create an uninitialized vector of abstract strings.\n\n3. We use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over each word in `words`. This spawns multiple threads to process the words concurrently.\n\n4. Inside the loop, we call `transform_word` on each word and store the result in the corresponding index of `pig_latin_words`.\n\n5. Finally, we return the vector of transformed Pig Latin words.\n\nThe function takes a vector of abstract strings (`Vector{AbstractString}`) as input and returns a vector of abstract strings as output. This allows it to handle any string type, such as `String` or `SubString`.\n\nBy using `Threads.@threads`, the function leverages Julia's multithreading capabilities to process the words concurrently, potentially speeding up the transformation for large vectors of words.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe function transforms each word in the input vector into its Pig Latin equivalent using multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[345,674],"elapsed":30.670697166,"cost":0.055725,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15461,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
