[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform_word` function that takes a single word as input and converts it to pig latin. It follows these rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, it moves all consecutive consonants before the first vowel to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n3. We create a `results` vector to store the transformed words. The vector is preallocated with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the iterations over the `words` vector. Each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n\n5. Inside the `Threads.@threads` loop, we iterate over each index of `words` using `eachindex`. For each word, we call the `transform_word` function to convert it to pig latin and store the result in the corresponding position of the `results` vector.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed words.\n\nThis solution utilizes multiple threads to process each word in parallel, which can provide performance benefits for larger vectors of words.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution uses regular expressions to match and transform the words, and it handles both vowel-starting and consonant-starting words correctly. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to distribute the iterations over multiple threads for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[345,600],"elapsed":27.296431708,"cost":0.050175,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13732,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
