[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new vector of strings transformed into pig latin.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a helper function called `transform_word` that takes a single word as input and returns its pig latin transformation. The logic for pig latin transformation is as follows:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, find the first occurrence of a vowel in the word, move the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word, and append \"ay\".\n\n3. We create a new vector called `results` to store the transformed words. It is initialized with undefined values and has the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word. The `for` loop iterates over the indices of the `words` vector.\n\n5. Inside the threaded loop, we call the `transform_word` function for each word and store the transformed word in the corresponding position of the `results` vector.\n\n6. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed pig latin words.\n\nNote:\n- The function uses the `occursin` and `match` functions from the `Regex` standard library to check for vowels and split the word into consonants and the remaining part.\n- The `Threads.@threads` macro automatically distributes the iterations of the loop across available threads, making the transformation process parallel.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"Uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe solution leverages Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities to parallelize the transformation of each word, potentially improving performance for large vectors of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[346,669],"elapsed":29.793132959,"cost":0.055365,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28126,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
