[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We define an inner function `transform_word` that takes a single word as a string and transforms it to pig latin:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case insensitive), it appends \"way\" to the end. \n   - Otherwise, it moves the leading consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. In the main `pig_latinify` function:\n   - We create an uninitialized output vector `pig_latin_words` to store the pig latin transformed words.\n   - We use `Threads.@threads` to launch a multithreaded loop that iterates over the indices of the input `words` vector.\n   - For each index `i`, it applies `transform_word` to `words[i]` and stores the result in `pig_latin_words[i]`.\n   - Finally, it returns the `pig_latin_words` vector containing the pig latin transformed words.\n\nSome notes:\n\n- The function uses `AbstractString` as the argument type to accept any string type. The return type is concretely `Vector{String}`.\n- `Threads.@threads` automatically handles the distribution of iterations across available threads. The number of threads can be set with `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.\n- The regex `r\"^[aeiou]\"i` checks if the word starts with a vowel (case insensitive). \n- The regex `r\"^([^aeiou]+)(.+)\"` captures the leading consonant cluster and the rest of the word.\n\nThis implements the pig latin transformer in a multithreaded manner in Julia.
