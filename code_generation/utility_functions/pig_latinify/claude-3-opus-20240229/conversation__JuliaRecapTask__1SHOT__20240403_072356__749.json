[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new vector of strings with each word transformed into pig latin.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a nested `transform` function that takes a single word as input and returns its pig latin transformation. \n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), we append \"way\" to the end of the word. \n   - Otherwise, we split the word into two parts: the consonant cluster at the beginning and the rest of the word. We then concatenate the rest of the word, the consonant cluster, and \"ay\".\n\n3. We create a new vector `results` to store the transformed words. The size of `results` is set to the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n4. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each index of the `words` vector in parallel using multiple threads. \n   - For each iteration, we transform the corresponding word using the `transform` function and store the result in the `results` vector at the same index.\n\n5. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed pig latin words.\n\nThis solution leverages Julia's built-in support for multithreading with the `Threads.@threads` macro. Each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread, allowing for parallel processing of the words. The `transform` function is defined inside the `pig_latinify` function to avoid global scope and capture the necessary variables.\n\nNote: Make sure to start Julia with multiple threads using the `-t` option (e.g., `julia -t auto`) to enable multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[345,564],"elapsed":27.567657542,"cost":0.047474999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14489,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
