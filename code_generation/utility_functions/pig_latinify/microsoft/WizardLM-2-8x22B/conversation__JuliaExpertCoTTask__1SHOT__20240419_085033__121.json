The helper function `to_pig_latin` handles the conversion of individual words, and the main function applies this transformation to each word in the input vector, utilizing Julia's threading capabilities to do so in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[195,798],"elapsed":97.677837958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1022928475,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
