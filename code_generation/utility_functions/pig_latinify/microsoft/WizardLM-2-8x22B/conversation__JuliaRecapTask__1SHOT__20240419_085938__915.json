[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Inside the function, create a new vector to store the transformed strings.\n3. Define a helper function `pig_latin_word` that converts a single word to Pig Latin.\n4. Use Julia's `@threads` macro to iterate over the input vector and apply the `pig_latin_word` function to each string in a separate thread.\n5. Return the new vector containing the Pig Latin transformed strings.\n\nHere's the Julia code implementing the above steps:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\n\"\"\"\n    pig_latinify(words)\n\nTransforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin on a per-word basis, using threading for each word.\n\"\"\"\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Preallocate the output vector with the same size as the input\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Define the helper function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin_word(word::String)::String\n        # Check if the first character is a vowel\n        if word[1] in 'aeiouAEIOU'\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the first vowel\n            first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in 'aeiouAEIOU', word)\n            if first_vowel_idx === nothing\n                return word * \"ay\" # No vowel found, just add \"ay\" at the end\n            else\n                # Move the consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\"\n                return word[first_vowel_idx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Iterate over the words and transform each one to Pig Latin using a separate thread\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with each string transformed into Pig Latin. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word across multiple threads, which can be beneficial for performance when dealing with a large number of strings.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function checks if the first character is a vowel and appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the first character is not a vowel, it finds the first vowel, moves all consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\". If no vowel is found, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `pig_latinify` function and prints the resulting Pig Latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[373,792],"elapsed":37.793144417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-591696590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
