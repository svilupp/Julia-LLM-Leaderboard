Each word is processed on a separate thread, and the results are stored in a thread-local manner to avoid race conditions. The helper function `to_pig_latin` handles the conversion of individual words according to the Pig Latin rules.","status":200,"tokens":[195,840],"elapsed":53.929997833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-370854328,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
