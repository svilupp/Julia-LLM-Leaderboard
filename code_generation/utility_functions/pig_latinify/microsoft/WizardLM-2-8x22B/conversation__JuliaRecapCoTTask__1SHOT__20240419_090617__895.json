[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will create a function `pig_latinify` that will transform each string in a vector into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a language game where words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules. The general rule for converting a word to Pig Latin is as follows:\n\n- If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n- If a word begins with a consonant or a consonant cluster (like \"ch\" or \"scr\"), move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\nWe will use Julia's `Threads` module to run each iteration on a separate thread. Here's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Define a helper function `pig_latin_word` that transforms a single word to Pig Latin.\n2. Define the main function `pig_latinify` that uses `Threads.@threads` for parallel execution over the vector of strings.\n3. Ensure that the function handles punctuation and capitalization appropriately.\n\nHere's the Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Helper function to transform a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    consonants = \"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ\"\n    \n    # Find the index of the first vowel\n    first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n    \n    if first_vowel_idx === nothing\n        # No vowels found, treat the whole word as a consonant cluster\n        first_vowel_idx = length(word) + 1\n    end\n    \n    # Move the consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\"\n    if first_vowel_idx > 1\n        return word[first_vowel_idx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n        return word * \"way\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    # Allocate an output vector of the same size as the input\n    output = similar(words)\n    \n    # Use Threads.@threads to parallelize the transformation\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        # Handle punctuation and capitalization\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            output[i] = uppercase(pig_latin_word(lowercase(word)))\n        else\n            output[i] = pig_latin_word(word)\n        end\n        # Ensure punctuation is kept at the end of the word\n        punctuation = r\"[.,!?]\"\n        if occursin(punctuation, word)\n            punct = match(punctuation, word).match\n            output[i] = rstrip(output[i], punct) * punct\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"is\", \"fun!\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)\n```\n\nThis code will transform each word in the input vector `words` into Pig Latin, running each transformation on a separate thread. It also handles punctuation and capitalization by preserving the case of the original word and appending punctuation to the end of the transformed word.\n\nPlease note that the `Threads.@threads` macro automatically handles the creation and management of threads, and the `eachindex` function is used to iterate over the indices of the input vector. The `similar` function is used to preallocate the output vector with the correct size and type.","status":200,"tokens":[375,967],"elapsed":33.697099,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1161583806,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
