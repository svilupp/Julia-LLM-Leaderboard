Then, for each word in the input vector, a new thread is spawned. In that thread, the word is transformed into pig latin and then put into the channel. After all threads have finished, the results are collected from the channel and returned as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[190,280],"elapsed":1.993731834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":59544181,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
