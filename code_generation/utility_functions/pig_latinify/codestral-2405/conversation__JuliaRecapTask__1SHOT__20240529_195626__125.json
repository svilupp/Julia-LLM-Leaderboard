[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function will iterate over each string and convert it to pig latin using threading. Here's the systematic approach I will follow:\n\n1. Define a helper function `pig_latin_word` that takes a string as input and returns the pig latin version of that string. This function will move the first consonant cluster of the word to the end, add \"ay\", and convert the word to lowercase.\n2. Define the main function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n3. Use `Threads.@threads` to create a new thread for each string in the vector and apply the `pig_latin_word` function to convert it to pig latin.\n4. Store the pig latin versions of the strings in a new vector.\n5. Return the vector of pig latin strings.\n\nLet's write the code to implement this solution.\n```python\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)::String\n    lower_word = lowercase(word)\n    if lower_word in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n        return lower_word * \"way\"\n    else\n        consonants = \"\"\n        while !in(lower_word[1], [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"])\n            consonants *= lower_word[1]\n            lower_word = lower_word[2:end]\n        end\n        return lower_word * consonants * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})::Vector{String}\n    return Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[368,471],"elapsed":3.376974375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1731428120,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
