[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It creates a new vector `result` with the same length as `words` and initializes it with `undef` values. This is necessary because Julia requires arrays to have a fixed size when using multithreading.\n\nThe function then iterates over each string in `words` using the `Threads.@threads` macro, which automatically distributes the iterations among the available threads. For each word, it checks whether the first character is a letter. If it is, the function checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant and transforms the word accordingly using standard pig latin rules. If the first character is not a letter, the function leaves the word unchanged. The transformed word is then stored in the `result` vector at the appropriate index.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector, which contains the pig latin versions of all the words in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[370,380],"elapsed":2.755447334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1254509779,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
