[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The transformation rules are: words that start with a vowel have \"way\" appended to the end; words that start with a consonant have the first consonant moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" appended.\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to create a separate thread for each iteration of the loop. This allows the function to take advantage of multiple cores on the machine, which can improve performance for large vectors of strings.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input vector contains only words, and that each word contains at least one non-space character. If these assumptions are not valid, the function may produce incorrect results or throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[370,370],"elapsed":2.741514333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-200033101,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
