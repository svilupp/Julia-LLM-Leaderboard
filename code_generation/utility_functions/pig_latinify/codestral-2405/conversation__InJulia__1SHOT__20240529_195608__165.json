Here's an example of how you could write a `pig_latinify` function in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and changes each string to pig latin using threading.\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadsX\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    num_threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if length(word) > 0 && isletter(word[1])\n            pig_latin_word = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        else\n            pig_latin_word = word\n        end\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and creates a new vector `pig_latin_words` to store the pig latin translated words. It then uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector on a separate thread. The pig latin translation is done by moving the first letter of the word to the end and adding \"ay\". If the word is empty or doesn't start with a letter, it is left as is. Finally, the function returns the vector of pig latin translated words.","status":200,"tokens":[61,333],"elapsed":2.349705291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-358568310,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
