[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's a plan:\n\n1. Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use Julia's threading capabilities to iterate over each string in the vector on a separate thread.\n3. Define a helper function `transform_to_pig_latin` that transforms a single string to pig latin.\n4. Inside `pig_latinify`, create a channel to collect the transformed strings.\n5. Spawn a new thread for each string in the input vector, applying `transform_to_pig_latin` to it and putting the result in the channel.\n6. Wait for all threads to finish.\n7. Collect the results from the channel and return them as a vector.\n\nI'll write the code now.\n```python\nfunction transform_to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if length(word) < 2\n        return word * \"way\"\n    elseif !ismatch(r\"[aeiouAEIOU]\", word[1])\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    results = Channel{String}(length(words))\n    @sync for word in words\n        @async put!(results, transform_to_pig_latin(word))\n    end\n    return collect(results)\nend\n\n# Test the function\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[370,375],"elapsed":2.692950958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2038557896,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
