[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's a simple implementation of a pig latin transformer in Julia using threads. This function will take a vector of strings, create a new thread for each string, convert it to pig latin, and store the results in a new vector.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if length(word) > 0 && isletter(word[1])\n            word = lowercase(word)\n            if startswith(word, ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'))\n                results[i] = word * \"way\"\n            else\n                results[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        else\n            results[i] = word\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the first character of the word is a letter. If it is, it converts the word to lowercase for consistency. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end. If it starts with a consonant, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the word doesn't start with a letter, it leaves the word unchanged.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input vector contains only words and that each word is a single string. It does not handle punctuation or multiple words in a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[370,375],"elapsed":3.066588791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1143872563,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
