[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I will then iterate over each string in the vector and perform the necessary transformations to convert it to pig latin.\n\nHere are the steps to solve this task:\n\n1. Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use a map function to apply the pig latin transformation to each string in the vector, running each iteration on a separate thread using the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n3. Inside the map function, create a helper function to perform the pig latin transformation on a single string.\n4. In the helper function, check if the string starts with a vowel. If it does, append \"way\" to the end of the string.\n5. If the string starts with a consonant, move the first consonant(s) to the end of the string and append \"ay\".\n6. Return the transformed string.\n\nLet's write the code to solve this task.\n```python\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    function pig_latin_transform(word::AbstractString)\n        if word[1] in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        strings[i] = pig_latin_transform(strings[i])\n    end\n\n    return strings\nend\n\n# Test the function\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latin_strings = pig_latinify(strings)\npig_latin_strings\n```","status":200,"tokens":[368,418],"elapsed":2.930051167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1631235794,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
