This function will check if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not. If it's a vowel, it will append \"way\" to the end of the word. If it's a consonant, it will move the consonant to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n\nThen, I would define the `pig_latinify` function that accepts a vector of strings. This function will create a task for each string in the vector and schedule it to run on a separate thread. The results will be collected into a vector and returned.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(\"aeiou\")\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that Julia is running with multiple threads enabled. If Julia is running with a single thread, the `Threads.@threads` macro will have no effect.","status":200,"tokens":[190,395],"elapsed":2.761415375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-269177722,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
