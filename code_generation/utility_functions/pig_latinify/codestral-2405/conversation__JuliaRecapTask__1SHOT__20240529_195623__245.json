[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution that uses Julia's `Threads` module to accomplish threading. This solution assumes that each word in the input vector is a separate string. The function `pig_latinify` transforms each word to pig latin by moving the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and appending \"ay\". The function `pig_latinify_vector` applies `pig_latinify` to each word in the input vector using multiple threads.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that words only contain lowercase or uppercase letters and does not handle punctuation or non-alphabetic characters. It also assumes that the input vector is not empty.","status":200,"tokens":[368,344],"elapsed":2.61954425,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1434959275,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
