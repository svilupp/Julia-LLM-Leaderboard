It creates a vector of the same length as the input vector to store the pig latin words. It then iterates over each string, moving the first character to the end and appending \"ay\". This operation is performed on a separate thread for each string to improve performance.","status":200,"tokens":[102,202],"elapsed":1.447986042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1483385502,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
