This implementation uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n        if length(word) == 0\n            return word\n        elseif word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input. It defines a nested function `pig_latinify_word` that transforms a single word into pig latin. This nested function is then applied to each word in the input vector in parallel using the `Threads.@threads` macro. The transformed words are then stored back into the input vector, which is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[61,303],"elapsed":2.0938735,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1172686388,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
