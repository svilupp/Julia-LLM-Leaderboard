This code assumes that a word in pig latin is formed by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". Note: this code might not show a performance improvement on a single-core machine.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if length(word) > 0\n            words[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and iterates over each string. If the string is not empty, it moves the first character to the end and appends \"ay\".
