[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For each word, it checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If it doesn't, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". The vector version of the function performs the transformation in parallel using Julia's threading capabilities.\n\nTo use the function on a vector of strings, you can simply call it like this:\n\n```Julia\njulia> pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"appleway\"\n \"ananabay\"\n \"errychay\"\n```\n\nThis will return a new vector of strings with the pig latin transformation applied to each word.","status":200,"tokens":[368,384],"elapsed":2.752475541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":292148389,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
