Then it defines another `pig_latinify` function that transforms each string in a vector of strings to pig latin using multiple threads. The `ThreadsX.jl` package is used to create static threads, which means that the number of threads is equal to the number of available CPU cores. The `Threads.@threads :static for i in eachindex(words)` line creates a loop that runs on multiple threads, and the `words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])` line transforms each string in the vector to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[102,307],"elapsed":2.145428292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1938203945,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
