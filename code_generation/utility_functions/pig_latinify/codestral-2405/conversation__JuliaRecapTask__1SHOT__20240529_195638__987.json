[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of strings where each word has been transformed to pig latin.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function is defined to transform a single word to pig latin. It checks if the first character of the word is a letter. If it is, the function moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". If the first character is not a letter, the function returns the word as is.\n\nThe `ThreadsX.map` function is used to apply the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word in the input vector. The `ThreadsX.map` function automatically distributes the work among the available threads, so the transformation of each word is performed in parallel.\n\nFinally, the `pig_latinify` function returns the new vector of pig latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[368,436],"elapsed":3.089448333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":186620820,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
