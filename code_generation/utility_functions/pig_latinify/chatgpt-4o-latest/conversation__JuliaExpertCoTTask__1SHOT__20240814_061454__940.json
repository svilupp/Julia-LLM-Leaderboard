When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Approach\n1. Define the function `pig_latinify` which takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use multithreading to apply the pig latin transformation to each string concurrently.\n3. The basic rules for pig latin:\n   - If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), append \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n   - If a word starts with a consonant, move the first consonant (or the first consonant cluster) to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n4. Return the modified vector of strings.\n\n## Step 2: Write Code\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction is_vowel(c)\n    return c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    if is_vowel(word[1])\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Find the first vowel\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if is_vowel(word[i])\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        return word * \"ay\"  # If no vowel is found (all consonants)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the Task\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check that Your Solution is Correct\nExpected output:\n```plaintext\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nRun the code to confirm it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[170,423],"elapsed":4.607091459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1297569072,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
