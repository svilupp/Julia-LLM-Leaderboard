It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can implement the `pig_latinify` function using Julia's multithreading and string manipulation capabilities. Below is an implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    isvowel(c) = c in \"aeiou\"\n    return isvowel(word[1]) ? word * \"way\" : word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\", \"string\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"exampleway\", \"tringsay\"]\n```\n\nThis implementation leverages multithreading using the `@threads` macro for parallel execution. Each string is converted to its Pig Latin form across different threads.","status":200,"tokens":[95,256],"elapsed":2.991881125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2032229648,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
