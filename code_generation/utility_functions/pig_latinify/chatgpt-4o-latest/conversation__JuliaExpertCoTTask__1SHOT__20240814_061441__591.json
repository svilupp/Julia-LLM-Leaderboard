If the word starts with a vowel, it appends `\"way\"` to the word. If it starts with a consonant, it moves all letters before the first vowel to the end and appends `\"ay\"`.\n  \n- **pig_latinify Function**: Takes a vector of strings and converts each to Pig Latin using multiple threads. `@threads` is used to parallelize the process.\n\n### Example Output:\n```julia\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[170,370],"elapsed":4.24516375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1755653709,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
