It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Problem Breakdown\n1. Convert each word into its corresponding \"pig latin\" version.\n2. Use multi-threading to process each string in the vector on a separate thread.\n3. Return the transformed vector.\n\n### Pig Latin Conversion Rules:\n1. If a word begins with a consonant, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word, then add \"ay\".\n2. If a word begins with a vowel, simply add \"yay\" to the end.\n\n## Step 2: Write the `pig_latinify` Function\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_char = lowercase(word[1])\n    \n    if first_char in vowels\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    else\n        consonant_cluster_length = findfirst(c -> lowercase(c) in vowels, word) - 1\n        if consonant_cluster_length == 0\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[consonant_cluster_length+1:end] * word[1:consonant_cluster_length] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Test the Function\n\n```julia\n# Testing with the given data\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\n\nprintln(result)  # Output should be [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check for Correctness\n- `hello` → `ellohay`\n- `apple` → `appleyay`\n- `strong` → `ongstray`\n- `world` → `orldway`\n\nThe function correctly converts the words into Pig Latin with multi-threaded execution.","status":200,"tokens":[170,458],"elapsed":5.036373083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1065011016,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
