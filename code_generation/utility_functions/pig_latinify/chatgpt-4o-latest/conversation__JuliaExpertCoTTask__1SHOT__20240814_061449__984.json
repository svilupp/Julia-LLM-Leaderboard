If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" at the end. If it starts with a consonant, we move the prefix before the first vowel to the end and then add \"ay\".\n2. **pig_latinify**: This function iterates over the list of words in parallel using `@threads` and applies the transformation on each word.\n\n### Run:\n```julia\n# Example output:\n# [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[170,346],"elapsed":3.629451542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":285985922,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
