[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We will use this to ensure each word's transformation occurs on a separate thread.\n\n3. **Combine the Logic**:\n   - Implement the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings, iterates over each string, and converts it to Pig Latin using the defined logic. Each iteration will use a separate thread.\n\n### Julia Code Implementation\n\n```julia\n# Utility function to check if a character is a vowel\nis_vowel(c::Char) = c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n\n# Function to convert individual words to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    if is_vowel(word[1])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        consonant_cluster_end = findfirst(is_vowel, word)\n        if consonant_cluster_end === nothing\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[consonant_cluster_end:end] * word[1:(consonant_cluster_end - 1)] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Pig latinify function with multi-threading\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`to_pig_latin(word::String)`**: This function converts a single English word to Pig Latin based on the rules mentioned:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\".\n   - If it starts with a consonant, the first vowel identifies the end of the consonant cluster, which is moved to the end, and \"ay\" is added.\n\n2. **`pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}`**: This is the main function:\n   - Input: Accepts a vector of strings.\n   - The iteration over each word uses the `Threads.@threads` macro, which ensures each transformation runs on a separate thread.\n   - `results` stores the transformed words and is then returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"identity\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\n\nprintln(pig_latinified) # Output might look like: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"identityway\"]\n```\n\n### Double-check the Solution:\n- **Edge cases**: Pay attention to words that do not contain any vowels, single-letter words, and capitalized words. The current implementation should handle those cases properly.\n\nThis should meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.","status":200,"tokens":[319,711],"elapsed":7.846243125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-276089411,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
