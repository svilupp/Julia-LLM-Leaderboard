Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using Julia's `Threads` module. Below is an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    \n    if first_letter in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\nlatin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(latin_words)\n```\n\nThis will run the Pig Latin transformation in parallel for each word in the input vector.
