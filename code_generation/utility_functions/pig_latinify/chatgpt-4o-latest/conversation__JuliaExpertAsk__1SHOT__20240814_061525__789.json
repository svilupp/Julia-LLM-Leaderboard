It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's how you can implement `pig_latinify` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_vowel = findfirst(c -> c in \"aeiou\", word)\n    if first_vowel == 1\n        return word * \"way\"\n    elseif first_vowel > 1\n        return word[first_vowel:end] * word[1:first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `@threads` is used to run the loop in parallel.\n2. `to_pig_latin` converts a single word to Pig Latin.\n3. Modify the input vector in-place to reduce overhead.\n\nYou can use it as follows:\n```julia\nwords = [\"thread\", \"example\", \"julialang\", \"awesome\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nThis will produce modified `words` in Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[95,253],"elapsed":3.258506,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1405111665,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
