The resulting Pig Latin translations are then printed.\n\n### Running Julia Code\n\nTo run the Julia code, ensure that your Julia installation has been compiled with multi-threading enabled. You can then run the script with:\n\n```julia\njulia -t <number_of_threads> script.jl\n```\n\nReplace `<number_of_threads>` with the number of threads you want to use for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[62,746],"elapsed":7.566832583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1461552663,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
