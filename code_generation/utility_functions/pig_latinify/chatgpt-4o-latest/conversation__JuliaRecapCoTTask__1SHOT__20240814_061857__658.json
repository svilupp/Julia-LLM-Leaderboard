[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks whether the first character is a vowel or consonant and modifies the word accordingly.\n- **`pig_latinify` function**: This function takes a vector of strings and processes each string on a separate thread using the `@threads` macro. The results are stored in a new vector to avoid race conditions.\n\n### Testing:\nTo ensure the function works, let's test it with a few words:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"is\", \"too\", \"python\", \"ELIXIR\"]\npiglatin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n\n# The output should be something like: \n# [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"appleway\", \"isway\", \"ootay\", \"ythonpay\", \"IXIRElay\"]\nprintln(piglatin_words)\n```\n\n### Double-check:\n- Verify multithreading: By observing the execution and time taken, you will notice that `@threads` speeds up the processing if there are a significant number of words.\n- Confirm all transformations to Pig Latin adhere to the mentioned rules.\n\nThis solution should perform efficiently while ensuring correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[319,835],"elapsed":8.67137325,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1830004147,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
