[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to run each iteration on a separate thread. The function first finds the index of the first vowel in each word, and if no vowel is found, it appends \"ay\" to the word. Otherwise, it moves the part of the word before the first vowel to the end and appends \"ay\". The function uses `findfirst` to locate the first vowel and string concatenation to build the pig latin word.\n\nThe test at the end of the code demonstrates the usage of the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of words. The results are printed using the `println` function.\n\nPlease note that this solution is designed to work with ASCII input strings. For Unicode support, you might want to use a more sophisticated vowel detection algorithm.","status":200,"tokens":[370,508],"elapsed":11.974746875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":254693894,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
