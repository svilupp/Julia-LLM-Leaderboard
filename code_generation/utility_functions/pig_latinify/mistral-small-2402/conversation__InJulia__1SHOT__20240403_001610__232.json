However, it's important to note that Julia's threads are green threads, which means they don't provide true parallelism due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). For true parallelism, you would need to use processes.\n\nHere's a simple pig latin transformer in Julia that operates on a vector of strings. It uses threads but doesn't provide true parallelism due to the GIL.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str)\n    # Find the initial consonants\n    initial_consonants = match(r\"^[^aeiou]+\", str, ignorecase = true)\n\n    if initial_consonants === nothing\n        return str * \"ay\" # No initial consonants, just add \"ay\"\n    end\n\n    # Move the initial consonants to the end and add \"ay\"\n    return string(str[initial_consonants.offset:end], initial_consonants.match, \"ay\")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(vec)\n    n_threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(vec))\n\n    # Iterate over each string and change it to pig latin\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(vec)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(vec[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nTo use true parallelism, you would need to use the `Distributed` module and run this on multiple processes. However, this would require more setup and is beyond the scope of the question.","status":200,"tokens":[61,396],"elapsed":4.330896667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1628880412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
