The regular expressions `consonant_cluster_rx` and `rest_of_word_rx` are used to extract the consonant cluster and the rest of the word from the input word, and then the pig latin word is constructed by concatenating the rest of the word, the consonant cluster, and \"ay\". The resulting array of pig latinified words is then returned.\n\nWhen run with the example input `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`, this function produces the output:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nYou can verify that the output is correct by manually checking that each word has been transformed into pig latin according to the rules.","status":200,"tokens":[190,534],"elapsed":5.867019458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-290198416,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
