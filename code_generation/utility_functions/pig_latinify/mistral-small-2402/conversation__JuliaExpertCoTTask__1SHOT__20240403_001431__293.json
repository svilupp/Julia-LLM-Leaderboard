It then defines the main function `pig_latinify_threaded` that applies this transformation to each word in a vector. The `@threads` macro is used to run each iteration in a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[190,302],"elapsed":3.316976916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":761990936,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
