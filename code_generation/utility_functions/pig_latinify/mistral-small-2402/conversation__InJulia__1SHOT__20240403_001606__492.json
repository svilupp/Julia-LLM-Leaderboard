However, Julia's standard library does not include a built-in Pig Latin transformation function. Here's a custom implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(input)\n        word = input[i]\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c âˆˆ vowels, lowercase(word))\n\n        if first_vowel_index === nothing\n            # If the word contains no vowels, append \"ay\" to the end\n            output[i] = string(word, \"ay\")\n        elseif first_vowel_index == 1\n            # If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end\n            output[i] = string(word, \"way\")\n        else\n            # Move the initial consonants to the end and append \"ay\"\n            output[i] = string(word[first_vowel_index:end], word[1:first_vowel_index-1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ninput = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\", \"latin\", \"julia\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(input)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis script defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as an input and returns a vector of Pig Latin strings. The function uses the Threads.@threads macro to iterate through the input vector and apply the Pig Latin transformation to each string on a separate thread.\n\nThe Pig Latin transformation involves identifying the first vowel in a word, moving the initial consonants to the end of the word, and appending \"ay\" to the end. The script handles cases where a word contains no vowels or starts with a vowel accordingly.\n\nYou can replace the example input with your own strings to test the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[61,547],"elapsed":6.055791375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-595411392,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
