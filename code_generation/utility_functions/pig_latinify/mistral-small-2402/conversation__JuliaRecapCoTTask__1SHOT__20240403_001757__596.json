[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, I can certainly help you write a Julia program that fulfills your requirements. Here's a basic implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::Vector{String}\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        word = strings[i]\n        if isvowel(first(word))\n            result[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            firstconsonant = first(word)\n            rest = word[2:end]\n            result[i] = rest * firstconsonant * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction isvowel(c::Char)::Bool\n    c = lowercase(c)\n    return c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector of strings where each string has been transformed into pig latin. It uses Julia's `Threads` module to iterate over the vector in parallel, which can improve performance on multi-core systems.\n\nThe `isvowel` function is a helper function that checks if a character is a vowel. It's case-insensitive, so it converts the character to lowercase before checking.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that all words are lowercase and consist only of letters. If you need to handle punctuation, numbers, or capital letters, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that while this code uses multiple threads, the actual performance gain will depend on your specific system and the size of the input data. For small inputs, the overhead of creating and managing threads might outweigh the benefits of parallelism.\n\nFinally, remember to call `using Threads` at the beginning of your script to enable threading functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[370,479],"elapsed":10.574823458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1696898687,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
