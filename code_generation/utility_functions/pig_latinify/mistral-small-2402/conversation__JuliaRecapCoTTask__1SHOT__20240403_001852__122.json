[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses multiple threads to process each string in parallel.\n\nThe pig latin transformation is done by finding the index of the first vowel in the string and then moving all characters before the first vowel to the end of the string and appending \"ay\". If the string starts with a vowel, the \"ay\" is just appended to the end.\n\nThe function uses the `Threads` module from the Julia standard library to create multiple threads. It uses a `Vector` of `AbstractString` to store the pig latin strings. The `@threads` macro is used to run the loop over the strings in parallel.\n\nThe function first creates a vector of the same size as the input vector to store the pig latin strings. It then uses a for loop to process each string. If a string is empty, an empty string is stored in the output vector. Otherwise, the function finds the index of the first vowel and applies the pig latin transformation. The function uses the `findfirst` function from the Julia standard library to find the first vowel. The function uses the `string` function to concatenate strings.\n\nThe function uses the `isequal` function to check for equality between characters, which is more efficient than using the `==` operator. It uses the `∩` operator to find the intersection of two sets of characters, which is more efficient than using the `in` operator in a loop. The function uses the `.|` operator to create a set of uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n\nThe function uses the `if` statement to handle strings that do not contain a vowel. It uses the `===` operator to check if the result of `findfirst` is `nothing`.\n\nThe function uses the `string` function to concatenate strings. It uses the `end` keyword to get the last index of a string. It uses the `1:end-1` syntax to get all indices except the last index. It uses the `first_vowel_index:end` syntax to get all indices from the first vowel index to the end of the string. It uses the `1:first_vowel_index-1` syntax to get all indices before the first vowel index. The function uses the `$` operator for string interpolation to print the results.\n\nThe solution uses general type annotations like `AbstractString` to make the function more versatile. It emphasizes performance by using efficient functions from the Julia standard library. It uses multiple dispatch by using the `string` function with different types of arguments. It avoids new packages unless explicitly requested. It distinguishes itself from Python by using 1-based indexing and multiple dispatch.","status":200,"tokens":[370,1030],"elapsed":11.468231042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1143796344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
