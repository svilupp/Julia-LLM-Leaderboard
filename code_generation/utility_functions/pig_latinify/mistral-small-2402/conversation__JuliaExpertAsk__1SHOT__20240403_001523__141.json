However, I can provide you with a Julia code snippet that uses the `Threads` module for parallel processing. Here's an example of how you might implement a `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    # Check if the first character is a vowel\n    if any(x -> x == lowercase(x), first(str))\n        return str * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Find the first vowel\n        pos = findfirst(x -> x == lowercase(x), str)\n        return str[pos:end] * str[1:pos-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{AbstractString})\n    nthreads = Threads.nthreads()\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strs))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strs)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(strs[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two `pig_latinify` functions. The first one takes a single string and converts it to pig latin. The second one takes a vector of strings and uses threads to convert each string in parallel. The number of threads used is determined by the `Threads.nthreads()` function, which returns the number of threads available to the current process.","status":200,"tokens":[102,358],"elapsed":3.903703875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1340309233,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
