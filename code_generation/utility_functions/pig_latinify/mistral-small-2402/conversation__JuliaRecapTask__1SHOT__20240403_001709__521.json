[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses Julia's built-in `Threads` module to parallelize the transformation over each string in the input vector.\n\nThe transformation itself is done by finding the index of the first vowel in each string, and then moving all characters up to (but not including) the first vowel to the end of the string, followed by the string \"ay\". If the first character of the string is a vowel, then no characters are moved to the end.\n\nThe function uses the `findfirst` function to find the index of the first vowel in each string, and the `isequal` function to test whether a character is equal to the first letter of the alphabet. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the input vector.\n\nThe function is tested by calling it with an array of strings and printing the result.","status":200,"tokens":[368,463],"elapsed":5.121602333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":900063802,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
