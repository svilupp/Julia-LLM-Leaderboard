However, Julia does not have a built-in library for Pig Latin transformation. Here's a simple implementation of a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin using multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(sentence_vector)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(sentence_vector))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(sentence_vector)\n        word = sentence_vector[i]\n        first_char = lowercase(first(word))\n        if first_char ∈ vowels\n            result[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c ∈ vowels, word[2:end])\n            if vowel_index !== nothing\n                result[i] = word[vowel_index:end] * word[1:vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n            else\n                result[i] = word * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nvowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n# Example usage:\nsentences = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\npig_latin_sentences = pig_latinify(sentences)\nprintln(pig_latin_sentences)\n```\n\nThis example defines `pig_latinify` to take a vector of strings as an input, transform each string into Pig Latin, and return a new vector of Pig Latin strings. It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to create separate threads for each iteration of the loop. The `findfirst` function is used to locate the first vowel in the word, and the vowels array contains the lowercase vowels.","status":200,"tokens":[61,464],"elapsed":5.041169042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":513279275,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
