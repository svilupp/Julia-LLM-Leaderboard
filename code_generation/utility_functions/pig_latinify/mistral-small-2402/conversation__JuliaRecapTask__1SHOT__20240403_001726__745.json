[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function locates the first vowel in each word, then moves the part of the word from the first vowel to the end to the beginning of the new word, followed by \"ay\". If no vowel is found, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nNote: The `Threads` module is part of the Julia standard library, so no additional packages are needed.\n\nAlso, this solution uses `AbstractVector` and `AbstractString` to allow for different types of collections and strings, respectively, not just the most common ones (Array and String).","status":200,"tokens":[368,413],"elapsed":4.511037167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1998045150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
