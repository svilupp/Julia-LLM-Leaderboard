It iterates over each string in a separate thread and transforms it into pig latin. The transformed strings are stored in the `pig_latin_strings` vector. The function then returns the `pig_latin_strings` vector.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function checks if the first letter of the string is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"-way\" to the end of the string. If it's not, it finds the index of the first vowel, moves the part of the string after the first vowel to the start, moves the part of the string before the first vowel to the end, and appends \"-ay\" to it.\n\nThe code at the end defines a vector of strings and calls the `pig_latinify` function with this vector as input. The result of the function is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[190,552],"elapsed":5.973795,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1433164203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
