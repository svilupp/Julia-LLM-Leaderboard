[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

Here's the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        original_string = strings[i]\n        words = split(original_string)\n        pig_latin_words = String[]\n        for word in words\n            if length(word) > 1\n                first_letter = word[1]\n                rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n                pig_latin_word = rest_of_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n            else\n                pig_latin_word = word * \"ay\"\n            end\n            push!(pig_latin_words, pig_latin_word)\n        end\n        results[i] = join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings, creates a new vector to store the results, and then iterates over each string using a separate thread. For each string, it splits it into words, transforms each word to pig latin, and then joins the transformed words back into a single string. The transformed strings are stored in the `results` vector, which is returned at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[346,319],"elapsed":18.927170833,"cost":0.00013776,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2125149973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
