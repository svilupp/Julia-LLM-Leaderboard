It uses a helper function `to_pig_latin` to convert a single string to pig latin. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop that iterates over each string in the input vector. The transformed strings are stored in a new vector, which is returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[181,288],"elapsed":17.325089958,"cost":0.00010598,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":527198195,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
