It defines a nested `transform_word` function that converts a single word to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and appending \"ay\". The `pig_latinify` function then creates a new vector to store the transformed words and uses a `Threads.@threads` macro to create a separate thread for each word transformation. The transformed words are stored in the `transformed_words` vector, which is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[181,310],"elapsed":19.190093875,"cost":0.00011214000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-180313788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
