This function assumes that the input vector contains only lowercase English words.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function transform_word(word)\n        if length(word) > 1\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n            return string(rest_of_word, first_letter, \"ay\")\n        else\n            return word\n        end\n    end\n\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = transform_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"multithreading\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified)\n```\n\nThis code creates a function `transform_word` that takes a single word and transforms it into Pig Latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and appending \"ay\". The `pig_latinify` function then uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector in parallel, applying the `transform_word` function to each word. The results are stored in a new vector, which is returned at the end.\n\nPlease note that Julia's multithreading is cooperative, meaning that not all systems will see a performance benefit from using multiple threads for such a small task. The overhead of creating and managing threads might outweigh the benefits for small vectors of strings. However, for larger inputs, this approach can be more efficient.","status":200,"tokens":[59,396],"elapsed":24.775144667,"cost":0.00011914000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-891813680,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
