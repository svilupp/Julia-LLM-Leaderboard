The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop, creating a separate thread for each iteration. The pig latin transformation rules are applied within the loop, and the results are stored in the `results` vector.","status":200,"tokens":[98,378],"elapsed":22.910660958,"cost":0.00011956,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":545857232,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
