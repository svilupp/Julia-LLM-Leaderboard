Below is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Helper function that converts a single word to Pig Latin\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])\n        if !isempty(word) && word[1] in vowels\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # Find the position of the first vowel\n            first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word) \n            if first_vowel_idx === nothing\n                return word # No vowels, return word as is\n            else\n                return word[first_vowel_idx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Prepare an output vector of the same length as the input\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Use @threads to parallelize the loop\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"programming\", \"in\", \"julia\", \"is\", \"fun\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(input_words)\nprintln(pig_latinified)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **`to_pig_latin` Function**: Converts a single word to Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, appending \"way\" if it does. Otherwise, it moves all consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n- **Parallel Processing**: `@threads` is used to process each word in a separate thread, taking advantage of Julia's native multithreading capability.\n- **Output Vector**: An output vector `pig_latin_words` is initialized to store the Pig Latin transformed words.\n\nRemember to run this program in a Julia environment where multithreading is properly configured, typically by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. For example, you can start Julia with multiple threads by running `julia -t 4` in your terminal.","status":200,"tokens":[62,541],"elapsed":4.957680917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1380151402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
