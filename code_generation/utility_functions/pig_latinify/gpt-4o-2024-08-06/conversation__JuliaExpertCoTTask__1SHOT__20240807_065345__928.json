Define a function `pig_latinify_word` to convert a single word to Pig Latin.\n2. Use multithreading to apply `pig_latinify_word` to each word in the input vector of strings.\n3. Ensure that each transformation runs in a separate thread.\n4. Return the transformed list of words.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\n# Function to convert a word to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if first_char in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Find first vowel\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if c in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # If no vowel is found (rare case), return the word as is followed by \"ay\"\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n\n# Function to transform a vector of strings to pig latin using separate threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        results[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\ntransformed = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(transformed)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `pig_latinify_word` checks if the first character is a vowel. If it is, it adds \"way\" at the end. If not, it moves the initial consonant cluster to the end and adds \"ay\".\n- The `pig_latinify` function uses multi-threading (`@threads`) to apply the transformation to each word concurrently.\n- We initialize a results array to store transformed words and iterate over the input, converting each word using a new thread.","status":200,"tokens":[170,469],"elapsed":6.700420083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-134478090,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
