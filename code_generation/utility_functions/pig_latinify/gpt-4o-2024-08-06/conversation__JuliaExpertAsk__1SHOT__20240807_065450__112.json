Here's how you can implement the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinate(word::String)\n    isvowel(c) = c in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    first_vowel_index = findfirst(isvowel, collect(word))\n    \n    if first_vowel_index == 1\n        return word * \"yay\"\n    elseif first_vowel_index !== nothing\n        return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word * \"ay\"  # Handle words without vowels\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinate(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"jump\", \"apple\"]\ntransformed = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `pig_latinate` is a helper function that converts a single word to Pig Latin. It checks for the position of the first vowel and applies the Pig Latin rules.\n- `pig_latinify` applies `pig_latinate` to each string in the vector using `@threads` to parallelize the operations.\n- The `@threads` macro distributes iterations of the loop across available threads, allowing for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[95,349],"elapsed":3.303533792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":584979417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
