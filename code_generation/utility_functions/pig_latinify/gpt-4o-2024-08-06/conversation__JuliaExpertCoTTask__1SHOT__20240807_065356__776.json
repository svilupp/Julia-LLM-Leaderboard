Define the rules for converting words to Pig Latin:\n   - If a word begins with a consonant, move that consonant to the end and add \"ay\".\n   - If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. Implement a function `to_pig_latin` that applies these rules to a single word.\n3. Implement the `pig_latinify` function to iterate over the vector of strings, processing each word in a separate thread.\n4. Combine all results and return the transformed vector.\n\nLet's write the code for this:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\n# Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n    # Check if the first letter is a vowel\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Find index of the first vowel\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if c in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        # If no vowels are found, just return the original word + \"ay\"\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Function to convert an array of strings to Pig Latin using multiple threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Test the function with provided data\ndata = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(data))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `to_pig_latin` function converts a word into Pig Latin based on the rules specified.\n- The `pig_latinify` function uses the `@threads` macro to process each word concurrently, then stores the resulting Pig Latin words in a `results` array.\n- Finally, the transformed words list is returned and printed out. The expected transformation for the provided data should be `[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[170,500],"elapsed":4.923151417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1762326417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
