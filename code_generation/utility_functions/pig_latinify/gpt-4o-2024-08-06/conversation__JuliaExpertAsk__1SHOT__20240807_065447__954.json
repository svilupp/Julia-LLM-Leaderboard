It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create a Pig Latin transformer that operates on a vector of strings and processes each string on a separate thread, you can use the `Threads.@threads` macro in Julia for multi-threading. Here's a sample implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin_word(word::String)::String\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        \n        first_char = first(word)\n        \n        if first_char in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n            return word * \"yay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\", \"translate\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"exampleyay\", \"ranslatetay\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `pig_latin_word` function converts a given word to Pig Latin. If a word starts with a vowel, it appends \"yay\". Otherwise, it moves the first consonant to the end and appends \"ay\".\n- The `@threads` macro distributes the loop iterations across available threads, processing each string concurrently.\n- The results are collected in a vector, `results`, which is returned at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[95,352],"elapsed":3.250219958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1871668386,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
