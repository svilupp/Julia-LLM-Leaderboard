Below is a concise implementation of the `pig_latinify` function using the `Threads.@threads` macro for parallel processing:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if startswith(word, vowels)\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        consonant_cluster_end = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if consonant_cluster_end === nothing\n            return word # No vowels in the word; return word as is\n        else\n            return word[consonant_cluster_end:end] * word[1:consonant_cluster_end-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\", \"input\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"exampleay\", \"inputay\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`to_pig_latin`:** Converts a single word to pig latin by moving the initial consonant cluster to the end and appending \"ay\", or appending \"ay\" directly if it starts with a vowel.\n- **`pig_latinify`:** Uses `@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. The results are collected in the `results` vector.\n- **Concurrency:** Each transformation is done in a separate thread, leveraging multiple CPU cores for improved performance on larger datasets.\n\nRemember to set the number of threads with the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable when running your script for multithreading to take effect.","status":200,"tokens":[95,434],"elapsed":5.2336095,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1680612567,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
