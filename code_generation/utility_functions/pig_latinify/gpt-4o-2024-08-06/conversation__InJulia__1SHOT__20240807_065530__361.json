Each string will be transformed into Pig Latin in a separate thread. Hereâ€™s how you can construct the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\n# Define a function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    # Basic rule: move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\"\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", word, ignorecase=true)\n        return string(word, \"yay\")  # Handle words beginning with a vowel\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Define the pig latinify function to process a vector of strings\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n\n    # Convert each word to Pig Latin using multiple threads\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"tree\", \"sky\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`to_pig_latin` Function**:\n    - Converts a single word to Pig Latin.\n    - Checks if the word starts with a vowel (optionally handling cases where `y` is treated differently).\n    - For words that begin with a consonant, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n    - For words that begin with a vowel, appends \"yay\".\n\n2. **`pig_latinify` Function**:\n    - Creates a result vector of strings to store the transformed words.\n    - Uses the `@threads` macro from `Base.Threads` to parallelize the iteration over the vector of words, transforming each word using the `to_pig_latin` function.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n    - The `@threads` macro allows each iteration of the loop to run on a separate thread, improving performance when dealing with large vectors on systems with multiple cores.\n\nPlease ensure you run this in a multithreaded Julia session. To enable multithreading, start Julia with `-t N` where `N` is the number of threads you want to use, e.g., `julia -t 4` for four threads.","status":200,"tokens":[62,556],"elapsed":6.859192042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":758174346,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
