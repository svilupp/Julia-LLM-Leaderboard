This enables you to apply transformations concurrently, which can be beneficial for performance, especially on larger datasets.\n\nHere's a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin, each running on a separate thread:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        if !isempty(word) && word[1] in vowels\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            for i in 1:length(word)\n                if word[i] in vowels\n                    return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        return word # Return original if no vowels are found\n    end\n\n    # Result container\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Apply transformation with multithreading\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\ninput_words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(input_words)\nprintln(transformed_words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`to_pig_latin` function**: This helper function applies the Pig Latin rules:\n   - If a word starts with a vowel, append \"way\".\n   - If it starts with a consonant, move all leading consonants to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n   - If there are no vowels, the word stays unchanged (this is just for safety).\n\n2. **Multithreading with `@threads`**:\n   - The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over `words`. Each iteration of this loop may run on a separate thread, depending on the available resources and the number of threads in use.\n\n3. **`result` array**:\n   - Preallocate a results array `result` to store the Pig Latin transformed words. This ensures we maintain the order of the original input.\n\n4. **Example usage**:\n   - Call `pig_latinify` with a vector of words, and it will return a new vector with each word transformed to Pig Latin.\n\nMake sure to set the number of threads in Julia using the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by running Julia with the `-t` flag to utilize multithreading effectively:\n\n```\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\nor run Julia with `-t` option like:\n```\njulia -t 4\n```\n\nThis will enable the use of up to 4 threads, or adjust the number based on your CPU capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[62,649],"elapsed":5.729789583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-459962034,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
