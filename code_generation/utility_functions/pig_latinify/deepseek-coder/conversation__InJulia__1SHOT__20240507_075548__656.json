Here's how you can implement a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if isempty(word)\n            pig_latin_words[i] = word\n        else\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            if first_letter in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')\n                pig_latin_words[i] = word * \"way\"\n            else\n                pig_latin_words[i] = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new vector `pig_latin_words` to store the Pig Latin versions of the words. It then iterates over each word in the input vector, and for each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or not. If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If it's not, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro automatically distributes the iterations of the loop across the available threads in the Julia runtime. This allows the function to run in parallel, which can significantly speed up the transformation of a large number of words.","status":200,"tokens":[67,396],"elapsed":15.708930208,"cost":0.00012026,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1335072253,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
