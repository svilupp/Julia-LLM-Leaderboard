[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop, so each iteration of the loop is run on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note that Julia's threading model is cooperative, which means that the language runtime will not automatically parallelize operations that are not thread-safe. This is why we are using a `Vector` of `String`s as the result, which is a thread-safe data structure.\n\nAlso, please note that Julia's threading model is not suitable for CPU-bound tasks, as it will not provide any performance benefits. For CPU-bound tasks, you should use Julia's distributed computing capabilities or other languages that support true parallelism, such as Python's multiprocessing module.","status":200,"tokens":[396,368],"elapsed":13.14186625,"cost":0.00015848000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":262561435,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
