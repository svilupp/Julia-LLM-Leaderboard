The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, and for each string, it applies the `pig_latin` function which transforms the string to pig latin.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if word == \"\"\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    if word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module to parallelize the loop. Each iteration of the loop is run on a separate thread. The `pig_latin` function is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformation. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the first letter is not a vowel, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[108,350],"elapsed":13.319937958,"cost":0.00011312000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1124616943,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
