[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, and for each string, it applies the `pig_latin` function. The `pig_latin` function transforms a single word into pig latin.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    result = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input vector of strings is not too large to fit into memory. If the input is too large, you might want to consider using a different approach, such as streaming the input from disk or using a database.","status":200,"tokens":[394,267],"elapsed":15.372004625,"cost":0.00012992,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1632638069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
