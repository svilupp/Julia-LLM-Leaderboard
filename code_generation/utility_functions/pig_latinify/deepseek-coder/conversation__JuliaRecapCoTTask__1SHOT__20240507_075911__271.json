[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is done in parallel using threads.\n\nPlease note that Julia's threading model is cooperative, which means that the language runtime will switch between threads at certain points to allow other threads to run. This can lead to performance improvements for CPU-bound tasks, but can also lead to less predictable behavior for tasks that are I/O-bound or need to synchronize with each other.\n\nAlso, Julia's threading model is not suitable for all tasks, and in some cases, using a different approach like parallel computing with processes or distributed computing might be more appropriate.","status":200,"tokens":[396,296],"elapsed":10.240302125,"cost":0.00013832000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2010067105,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
