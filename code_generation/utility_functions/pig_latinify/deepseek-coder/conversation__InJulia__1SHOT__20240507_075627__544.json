Here's how you can implement a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if word[1] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            result[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new vector `result` to store the pig latin versions of the words. It then uses `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over the words. Each thread takes care of one word at a time.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function assumes that all words are lowercase and that they do not contain punctuation. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to add additional logic to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[67,275],"elapsed":9.601931791,"cost":8.638e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":501390789,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
