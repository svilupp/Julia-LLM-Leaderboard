[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, and for each string, it applies the `pig_latin` function which transforms the string into pig latin.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if length(word) == 0\n        return word\n    end\n\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the input vector of strings is not empty. If it can be empty, you should add a check for that.\n\nPlease note that Julia's threading model is cooperative, which means that the language runtime will switch between threads when it is safe to do so. This can lead to different results on different runs, especially when the workload is not evenly distributed among threads. For more complex scenarios, you might want to use Julia's distributed computing capabilities, which are based on message passing and are more suitable for CPU-intensive tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[394,356],"elapsed":14.814412667,"cost":0.00015484,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":786167829,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
