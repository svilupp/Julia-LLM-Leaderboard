[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, and for each string, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or a consonant. If it's a vowel, it simply adds \"way\" to the end of the word. If it's a consonant, it moves all the consonants that appear before the first vowel to the end of the word, then adds \"ay\".\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if word == \"\"\n            transformed_words[i] = word\n            continue\n        end\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        if first_letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            transformed_words[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            for j in 2:length(word)\n                if word[j] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                    transformed_words[i] = word[j:end] * word[1:j-1] * \"ay\"\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses Julia's threading capabilities to process each word in the input vector in parallel. The `@threads` macro automatically distributes the loop iterations across the available threads.\n\nPlease note that Julia's threading model is cooperative, which means that the language runtime will not automatically switch threads in the middle of a computation. This is why we don't need to worry about synchronization issues in this case.","status":200,"tokens":[394,419],"elapsed":18.31176125,"cost":0.00017248,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1098026270,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
