[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This solution uses the `Threads` module to create separate threads for each string transformation.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify_word(strings[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    if length(word) == 0\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of strings where each string is transformed to pig latin. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to create a separate thread for each string transformation.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function is a helper function that takes a single word as input and returns the pig latin version of the word. If the word starts with a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[394,342],"elapsed":14.931819541,"cost":0.00015092,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1917018679,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
