[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I will use Julia's built-in `Threads` module to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Import the `Threads` module.\n2. Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input.\n3. Inside the function, create an empty vector to store the transformed strings.\n4. Use a `for` loop to iterate over each string in the input vector.\n5. Inside the loop, create a new thread for each iteration using the `Threads.@spawn` macro.\n6. In each thread, transform the string into pig latin and store the result in the output vector.\n7. After the loop, use the `Threads.join` function to wait for all threads to finish.\n8. Return the output vector.\n\nHere's the code:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        word = strings[i]\n        if islowercase(word[1])\n            output[i] = word[2:end] * lowercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n        else\n            output[i] = word[2:end] * uppercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\nI will now double-check that the solution is correct by testing it with some sample inputs.\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"language\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[377,422],"elapsed":9.035225208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-976137955,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
