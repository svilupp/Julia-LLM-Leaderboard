[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function operates on a vector of strings and transforms each string to pig latin using a separate thread for each iteration.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if islowercase(word[1])\n            pig_latin_words[i] = lowercase(word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\")\n        else\n            pig_latin_words[i] = uppercase(word[1]) * lowercase(word[2:end] * \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module to create a separate thread for each iteration. The function checks if the first character of the word is lowercase or uppercase and transforms the word to pig latin accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input vector contains only words and does not handle punctuation or other non-alphabetic characters. If you need to handle such cases, you may need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nAlso, please note that the number of threads used by the `@threads` macro is determined by the value of the `Threads.nthreads()` function, which returns the number of threads available to the Julia process. If you want to use a specific number of threads, you can set the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before starting Julia.\n\nFor example, to use 4 threads, you can start Julia with the following command:\n\n```bash\nJULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 julia\n```\n\nThen, you can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of words:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"language\"]\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"hello\"\n \"world\"\n \"Julia\"\n \"language\"\n\njulia> pig_latinify(words)\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"orldway\"\n \"Juliaay\"\n \"anguageay\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[379,572],"elapsed":29.243022459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1679188361,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
