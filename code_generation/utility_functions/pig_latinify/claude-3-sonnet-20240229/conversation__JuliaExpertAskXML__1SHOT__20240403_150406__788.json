The function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It initializes an output vector `results` with the same length as `words` but filled with `undef` values.\n3. It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over the `eachindex` of `words`.\n4. Inside the loop, it processes each `word` string:\n    - If the first character is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n    - If the first character is a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst(isvowel, word)`.\n    - If there are no vowels, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n    - If there are vowels, it splits the word into the consonant cluster and the rest, moves the consonant cluster to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n5. The transformed word is stored in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n6. Finally, the function returns the `results` vector containing the Pig Latin transformed words.\n\nThe helper function `isvowel` checks if a character is a vowel or not.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings contain only lowercase letters. You may need to modify it if you want to handle uppercase letters or other characters.","status":200,"tokens":[100,576],"elapsed":11.150438166,"cost":0.00894,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24912,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
