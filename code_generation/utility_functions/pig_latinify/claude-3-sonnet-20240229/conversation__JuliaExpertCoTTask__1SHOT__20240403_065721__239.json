The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It creates a vector `results` to store the Pig Latin versions of the input words.\n3. It iterates over each word in the input vector using `eachindex`.\n4. For each word, it spawns a new task (thread) using `@spawn` to execute the `pig_latin` function on that word.\n5. The `pig_latin` function returns the Pig Latin version of the input word, which is stored in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n6. The `@sync` block ensures that all the spawned tasks complete before returning the `results` vector.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function follows these rules:\n\n- If the word starts with a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end of the word.\n- If the word starts with consonants, it moves the consonant cluster to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input words are all lowercase. You may need to modify the `pig_latin` function to handle uppercase letters and other edge cases as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[174,552],"elapsed":12.063861208,"cost":0.008802,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24878,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
