It uses `Threads.@threads` to run each transformation on a separate thread.\n\n2. `to_pig_latin` takes a single word and transforms it to pig latin following the rules:\n    - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n    - If the word starts with consonants, move them to the end and add \"ay\"\n    - If the word has no vowels, add \"ay\" to the end\n\nThe example usage shows how to call `pig_latinify` on a sample vector of words.","status":200,"tokens":[208,447],"elapsed":8.154471416,"cost":0.0073290000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16218,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
