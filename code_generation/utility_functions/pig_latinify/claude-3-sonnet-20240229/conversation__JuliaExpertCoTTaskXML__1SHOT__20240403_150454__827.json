Then it uses `Threads.@threads` to spawn a new thread for each word and transform it using the `pig_latin` helper function in parallel.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word string and transforms it to pig latin based on whether the first character is a vowel or not. If a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end, else it moves the leading consonants to the end and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[208,417],"elapsed":8.980562666,"cost":0.006879,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29984,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
