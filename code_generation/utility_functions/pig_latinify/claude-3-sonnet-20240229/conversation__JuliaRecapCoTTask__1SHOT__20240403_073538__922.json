[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It creates an empty vector `pig_latin_words` of the same length as the input vector to store the transformed words.\n3. It uses the `@sync` and `@spawn` macros to create a new task (thread) for each word in the input vector.\n4. Each task calls the `convert_to_pig_latin` function with the corresponding word from the input vector and assigns the transformed word to the corresponding index in the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n5. The `@sync` macro ensures that the `pig_latinify` function waits for all tasks to complete before returning the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n6. The `convert_to_pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and applies the pig latin transformation rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with one or more consonants, it moves the consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n7. The `println.(pig_latin_words)` line prints each transformed word in the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n\nThe main advantage of this implementation is that it processes each word on a separate thread, potentially speeding up the transformation process on multi-core systems.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that you have a reasonably modern version of Julia (1.3 or later) that supports the `Threads` module and the `@spawn` macro for creating tasks (threads). If you're using an older version of Julia, you may need to use a different approach for parallelization, such as Julia's `Distributed` module or external libraries like `Dagger.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[346,741],"elapsed":14.920591334,"cost":0.012153,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":12693,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
