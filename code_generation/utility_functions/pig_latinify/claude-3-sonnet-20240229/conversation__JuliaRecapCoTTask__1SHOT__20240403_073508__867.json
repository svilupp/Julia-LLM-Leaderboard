[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a `Vector{String}` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `result` of the same length as the input vector.\n3. The `transform` function is defined inside `pig_latinify`. It takes an index `i` and transforms the corresponding word in the input vector to its pig latin form, storing the result in `result[i]`.\n4. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to spawn a separate thread for each word in the input vector, executing the `transform` function with the corresponding index.\n5. After all threads have completed, the `result` vector containing the pig latin transformed words is returned.\n\nThe `transform` function checks if the first character of the word is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first consonant to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input vector contains only strings. If you need to handle other types, you may need to add additional checks or type constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[346,477],"elapsed":9.271532208,"cost":0.008193,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-521,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
