It does this by launching a new thread for each string using `Threads.@threads` and calling the `pig_latin` function on each string in parallel.\n\n2. `pig_latin(word)` takes a single string `word` as input and returns its Pig Latin equivalent. It first checks if the first letter is a vowel, in which case it simply appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the first letter is a consonant, it finds the longest initial consonant cluster using a regular expression, moves that cluster to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\".\n\nTo use these functions, simply call `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\noriginal_strings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"computer\", \"science\"]\npig_latin_strings = pig_latinify(original_strings)\nprintln.(pig_latin_strings)\n```\n\nThis will output the Pig Latin equivalents of the input strings, with each string processed in parallel on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[95,492],"elapsed":9.33441475,"cost":0.007665,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27006,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
