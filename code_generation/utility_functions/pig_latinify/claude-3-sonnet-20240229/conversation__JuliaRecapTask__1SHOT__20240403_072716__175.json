[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It creates a vector `results` to store the transformed Pig Latin words, initialized with `undef` (undefined) values.\n3. It uses the `@threads` macro to create a new thread for each iteration of the `eachindex(words)` loop.\n4. Inside the loop, it calls the `pig_latin` function to transform each word and stores the result in the `results` vector.\n5. Finally, it returns the `results` vector containing the transformed Pig Latin words.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation rules:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant cluster, move the consonants to the end and append \"ay\".\n3. If the word contains no vowels, append \"ay\" to the end.\n\nThe `isvowel` helper function checks if a character is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"julia\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nellohay\norldway\nythonpay\nuliajay\n```\n\nNote: This solution uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module, which allows for parallel execution of the loop iterations. However, be aware that creating too many threads can lead to performance issues due to overhead and resource contention. Additionally, the `@threads` macro can have limitations when dealing with certain types of operations or data structures. If you encounter any issues or need more advanced parallelism, you may want to consider using other parallelism approaches, such as `Dagger.jl` or `DistributedArrays.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[345,766],"elapsed":15.527095792,"cost":0.012525,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15275,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
