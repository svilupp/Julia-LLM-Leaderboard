The function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It uses `Future.map` to apply the transformation to each string in a separate thread.\n3. For each string, it checks if the first character is a vowel or not.\n4. If the first character is a vowel, it simply appends \"way\" to the string.\n5. If the first character is a consonant, it moves all the consecutive consonants to the end of the string and then appends \"ay\".\n6. The transformed strings are collected into a vector and returned.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ninput_strings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"programmer\"]\npig_latin_strings = pig_latinify(input_strings)\nprintln(pig_latin_strings)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"appleyay\", \"ogrammerPray\"]\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings contain only lowercase letters. You can modify the code to handle uppercase letters, punctuation, and other scenarios as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[100,451],"elapsed":7.924666917,"cost":0.007065,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15314,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
