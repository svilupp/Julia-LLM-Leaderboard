Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we initialize a new vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n2. We use the `@threads` macro to run the loop in parallel, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n3. Inside the loop, we get the current word from `words[i]`.\n4. We use a regular expression `r\"^[aeiou]\"` to check if the word starts with a vowel.\n5. If the word starts with a vowel, we append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n6. If the word does not start with a vowel, we find the index of the first vowel using `findfirst`, then we move the consonant(s) before the first vowel to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n7. The transformed word is stored in `results[i]`.\n8. Finally, we return the `results` vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that words contain only lowercase letters. You may need to modify it to handle uppercase letters, punctuation, or other special cases as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[100,425],"elapsed":9.001716958,"cost":0.006675,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18574,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
