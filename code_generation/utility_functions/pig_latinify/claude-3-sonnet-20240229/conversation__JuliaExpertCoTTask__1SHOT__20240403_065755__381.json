It creates a new vector `results` to store the transformed strings. It then uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over the input vector in parallel, transforming each word to its Pig Latin form and storing the result in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n\nThe transformation follows the standard rules of Pig Latin:\n\n- If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end.\n- If the word starts with a consonant, move the consonant(s) to the end and append \"ay\".\n\nThe helper function `isvowel` checks if a character is a vowel (lowercase only).\n\nThe final line calls `pig_latinify` with the example input `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`.\n\nNote: The `@threads` macro spawns a new thread for each iteration of the loop, so it may not be efficient for small inputs or on systems with limited resources. For large inputs or computationally intensive tasks, using threads can provide performance benefits by utilizing multiple CPU cores.","status":200,"tokens":[174,490],"elapsed":9.878541459,"cost":0.007872,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22306,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
