[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses multithreading with `@threads` to parallelize the transformation process, ensuring that each word is processed on a separate thread.\n\n2. `transform_word(word::AbstractString)::String`: This helper function handles the actual transformation of a single word into its Pig Latin form. It follows the standard rules of Pig Latin:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end.\n   - If the word starts with one or more consonants, the consonant cluster is moved to the end, and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nThe `transform_word` function uses a regular expression to extract the initial consonant cluster (if any) from the word. It then constructs the Pig Latin form by concatenating the remaining part of the word with the initial consonant cluster and the appropriate suffix (\"ay\" or \"way\").\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia-repl\njulia> pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"])\n[\"appleyay\", \"ananabay\", \"errychhay\"]\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings are valid words and does not handle edge cases such as empty strings or non-word inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[346,736],"elapsed":14.939486792,"cost":0.012078,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30422,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
