[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a `Vector{String}` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty `Vector{String}` called `pig_latin_words` with the same length as the input vector.\n3. It uses the `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n4. For each word, it checks if the word starts with a vowel (using the `startswith` function and the `isvowel` helper function).\n5. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n6. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst` and the `isvowel` helper function.\n7. If there are no vowels in the word, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n8. If there are vowels in the word, it splits the word into the consonant cluster (before the first vowel) and the rest of the word, moves the consonant cluster to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n9. The transformed word is stored in the `pig_latin_words` vector at the same index as the original word.\n10. Finally, it returns the `pig_latin_words` vector.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"python\", \"rhythm\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nellohay\norldway\nappleyay\nythonpay\nrythmay\n```\n\nNote: The `isvowel` helper function assumes only lowercase vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`). If you need to handle uppercase vowels or other language-specific vowels, you'll need to modify the `isvowel` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[345,760],"elapsed":13.527058708,"cost":0.012435,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24018,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
