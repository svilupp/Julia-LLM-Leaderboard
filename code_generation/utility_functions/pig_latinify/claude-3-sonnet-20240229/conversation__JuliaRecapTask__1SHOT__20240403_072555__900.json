[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `result` to store the transformed Pig Latin strings.\n3. It uses the `@threads` macro to run the loop iterations in parallel, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n4. For each word in `words`, it calls the `pig_latin` function to transform the word into its Pig Latin form and stores the result in the corresponding index of the `result` vector.\n5. Finally, it returns the `result` vector containing the transformed Pig Latin strings.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and applies the following rules to transform it into Pig Latin:\n\n- If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), it adds \"way\" to the end of the word.\n- If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the consonant(s) to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n- If the word contains no vowels, it simply adds \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nIn the example usage, a vector of words `[\"hello\", \"Apple\", \"computer\", \"syntax\"]` is transformed into their Pig Latin counterparts using the `pig_latinify` function, and the resulting vector is printed to the console.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that all input strings are valid words. If you need to handle more complex cases (e.g., words with punctuation, capitalization, etc.), you may need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[345,647],"elapsed":11.981582083,"cost":0.01074,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8119,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
