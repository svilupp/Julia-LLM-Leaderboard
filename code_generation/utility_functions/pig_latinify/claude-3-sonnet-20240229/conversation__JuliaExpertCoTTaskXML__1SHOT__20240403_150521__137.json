It spawns a new thread for each iteration using `@threads` to perform the transformations in parallel.\n\n2. `pig_latin` is a helper function that takes a single string and transforms it to pig latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n   - If the word starts with consonants, move the consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\"\n   - If the word contains no vowels, add \"ay\" to the end\n\nThe `findfirst` function is used to find the index of the first vowel in the word.","status":200,"tokens":[208,468],"elapsed":10.427605,"cost":0.007644,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3063,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
