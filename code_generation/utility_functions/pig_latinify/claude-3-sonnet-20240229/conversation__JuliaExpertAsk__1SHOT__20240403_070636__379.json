It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    n = length(strings)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        result[i] = pig_latin(strings[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_vowel_idx = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n    if first_vowel_idx === nothing\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif first_vowel_idx == 1\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[first_vowel_idx:end] * word[1:first_vowel_idx-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis defines two functions:\n\n1. `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with each string transformed into Pig Latin. It uses `@threads` to run the transformation for each string on a separate thread.\n\n2. `pig_latin` is a helper function that takes a single string and transforms it into Pig Latin following the standard rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, move the consonant cluster to the end and append \"ay\".\n   - If the word contains no vowels, append \"ay\" to the end.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that you have enough threads available on your system to handle the parallel execution. If you have a large number of strings, you may want to consider using a different parallelization strategy, such as splitting the work into chunks or using a different parallel construct like `pmap`.","status":200,"tokens":[95,419],"elapsed":8.750547542,"cost":0.0065699999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16232,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
