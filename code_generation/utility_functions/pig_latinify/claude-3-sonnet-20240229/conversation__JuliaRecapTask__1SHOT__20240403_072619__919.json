[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `result` of the same length as `words` to store the Pig Latin versions of each string.\n3. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over `words`. Each iteration `i` is run on a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`.\n4. Inside the loop, the `pig_latin` function is called on `words[i]`, and the result is stored in `result[i]`.\n5. After the loop completes, `result` is returned, containing the Pig Latin versions of all the input strings.\n6. The `pig_latin` function takes a single string `word` as input.\n7. It first checks if the first character of `word` is a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of `word`.\n8. If the first character is not a vowel, it finds the index `i` of the first vowel in `word`.\n9. If no vowel is found, it appends \"ay\" to the end of `word`.\n10. If a vowel is found, it moves the consonant(s) before the first vowel to the end of `word` and appends \"ay\".\n\nIn the example usage, the `pig_latinify` function is called with a vector of strings `[\"hello\", \"world\", \"computer\", \"science\"]`, and the resulting Pig Latin words are printed.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input strings contain only alphabetic characters. You may want to add additional checks or preprocessing steps if you need to handle other types of characters or strings.","status":200,"tokens":[345,673],"elapsed":12.484899333,"cost":0.01113,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4479,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
