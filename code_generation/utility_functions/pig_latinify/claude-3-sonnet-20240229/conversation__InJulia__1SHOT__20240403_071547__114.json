The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `results` of the same length as `words` to store the transformed strings.\n3. It uses the `@threads` macro to launch a separate thread for each index `i` in the range `1:n` (where `n` is the length of `words`).\n4. In each thread, the `transform_word` function is called on the corresponding word `words[i]`, and the result is stored in `results[i]`.\n5. After all threads have completed, the `results` vector containing the transformed words is returned.\n\nThe `transform_word` function performs the actual transformation of a single word into Pig Latin form:\n\n1. It defines a string `vowels` containing all the vowels.\n2. If the first character of the word is a vowel (case-insensitive), the word is simply appended with \"way\".\n3. Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel in the word (case-insensitive).\n4. If no vowel is found, the word is appended with \"ay\".\n5. If a vowel is found, the word is transformed by moving the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word to the end and appending \"ay\".\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nellohay\norldway\nythonpay\nuliajay\nogrammingpray\n```\n\nNote that the `@threads` macro uses Julia's built-in task parallelism to launch separate threads for each iteration. This can provide performance benefits on multi-core systems, but be aware of potential race conditions or other concurrency issues when modifying shared data structures from multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[58,733],"elapsed":13.346595208,"cost":0.011169,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-473,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
