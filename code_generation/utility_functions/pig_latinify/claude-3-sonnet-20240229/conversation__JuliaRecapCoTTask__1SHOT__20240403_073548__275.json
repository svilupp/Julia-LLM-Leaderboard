[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `@threads` macro to run the loop iterations in parallel on separate threads.\n2. For each word, it checks if the first character is a vowel or not using a `Set` of vowels.\n3. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n4. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel, splits the word into a prefix (consonants before the vowel) and a suffix (vowel and rest of the word), and constructs the pig latin version by appending the prefix to the end of the suffix and adding \"ay\".\n5. The transformed word is pushed into the `results` vector.\n6. After iterating over all the words, it returns the `results` vector.\n\nThis implementation uses multithreading to parallelize the pig latin transformation of each word, potentially improving performance for large input vectors.\n\nNote that this solution assumes the Special Instructions to be empty, as no specific instructions were provided.
