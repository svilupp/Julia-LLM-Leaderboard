[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It handles empty input vectors and pre-allocates the output vector for efficiency.\n\n2. `pig_latin` takes a single string and applies the Pig Latin transformation rules. It handles empty strings, checks if the word starts with a vowel, and moves the consonant cluster to the end, appending \"ay\". If there are no vowels, it simply appends \"ay\".\n\nThe example at the end demonstrates how to use `pig_latinify` with a sample vector of words.","status":200,"tokens":[346,600],"elapsed":12.203755667,"cost":0.010038000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27676,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
