The function takes a `Vector{String}` as input.\n2. It initializes a `results` vector to store the transformed strings.\n3. The `@threads for` loop iterates over each word in the input vector, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n4. For each word, it checks if it starts with a vowel (using `startswith` and a list of vowels). If it does, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n5. If the word doesn't start with a vowel, it finds the index of the first vowel using `findfirst` and a list of vowels.\n6. If no vowel is found, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n7. If a vowel is found, it moves the consonant(s) before the first vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n8. The transformed word is stored in the `results` vector at the corresponding index.\n9. Finally, the function returns the `results` vector containing the transformed strings.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module to enable multi-threading. Each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread, allowing for parallel execution and potentially faster processing for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[100,548],"elapsed":9.512305208,"cost":0.00852,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22054,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
