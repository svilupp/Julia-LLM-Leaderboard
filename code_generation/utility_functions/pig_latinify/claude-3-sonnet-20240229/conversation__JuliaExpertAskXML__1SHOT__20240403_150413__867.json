Here's how it works:\n\n1. We initialize an output vector `results` to store the pig latin versions of the input strings.\n2. We use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over each string in the input vector.\n3. For each string `word`, we check if it starts with a vowel using a regular expression `^[aeiou]`.\n4. If it does start with a vowel, we simply append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n5. If it starts with a consonant, we use another regular expression `^[^aeiou]+` to find the longest sequence of consonants at the beginning of the word.\n6. We then move this sequence of consonants to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n7. The transformed string is stored in the `results` vector at the same index as the original string.\n\nThe use of `Threads.@threads` ensures that each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread, taking advantage of parallelism for improved performance when transforming a large number of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[100,436],"elapsed":7.047353334,"cost":0.00684,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16843,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
