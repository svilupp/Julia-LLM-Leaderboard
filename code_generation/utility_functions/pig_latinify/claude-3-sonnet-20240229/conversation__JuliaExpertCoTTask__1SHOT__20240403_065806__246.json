The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It uses the `@sync` macro to ensure that all asynchronous tasks complete before returning the final output.\n3. It creates an output vector `output` of the same length as `words` to store the pig latinified strings.\n4. It iterates over each word in `words` using `enumerate`, and for each word, it spawns a new asynchronous task using `@async` to process the word using the `pig_latin` function.\n5. The `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input and applies the pig latin transformation rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, it moves the consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\".\n6. The `pig_latinify` function returns the `output` vector containing the pig latinified words.\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, simply call it with a vector of strings, and it will return a new vector with the pig latinified versions of those strings.\n\nNote: This solution uses Julia's built-in `Distributed` module to handle parallel processing of the words. It assumes that you have set up a multi-worker environment using `addprocs` or similar methods. If you run this code on a single-worker environment, it will still work, but it won't take advantage of parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[174,603],"elapsed":11.294965459,"cost":0.009567,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24942,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
