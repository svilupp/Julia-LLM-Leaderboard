The `to_pig_latin` function takes a word as input and converts it to its pig latin form.\n2. It first checks if the word starts with a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n3. If the word starts with consonants, it moves them to the end and appends \"ay\".\n4. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of words as input.\n5. It creates a result vector to store the pig latin versions of the words.\n6. It uses the `@threads` macro to run the loop iterations in parallel, with each iteration converting one word to pig latin using `to_pig_latin`.\n7. The pig latin versions of the words are stored in the `results` vector, which is returned.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input words are all lowercase. You may need to modify it to handle uppercase letters or other special cases as per your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[174,482],"elapsed":9.353394375,"cost":0.007752,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30928,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
