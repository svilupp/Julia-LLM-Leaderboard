[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It creates a new vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n3. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the input vector. Each iteration runs on a separate thread.\n4. Inside the loop, the `pig_latin` function is called on each word, and the result is stored in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n5. The `pig_latin` function does the actual transformation:\n   - It handles the empty string case by returning an empty string.\n   - It finds the index of the first vowel in the word using the `findfirst` function and the `isvowel` helper function.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, it simply appends \"way\" to the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant cluster, it moves the consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n6. The `isvowel` helper function checks if a given character is a vowel.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"julia\", \"algorithm\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nellohay\norldway\nythonpay\nuliajay\nalgorithmway\n```\n\nNote that the parallelization using `@threads` will only provide a performance benefit if the vector of words is large enough to justify the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads. For small vectors, the overhead may outweigh the benefits of parallelization.","status":200,"tokens":[345,757],"elapsed":13.211531375,"cost":0.01239,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":23175,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
