[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It uses `Threads.nthreads()` to get the number of available threads and creates an output vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n3. The `@threads` macro from the `Base.Threads` module is used to spawn a separate thread for each string in the input vector.\n4. Inside the loop, the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is called for each string, and the result is stored in the `results` vector.\n5. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function takes a single string as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation:\n   - If the first character is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the string.\n   - If the first character is a consonant, it moves the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word to the end and appends \"ay\".\n6. Finally, the `pig_latinify` function returns the vector of transformed strings.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\noriginal_strings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latin_strings = pig_latinify(original_strings)\nprintln.(pig_latin_strings)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nellohay\norldway\nappleyay\nananabay\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings are valid and only consist of lowercase letters. You may want to add additional checks or error handling if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[345,667],"elapsed":13.675388334,"cost":0.01104,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22430,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
