[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It initializes a vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n3. A helper function `transform_string` is defined to perform the actual pig latin transformation on a single string.\n   - It checks if the first character is a vowel or not.\n   - If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the string.\n   - If it's a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel, moves the consonant(s) to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n   - If the string doesn't contain any vowels, it simply appends \"ay\" to the end.\n4. The `@threads` macro is used to create and run a separate thread for each string in the input vector.\n   - Each thread calls the `transform_string` function with the corresponding string and its index in the `results` vector.\n   - The transformed string is stored in the `results` vector at the corresponding index.\n5. Finally, the `results` vector containing the transformed strings is returned.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the `pig_latinify` function with a sample vector of strings.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input strings contain only alphabetic characters. If you need to handle other characters, you may need to modify the `transform_string` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[346,602],"elapsed":11.421229292,"cost":0.010068,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1483,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
