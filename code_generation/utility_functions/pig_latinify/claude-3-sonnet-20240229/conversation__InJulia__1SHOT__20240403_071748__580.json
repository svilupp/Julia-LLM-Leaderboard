The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `transformed_words` to store the Pig Latin versions of the input strings.\n3. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the input vector `words` using multithreading.\n4. For each string in the input vector, the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is called to convert it to Pig Latin.\n5. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function:\n   - Checks if the input word is empty and returns it unchanged if it is.\n   - Checks if the first character is a vowel (using the `vowels` array). If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the first character is a consonant, it finds the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word and moves it to the end, then appends \"ay\".\n6. The transformed Pig Latin strings are stored in the `transformed_words` vector.\n7. Finally, the `transformed_words` vector is returned as the result.\n\nYou can use the `pig_latinify` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln.(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nellohay\norldway\nigpay\natinlay\n```\n\nNote that the `@threads` macro in Julia automatically creates and manages threads for parallel execution. The number of threads used will be equal to the number of available CPU threads on your system.","status":200,"tokens":[58,675],"elapsed":12.225495958,"cost":0.010299,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9132,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
