The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It creates a new vector `result` of the same length to store the Pig Latin strings.\n3. It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over the input vector with multithreading.\n4. For each string in the input vector, it calls the `to_pig_latin` function to transform it to Pig Latin and stores the result in the corresponding index of the `result` vector.\n5. The `to_pig_latin` function takes a single string as input and follows the Pig Latin rules:\n   - If the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word begins with one or more consonants, move the consonants to the end and add \"ay\".\n   - If the word contains no vowels, add \"ay\" to the end.\n6. The `pig_latinify` function returns the `result` vector containing the Pig Latin strings.\n\nThe output of `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])` will be:\n\n```julia\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input strings contain only lowercase letters. You may need to modify the code to handle uppercase letters and other characters if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[174,585],"elapsed":11.605861625,"cost":0.009297,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1337,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
