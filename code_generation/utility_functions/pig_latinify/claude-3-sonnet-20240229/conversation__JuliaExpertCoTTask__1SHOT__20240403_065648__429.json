The length of the input vector is calculated and a new vector `results` is preallocated to store the transformed words.\n2. The `@threads` macro is used to run the loop iterations on separate threads, parallelizing the computation.\n3. For each word in the input vector:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end.\n   - If the word starts with consonants, the consonant cluster at the start is moved to the end, and \"ay\" is appended.\n4. The transformed word is stored in the `results` vector at the corresponding index.\n5. The `results` vector containing the pig latin words is returned.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates calling the function with the given data and printing the resulting pig latin words.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input words only contain lowercase letters. Modifications would be needed to handle uppercase letters, punctuation, etc.","status":200,"tokens":[174,486],"elapsed":9.887366208,"cost":0.007812,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28258,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
