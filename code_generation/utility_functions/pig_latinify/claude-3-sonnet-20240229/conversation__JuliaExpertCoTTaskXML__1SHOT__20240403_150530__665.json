It pre-allocates a result vector of the same length using `Vector{String}(undef, length(words))`. Then it uses `Threads.@threads` to iterate over each word in parallel, transforming it to pig latin using the `pig_latin` function, and storing the result in the corresponding index of the result vector.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single word as input. It first checks if the first letter is a vowel, and if so, appends `\"way\"` to the end. Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel, moves that vowel and subsequent characters to the start, appends the consonant(s) at the end, and finally adds `\"ay\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[208,468],"elapsed":9.354845333,"cost":0.007644,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1800,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
