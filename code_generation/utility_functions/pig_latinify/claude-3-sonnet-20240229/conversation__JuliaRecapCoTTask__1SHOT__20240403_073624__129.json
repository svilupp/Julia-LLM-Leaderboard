[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. It initializes an empty vector `results` to store the transformed words.\n3. Using the `@threads` macro, it iterates over each word in the input vector, running each iteration on a separate thread.\n4. For each word, it checks if the first character is a vowel using the `isvowel` helper function.\n5. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n6. If the word starts with consonants, it moves the consonants to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n7. The transformed word is stored in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n8. Finally, the `results` vector containing the transformed words is returned.\n\nThe `isvowel` helper function checks if a character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or not.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input vector of strings is not too large, as creating too many threads can lead to performance issues due to overhead. If the input vector is very large, you may want to consider batching the words and processing them in smaller groups of threads.","status":200,"tokens":[346,529],"elapsed":10.594024042,"cost":0.008973,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25168,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
