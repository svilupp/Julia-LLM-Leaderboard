We create a vector `result` to store the Pig Latin translations.\n2. We use `@threads` to run each iteration of the loop on a separate thread. This allows the computation to be parallelized, potentially speeding up the execution.\n3. For each word in `words`, we check if the first letter is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`). If so, we add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n4. If the first letter is a consonant, we use a regular expression `^[^aeiou]+` to match the consecutive consonants at the start of the word.\n5. If there is a match, we move the matched consonants to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n6. If there is no match (e.g., the word starts with a vowel), we add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n7. The translated word is stored in the `result` vector.\n8. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing all the Pig Latin translations.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n# Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nNote: The `@threads` macro requires Julia's multi-threading capabilities, which may not be available on all systems or configurations. If you encounter any issues, you can remove the `@threads` macro and the loop will run sequentially.","status":200,"tokens":[174,586],"elapsed":11.886232041,"cost":0.009312,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
