The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. We create a results vector to store the pig latin transformed strings.\n3. We use `@threads` to parallelize the loop over each word in the input vector.\n4. For each word:\n    - If the word starts with a vowel, we append \"way\" to the end.\n    - If the word starts with consonants, we move the consonants to the end and append \"ay\".\n5. The transformed word is stored in the `results` vector at the corresponding index.\n6. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the pig latin transformed words.\n\nThe `ismatch` function is used to check if the word starts with a vowel or consonant using regular expressions. The `match` function extracts the matched part of the string.\n\nExample output:\n```\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"appleyay\"\n \"ongtray\"\n \"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[174,427],"elapsed":8.583343542,"cost":0.006927,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":14235,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
