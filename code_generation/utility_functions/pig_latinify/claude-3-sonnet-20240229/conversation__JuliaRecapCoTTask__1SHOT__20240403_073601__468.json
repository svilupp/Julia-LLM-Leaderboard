[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how it works:\n\n1. We first create an empty vector `results` to store the transformed strings. Its length is the same as the input vector `strings`.\n2. We then use the `@threads` macro to iterate over the `strings` vector in parallel, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n3. For each string `word` in `strings`, we check if it starts with a vowel using the regular expression `r\"^[aeiou]\"`.\n4. If `word` starts with a vowel, we simply append \"way\" to the end of the string and store it in `results[i]`.\n5. If `word` starts with consonants, we find the index of the first vowel using `findfirst(vowels, word)`. We then split the word into the consonant part (`consonants`) and the remaining part (`rest`). Finally, we construct the Pig Latin word by concatenating `rest`, `consonants`, and \"ay\", and store it in `results[i]`.\n6. After iterating over all words, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed strings in Pig Latin.\n\nNote that we're using the `Base.Threads` module to enable parallel processing. If you're running this code on a single-threaded environment (e.g., a Jupyter notebook), you might need to add `using Distributed` and `addprocs()` before running `pig_latinify`.","status":200,"tokens":[346,520],"elapsed":12.251612375,"cost":0.008838,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1824,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
