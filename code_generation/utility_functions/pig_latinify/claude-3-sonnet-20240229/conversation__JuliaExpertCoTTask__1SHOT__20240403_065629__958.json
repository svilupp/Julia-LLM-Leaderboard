We define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings `words`.\n2. We get the length `n` of the input vector.\n3. We initialize a result vector `results` of length `n` to store the transformed strings.\n4. We use `@threads` macro to run the loop iterations in separate threads.\n5. Inside the loop, we take each word from the input vector.\n6. We check if the first character of the word is a vowel.\n7. If it's a vowel, we append \"way\" to the word.\n8. If it's a consonant, we move the first character to the end and append \"ay\".\n9. We store the transformed word in the `results` vector at the corresponding index.\n10. Finally, we return the `results` vector containing the transformed words in pig latin.\n\nThe `@threads` macro allows us to run the loop iterations in parallel, taking advantage of multiple cores/threads on the system. This can provide a performance boost for larger input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[174,441],"elapsed":8.960554834,"cost":0.007137,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25134,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
