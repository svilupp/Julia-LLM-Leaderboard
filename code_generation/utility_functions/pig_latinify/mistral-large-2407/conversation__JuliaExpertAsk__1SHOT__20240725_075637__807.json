Here's a concise implementation of a `pig_latinify` function in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and transforms each string to Pig Latin using separate threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        end\n        first_char = word[1]\n        if first_char in 'a':'z' || first_char in 'A':'Z'\n            return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word\n        end\n    end\n\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings, transforms each string to Pig Latin using the `to_pig_latin` helper function, and runs each transformation in a separate thread. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[102,345],"elapsed":7.035214958,"cost":0.003411,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":124622610,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
