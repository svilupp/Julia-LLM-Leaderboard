Below is a Julia implementation of a Pig Latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. Each string is processed in a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)::String\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Move the first consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\"\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if first_vowel_index === nothing\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"umbrella\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify_vector(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **pig_latinify Function**:\n   - This function takes a single word and converts it to Pig Latin.\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. **pig_latinify_vector Function**:\n   - This function takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each string in a separate thread.\n   - The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - An example vector of words is provided, and the `pig_latinify_vector` function is called to transform each word to Pig Latin.\n   - The result is printed to the console.\n\nTo run this code, ensure that Julia is started with multiple threads. You can do this by starting Julia with the `-t` command-line argument, for example:\n\n```sh\njulia -t 4\n```\n\nThis will start Julia with 4 threads. Adjust the number of threads as needed based on your system's capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[61,661],"elapsed":16.552714375,"cost":0.006132,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":909751282,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
