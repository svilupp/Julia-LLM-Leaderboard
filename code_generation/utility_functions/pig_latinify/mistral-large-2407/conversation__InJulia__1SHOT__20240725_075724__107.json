Below is a Julia script that defines a `pig_latinify` function. This function operates on a vector of strings and transforms each string into Pig Latin. Each transformation is performed on a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)::String\n    # Check if the word is empty\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n\n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Move the first consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\"\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(c -> c in vowels, word)\n        if first_vowel_index === nothing\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Ensure that the number of threads is set appropriately\n    if nthreads() == 1\n        @warn \"Only one thread is available. Consider starting Julia with multiple threads using the -t command line argument.\"\n    end\n\n    # Initialize a vector to store the results\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Use multi-threading to process each word\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(words))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`pig_latinify_word` Function**:\n   - This function takes a single word and converts it to Pig Latin.\n   - It checks if the word starts with a vowel. If it does, it appends \"way\" to the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. **`pig_latinify` Function**:\n   - This function takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify_word` function to each string using multi-threading.\n   - It initializes a result vector to store the transformed strings.\n   - The `@threads` macro is used to distribute the workload across multiple threads.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - The example demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of words.\n\n### Note:\n- To run this script with multiple threads, start Julia with the `-t` command line argument. For example, to start Julia with 4 threads, use `julia -t 4`.\n- The script includes a warning if only one thread is available, reminding the user to start Julia with multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[61,766],"elapsed":17.943298542,"cost":0.007077,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1025155884,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
