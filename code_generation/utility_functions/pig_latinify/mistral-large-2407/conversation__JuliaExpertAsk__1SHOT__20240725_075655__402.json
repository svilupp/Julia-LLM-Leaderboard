Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a concise implementation of a `pig_latinify` function in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and uses multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    end\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if first_char in \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function for a single word and another for a vector of strings. The latter uses multithreading to process each word in parallel. Make sure to start Julia with multiple threads using the `-t` command line argument, e.g., `julia -t 4`.","status":200,"tokens":[102,279],"elapsed":5.603667917,"cost":0.002817,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2018917312,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
