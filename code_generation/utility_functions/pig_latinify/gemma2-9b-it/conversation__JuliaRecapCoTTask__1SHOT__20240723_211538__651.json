[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If so, it appends \"way\" to the word. \n\n      *   The `else` block first creates a new array from the string and swaps the first two elements (this is how we achieve the shift) and then converts the array back into a string. finally it appends \"ay\". **Note**: For this specific piglatin implementation, vowels are assumed to be A, E, I, O, U\n      *   The pig latin word is not explicitly returned.\n\n\n3.  **Additional Helper Functions:**\n    *   `isvowelfirst`: Checks if the first character of a word is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` ).\n    *   `shift_first`: Shifts the first character of a word to the second position.\n\n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Multithreading for Performance:** Using `Threads.@threads` partitions the work of transforming strings into parallel tasks, potentially improving execution speed, especially for large input vectors.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore alternative implementations or have any specific performance optimizations in mind!","status":200,"tokens":[337,589],"elapsed":1.804821041,"cost":0.0001852,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1212910828,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
