We use `Threads.map` to apply the pig latin transformation to each string in the input vector `strings` concurrently.\n   - The anonymous function `(s) -> reverse(s[1:end-1]) . \"a\" . s[end]` performs the pig latin conversion:\n      - `s[1:end-1]` takes all characters except the last one.\n      - `reverse(s[1:end-1])` reverses these characters.\n      - `\".\"` concatenates the reversed string, \"a\" and the last character.\n   - `Threads.map` distributes these function applications across multiple threads, parallelizing the pig latin conversion.\n\n4. **`return Threads.gather(threads)`**: This gathers the results from all the threads and returns them as a vector, giving you the pig latin versions of all your original strings.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: The code demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with sample text.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore more advanced threading techniques in Julia!","status":200,"tokens":[65,488],"elapsed":1.215020667,"cost":0.0001106,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":483837192,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
