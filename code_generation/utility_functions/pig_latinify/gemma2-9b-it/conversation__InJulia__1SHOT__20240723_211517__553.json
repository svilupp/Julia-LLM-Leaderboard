This is a concise way to implement pig latin:\n         - `s[1...]` gets all characters except the first.\n         - `.=>` concatenates the first letter `s[1]` to the end of the string.\n         - `+= `appends \"way\" to the end.\n     - `gather(threads...)` waits for all threads to finish and returns their results.\n3. **`main` function:**\n   - Demonstrates how to use `pig_latinify`.\n   - Defines an example `texts` vector.\n   - Calls `pig_latinify` to transform the texts in parallel.\n   - Prints the original and pig latinified texts.\n\n**How multithreading works:**\n\n- The `@async` macro allows you to define asynchronous functions. These functions run concurrently with other `@async` blocks.\n- When you collect the results using `gather`, Julia waits for each asynchronous function to complete and returns their results in the same order they were submitted.","status":200,"tokens":[65,558],"elapsed":1.399997917,"cost":0.0001246,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-392698347,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
