Otherwise, the string remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Asynchronous Processing:** \n   - `futures = @time Threads.map(threads_to_use, transform!, strings)`: This line starts the asynchronous transformations, creating a Futures array. The `@time` macro measures the execution time.\n\n4. **Collecting Results:** \n   -  `transformed_strings = collect(futures)` waits for all threads to complete and gathers the transformed strings from the Futures array.\n\n5. **Example Usage:** \n   -  The code demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function on a sample vector of strings and prints the results.\n\n\n\n\n **Important Notes:**\n\n-  The `transform!` function modifies the original string in-place. If you need to preserve the original strings, make a copy before passing it to `pig_latinify`.\n- Threads perform well when dealing with independent tasks. If your strings have dependencies or require shared resources, you might need to consider alternative approaches like thread-safe data structures or other concurrency mechanisms.","status":200,"tokens":[65,668],"elapsed":1.926942458,"cost":0.00014659999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1601580111,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
