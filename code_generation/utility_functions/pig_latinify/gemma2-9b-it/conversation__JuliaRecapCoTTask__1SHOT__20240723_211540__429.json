[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `thread_worker` function is responsible for performing the pig latin conversion. \n3. **Pig Latin Conversion (`pigLatin`):** \n   - It handles words starting with digits (`0-9`) by appending \"way\". \n   - For other words, it reverses the characters after the first letter and appends \"ay\".\n4. **Thread Safety:** Each `thread_worker` function operates on a single sentence independently, ensuring thread safety.\n\n5. **Efficiently Joining Threads:**\n    - `Threads.collect()` creates a new vector containing the results from all the worker threads. \n    \n**Key Concepts:**\n\n- **`Threads`:** The Julia package for multithreading. \n- **Parallelism:** Expands the code's efficiency by processing each sentence concurrently, saving execution time.\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- This solution likely benefits most from multiple cores. \n\n- For extremely large input datasets, more sophisticated thread management techniques (e.g., thread pooling) might be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[337,520],"elapsed":1.631775041,"cost":0.0001714,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1665261055,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
