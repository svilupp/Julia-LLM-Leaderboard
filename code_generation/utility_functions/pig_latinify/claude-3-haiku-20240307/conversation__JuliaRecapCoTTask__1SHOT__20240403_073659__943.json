[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `transform_word` function is defined as an inner function that performs the pig latinification of a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and adds \"way\" to the end, or it finds the first vowel and moves the consonants before it to the end, adding \"ay\".\n2. The `@everywhere` macro is used to make the `transform_word` function available on all worker processes.\n3. A `Channel` is created to collect the transformed words from the separate threads.\n4. The `@sync` and `@spawn` macros are used to iterate over the input strings and transform each one on a separate thread, putting the transformed words into the channel.\n5. Finally, the transformed words are collected from the channel and returned as a vector.\n\nThe solution leverages Julia's built-in support for parallel processing and the `@everywhere` macro to ensure that the `transform_word` function is available on all worker processes. This allows each string transformation to run on a separate thread, improving the overall performance of the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[346,616],"elapsed":6.136700125,"cost":0.0008565000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4241,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
