It uses a comprehension and the `@thr_pig_latinify` function to process each word on a separate thread.\n\nThe `thr_pig_latinify` function is a helper function that performs the pig latin transformation on a single word. It first checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case it simply appends \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves the initial consonants to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nThe solution ensures that the transformation is applied to each word in parallel, improving performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[208,373],"elapsed":3.800712916,"cost":0.00051825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27262,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
