The `transform_to_pig_latin` function is a helper function that takes a single word and applies the Pig Latin transformation rules to it. It checks if the word starts with a vowel and appends \"way\" if it does, or it finds the first vowel, moves the consonants before it to the end, and appends \"ay\" if it doesn't.\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process. The `@threads` macro ensures that each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread.\n3. Inside the loop, the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is called on each word, and the modified word is assigned back to the original position in the input vector.\n4. Finally, the transformed vector of strings is returned.\n\nYou can use the `pig_latinify` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"rogrammingpay\"]\n```\n\nNote that the parallel processing using `@threads` will only work if your machine has multiple cores available. If you have a single-core machine, the parallel processing will not provide any performance benefits.","status":200,"tokens":[58,662],"elapsed":6.01564425,"cost":0.0008420000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16881,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
