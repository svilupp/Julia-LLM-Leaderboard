The `to_pig_latin` function handles the conversion of a single string to Pig Latin.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each string.\n2. The `to_pig_latin` function handles the Pig Latin transformation logic for a single string.\n3. The function is concise and only performs the necessary operations.","status":200,"tokens":[100,349],"elapsed":4.032403916,"cost":0.00046125000000000007,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20132,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
