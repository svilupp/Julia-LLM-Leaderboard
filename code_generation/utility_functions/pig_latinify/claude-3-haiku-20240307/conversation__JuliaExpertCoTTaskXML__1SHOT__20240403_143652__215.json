Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of the strings transformed to pig latin.\n2. Inside `pig_latinify`, create a vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n3. Use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string, running each iteration on a separate thread.\n4. In each iteration, call the `to_pig_latin` function to transform the individual string.\n5. The `to_pig_latin` function implements the pig latin transformation logic, handling different cases for words starting with vowels or consonants.\n6. Return the `results` vector containing the transformed strings.\n\nThe solution uses the built-in multithreading capabilities of Julia to parallelize the transformation of each string, which can improve performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[208,482],"elapsed":4.4352395,"cost":0.0006545,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31152,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
