Define a `pig_latin` function that transforms a single word to its pig latin equivalent.\n2. Define the `pig_latinify` function that maps the `pig_latin` function over the input vector of strings.\n3. Use `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the transformation of each word.\n4. Test the solution with the provided example data.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"applenay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[208,349],"elapsed":3.659327792,"cost":0.0004882500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9451,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
