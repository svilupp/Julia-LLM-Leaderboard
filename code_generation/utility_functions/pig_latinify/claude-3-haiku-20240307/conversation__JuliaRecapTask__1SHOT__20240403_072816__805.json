X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `to_pig_latin` function is a helper function that transforms a single word to Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it finds the first vowel position, and moves the consonant prefix to the end, appending \"ay\".\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with the Pig Latin transformed words.\n\n3. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, we create a thread-safe output vector `output` to store the transformed words.\n\n4. We then use the `@threads` macro to iterate over the input words in parallel and apply the `to_pig_latin` function to each word, storing the result in the `output` vector.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the `output` vector containing the Pig Latin transformed words.\n\nThis solution leverages Julia's built-in support for parallelism using the `@threads` macro, which distributes the work across available threads. This can provide a significant performance boost, especially for larger input vectors.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"isay\", \"awesomeway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[345,626],"elapsed":6.205924042,"cost":0.0008687500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":15041,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
