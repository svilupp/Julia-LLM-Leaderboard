It uses the `@threads` macro to run the transformation on each string in the input vector `words` using separate threads.\n2. For each string, it first checks if the string is empty or if the first character is not a letter. If so, it skips the transformation and moves to the next string.\n3. It then checks if the first character of the word is a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n4. If the word does not start with a vowel, it finds the index of the first vowel in the word. If there are no vowels, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n5. If there are vowels, it moves the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n6. The transformed words are then stored back in the `words` vector, and the function returns the updated vector.\n\nNote that the use of `@threads` for the transformation allows the function to take advantage of multiple cores or threads on the host machine, potentially improving the performance of the transformation, especially for a large input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[100,618],"elapsed":7.000400416,"cost":0.0007975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17565,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
