[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that meets the task requirements and follows the special instructions, if any:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = transform_to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction transform_to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", word, ignorecase=true)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        matches = match(r\"^([^aeiou]+)(.*)\", word, ignorecase=true)\n        if matches !== nothing\n            return matches.captures[2] * matches.captures[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the same vector with each string transformed to pig latin.\n2. The function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process, with each iteration running on a separate thread.\n3. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function is a helper function that performs the pig latin transformation on a single string.\n4. The transformation rules are as follows:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (case-insensitive), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, move the leading consonant(s) to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n   - If the word does not match the above rules, return the original word.\n\nThe solution follows the provided guidelines and utilizes the built-in parallelism features of Julia to achieve efficient processing of the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[346,415],"elapsed":5.01487225,"cost":0.00060525,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4540,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
