I first define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that takes a single string and converts it to pig latin.\n2. I then define a `process_string` function that will be used in the `@distributed map` call. This function simply calls `to_pig_latin` on the input string.\n3. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, and uses the `@distributed map` function to apply the `process_string` function to each string in parallel.\n\nThe `@everywhere` macro is used to make the `process_string` function available to all worker processes, so that it can be executed in parallel.\n\nThe final result is a vector of the pig latin versions of the input strings, computed in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[174,424],"elapsed":4.092745958,"cost":0.0005735000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1148,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
