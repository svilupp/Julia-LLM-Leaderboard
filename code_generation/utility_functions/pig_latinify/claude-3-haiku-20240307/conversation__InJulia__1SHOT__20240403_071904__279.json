The `to_pig_latin` helper function takes a single word and transforms it to its pig latin equivalent. It checks if the word is short enough or doesn't start with a letter, in which case it just returns the original word. Otherwise, it follows the standard pig latin rules: if the first letter is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word; if the first letter is a consonant, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to apply the `to_pig_latin` function to each word in the vector in parallel. The resulting vector of transformed words is returned.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output a new vector of strings with each word transformed to its pig latin equivalent:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"isway\", \"awesomeway\"]\n```\n\nNote that the order of the transformed words may be different each time you run the code, as the multithreading execution is non-deterministic.","status":200,"tokens":[58,540],"elapsed":5.165328417,"cost":0.0006895,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5730,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
