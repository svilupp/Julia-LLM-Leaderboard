The `pig_latinify` function iterates over the input vector and calls the `pig_latinify_word` function on each word. The `pig_latinify_word` function applies the pig latin transformation rules to a single word.\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to execute the transformation of each word in parallel. This can provide a performance boost, especially for larger input vectors.\n\nThe `main` function is used to demonstrate the usage of the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[208,375],"elapsed":3.64841475,"cost":0.00052075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16061,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
