[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a single string and transforms it to pig latin. It checks if the first character is a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves all the leading consonants to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. The parallel version of `pig_latinify` uses Julia's built-in `@spawn` macro to create a separate thread for each word in the input vector. This allows the transformation to be performed concurrently, which can improve performance for large input vectors.\n\n3. The `fetch` function is used to collect the results from the spawned threads and return the transformed text as a vector of strings.\n\nThe code follows the special instructions provided, and it also adheres to the suggested Julia programming guidelines:\n\n- It uses built-in Julia functions and data structures (e.g., `Vector`, `AbstractString`) without introducing any new packages.\n- It uses general type annotations (e.g., `<:AbstractString`) to allow for flexibility in the input types.\n- It emphasizes performance, clarity, and abstract types.\n- It avoids using reserved names (e.g., `begin`, `end`, `function`).\n- It takes advantage of Julia's multiple dispatch and threading capabilities.\n\nYou can test the code with the example usage provided at the end of the script.","status":200,"tokens":[346,554],"elapsed":5.612491333,"cost":0.0007790000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5664,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
