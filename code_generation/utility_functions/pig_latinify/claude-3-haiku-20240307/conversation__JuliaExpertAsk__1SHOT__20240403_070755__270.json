It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation.\n\n2. `transform_to_pig_latin(word::String)`: This function takes a single string and transforms it to Pig Latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves the leading consonants to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `const vowel_pattern = r\"[aeiou]\"` defines a regular expression pattern to match vowels.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings and print the resulting Pig Latin-ified strings.","status":200,"tokens":[95,394],"elapsed":4.06950275,"cost":0.00051625,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5301,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
