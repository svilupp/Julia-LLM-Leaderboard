We define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, we define a helper function `transform_word` that takes a single string and transforms it to its Pig Latin equivalent. The logic for the transformation is based on the Pig Latin rules: if the word starts with a vowel, we append \"way\" to the end; otherwise, we move the first consonant(s) to the end and append \"ay\".\n\n3. The `@everywhere` macro ensures that the `transform_word` function is available to all worker processes.\n\n4. The main part of the `pig_latinify` function uses a list comprehension to create a vector of `@spawn` expressions, one for each word in the input vector. This will create a new thread for each word and transform it to Pig Latin.\n\n5. Finally, we use the `fetch` function to wait for all the threads to complete and retrieve the transformed words.\n\nThe `fetch` function is used to wait for the results of the parallel computations and collect them into a vector. In the example usage, we store the transformed words in the `pig_latin_words` variable and print the result.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the built-in `@spawn` macro from the `Distributed` package in Julia to create and manage the threads. If you're running this code on a system with multiple cores or processors, it should take advantage of the parallelism and process the words more efficiently than a sequential implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[58,629],"elapsed":5.857451541,"cost":0.00080075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20684,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
