The `pig_latinify` function is defined using the `@everywhere` macro, which ensures that the function is available on all worker processes.\n2. The `transform_strings` function takes a vector of strings as input, and uses the `@everywhere` macro to execute the `pig_latinify` function on each string in parallel.\n3. The `@everywhere` macro in the `transform_strings` function ensures that the `pig_latinify` function is available to all worker processes before executing the transformation in parallel.\n\nNote that you'll need to have the `Distributed` package loaded and have set up a multi-threaded environment for this to work effectively. You can do this by running `using Distributed` and then `addprocs(N)`, where `N` is the number of worker processes you want to use.","status":200,"tokens":[95,517],"elapsed":5.706427625,"cost":0.00067,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
