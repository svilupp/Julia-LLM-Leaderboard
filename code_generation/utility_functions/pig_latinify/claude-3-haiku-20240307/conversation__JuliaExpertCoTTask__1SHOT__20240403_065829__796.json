Implement a `convert_to_pig_latin` function that takes a single word and converts it to pig latin according to the rules.\n2. Use the `@threads` macro to iterate over the input vector of strings and apply the `convert_to_pig_latin` function to each word in parallel.\n3. Return the modified vector of strings.\n\nThe solution uses the `Threads` module to run each iteration on a separate thread, which can improve performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[174,504],"elapsed":4.906401209,"cost":0.0006735,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":3902,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
