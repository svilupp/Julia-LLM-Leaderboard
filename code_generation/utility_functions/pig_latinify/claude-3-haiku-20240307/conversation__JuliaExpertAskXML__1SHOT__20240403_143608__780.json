The `@everywhere` macro is used to define the `transform_word` function, which is responsible for converting a single word to its Pig Latin equivalent. This ensures that the function is available on all worker processes.\n2. The `@sync` and `@distributed` macros are used to parallelize the transformation of the input vector of strings. The `@distributed` macro distributes the work across available worker processes, while the `@sync` block ensures that all tasks complete before the function returns.\n3. The `transform_word` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it finds the first vowel, moves the consonants at the beginning of the word to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n4. The `pig_latinify` function returns the transformed vector of strings.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nmy_strings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\npig_latinized = pig_latinify(my_strings)\n```\n\nThis will transform the input vector of strings to their Pig Latin equivalents using parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[100,457],"elapsed":4.863130959,"cost":0.00059625,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10136,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
