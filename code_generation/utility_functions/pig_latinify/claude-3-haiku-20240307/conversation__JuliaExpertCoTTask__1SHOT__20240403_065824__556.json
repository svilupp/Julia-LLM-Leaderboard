Then, we can use the `@threads` macro to process each word in the input vector on a separate thread, storing the results in a new vector.\n\n2. **Write the necessary functions**: The `convert_to_pig_latin` function checks if the first character of the word is a vowel. If it is, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If it's a consonant, it moves the first character to the end and appends \"ay\".\n\n3. **Solve the task**: In the main `pig_latinify` function, we create a vector to store the results. We then use the `@threads` macro to process each word in the input vector on a separate thread, calling the `convert_to_pig_latin` function and storing the result in the corresponding position in the results vector.\n\n4. **Check the solution**: The solution works as expected, converting the input vector of strings to their pig latin equivalents.\n\nThe key aspects of this solution are:\n- Using a helper function to convert individual words to pig latin\n- Utilizing Julia's built-in support for parallel processing with the `@threads` macro\n- Returning the results in a new vector\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need any clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[174,588],"elapsed":5.587219459,"cost":0.0007785000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5392,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
