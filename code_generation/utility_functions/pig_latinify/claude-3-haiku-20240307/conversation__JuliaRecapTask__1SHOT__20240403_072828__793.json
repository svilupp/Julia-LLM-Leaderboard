[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we define a helper function `transform_word` that takes a single word and converts it to pig latin based on the following rules:\n   - If the word has less than 2 characters, it is returned as is.\n   - If the first character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), the word is appended with \"way\".\n   - Otherwise, the word is transformed by moving the consonants at the beginning to the end and adding \"ay\".\n3. The main part of the `pig_latinify` function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector. This ensures that the transformation of each word is done on a separate thread, improving performance for large input vectors.\n4. Finally, the transformed words are returned as the output of the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nYou can use this `pig_latinify` function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified) # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogramming-pay\"]\n```\n\nThis solution follows the guidelines provided, using Julia's standard library features and focusing on performance, clarity, and abstract types. The parallel transformation of the words ensures efficient processing of large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[345,604],"elapsed":6.052183125,"cost":0.00084125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29722,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
