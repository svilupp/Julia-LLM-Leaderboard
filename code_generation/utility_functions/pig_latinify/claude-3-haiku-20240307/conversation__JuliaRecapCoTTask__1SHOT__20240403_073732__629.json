[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a single string and transforms it to pig latin. The rules are:\n   - If the first character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - Otherwise, move the first consonant to the end and append \"ay\".\n\n2. The main `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input. It first ensures that the `pig_latinify` function is available on all workers using the `@everywhere` macro.\n\n3. Then, we use the `@distributed` macro to parallelize the transformation. The `vcat` function is used to concatenate the results from all the threads into a single vector.\n\n4. The transformed words are returned as the output.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\noriginal_words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(original_words)\nprintln(transformed_words) # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe key points in this solution are:\n- Using the `@distributed` macro to parallelize the transformation on separate threads\n- Ensuring the `pig_latinify` function is available on all workers\n- Returning the transformed words as a single vector\n\nThis solution adheres to the special instructions provided and follows the general guidelines for Julia programming.","status":200,"tokens":[346,574],"elapsed":5.932529125,"cost":0.000804,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":22769,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
