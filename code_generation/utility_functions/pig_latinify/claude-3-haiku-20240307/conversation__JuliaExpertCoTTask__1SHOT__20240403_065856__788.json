The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Inside the function, we define a helper function `convert_to_pig_latin` that takes a single string and applies the Pig Latin transformation rules.\n3. We then use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word. The `@threads` macro ensures that each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread.\n4. Inside the loop, we update the original word in the `words` vector with the transformed Pig Latin version.\n5. Finally, we return the modified `words` vector.\n6. We check the correctness of the solution by calling `pig_latinify` with the provided example data.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Using a helper function to encapsulate the Pig Latin transformation logic.\n- Leveraging the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word.\n- Directly updating the original `words` vector to avoid creating a new copy.","status":200,"tokens":[174,561],"elapsed":5.447732083,"cost":0.0007447500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19936,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
