[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns the transformed pig latin version of the input words.\n2. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word using multiple threads. This ensures that the transformation of each word is done concurrently, improving the overall performance.\n3. Inside the `@threads` loop, the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is called for each word in the input vector. This function performs the actual transformation of a single word to pig latin.\n4. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function first checks if the word starts with a vowel (using a regular expression). If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the leading consonant(s) to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nThis solution should work for the given task and meet the requirements without the need for any additional special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[345,404],"elapsed":5.005265334,"cost":0.00059125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24909,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
