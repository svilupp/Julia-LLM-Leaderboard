[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input, and returns the same vector with each string transformed to its pig latin equivalent.\n\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, we use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string. This means that each string will be processed on a separate thread, improving the overall performance of the function.\n\n3. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function takes a single string `word` and returns its pig latin equivalent. It first checks if the word starts with a vowel, in which case it simply appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it finds the first non-vowel character, moves that character and all subsequent characters to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\".\n\n4. The `isvovel` function is a helper function that checks if a given character is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n\nThis solution should meet the requirements of the task, transforming a vector of strings to their pig latin equivalents, with each string processed on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[345,515],"elapsed":5.0923035,"cost":0.00073,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":13425,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
