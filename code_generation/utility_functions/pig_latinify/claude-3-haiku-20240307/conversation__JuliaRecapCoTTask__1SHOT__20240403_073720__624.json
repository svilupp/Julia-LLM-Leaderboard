[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of strings with each string transformed to its pig latin equivalent.\n2. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each string. This allows the transformation of each string to run concurrently on a separate thread, improving the overall performance of the function.\n3. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function is a helper function that takes a single string and converts it to its pig latin equivalent. It first checks if the first character of the word is a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the first character is a consonant, it moves all the consecutive consonants to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nThis solution follows the guidelines provided:\n\n- It uses the Julia standard library for parallelization (`Threads.@threads`) and avoids using any external packages.\n- It uses general type annotations (`<:AbstractString`) to allow the function to work with a wide range of string types.\n- It emphasizes performance, clarity, and abstract types, as requested.\n- It adheres to the reserved names in Julia and uses 1-based indexing.\n\nIf you have any special instructions, please provide them, and I'll update the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[346,546],"elapsed":5.70354425,"cost":0.000769,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
