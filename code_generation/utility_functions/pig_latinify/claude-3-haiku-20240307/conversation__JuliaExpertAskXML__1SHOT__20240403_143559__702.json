The `@sync` and `@async` macros are used to create and synchronize the parallel execution of the transformations.\n2. Each iteration runs on a separate thread, transforming the word according to the rules of Pig Latin.\n3. The function skips empty strings or strings that don't start with a letter.\n4. The transformed words are returned in the same order as the input vector.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"jump\", \"egg\", \"rhythm\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\n# pig_latinified is now [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"umjay\", \"eggway\", \"ythmray\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,359],"elapsed":3.92933675,"cost":0.00047375000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16201,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
