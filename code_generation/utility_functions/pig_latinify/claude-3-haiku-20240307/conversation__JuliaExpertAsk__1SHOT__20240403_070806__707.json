The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. The `convert_to_pig_latin` function, which is defined using the `@everywhere` macro, is the core logic for converting a single word to Pig Latin. It handles the cases where the word starts with a vowel or a consonant.\n3. The `@everywhere` macro ensures that the `convert_to_pig_latin` function is available on all worker processes.\n4. The `@sync @distributed for` loop iterates over the input vector of strings, applying the `convert_to_pig_latin` function to each word in parallel. The updated word is then assigned back to the original position in the input vector.\n5. Finally, the transformed vector of strings is returned.\n\nThe key aspects of this implementation are:\n- Parallel processing using the `@distributed` macro\n- Synchronization with the `@sync` macro to ensure all tasks complete before returning the result\n- Defining the core logic function using `@everywhere` to make it available on all worker processes\n\nThis solution is brief, concise, and leverages Julia's powerful parallel processing capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[95,502],"elapsed":5.578610083,"cost":0.00065125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16059,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
