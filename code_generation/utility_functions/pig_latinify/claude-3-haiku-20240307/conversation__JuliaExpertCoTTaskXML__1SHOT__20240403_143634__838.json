Define a `pig_latinify_word` function that takes a single word and converts it to pig latin.\n2. Implement the `pig_latinify` function that uses `@threads` to apply the `pig_latinify_word` function to each element of the input vector in parallel.\n3. Call the `pig_latinify` function with the example data and print the result.\n\nThis solution leverages Julia's built-in support for parallelism to speed up the transformation of the word list.","status":200,"tokens":[208,413],"elapsed":4.052150459,"cost":0.00056825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
