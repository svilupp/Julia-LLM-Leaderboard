I defined a function `transform_word` that takes a single word and transforms it to Pig Latin. This function is defined with the `@everywhere` macro so that it can be used by all worker processes.\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the Pig Latin versions of each word.\n3. Inside `pig_latinify`, I use a comprehension to create a vector of `@spawn` expressions, one for each word. This will run the `transform_word` function in a separate thread for each word.\n4. Finally, I collect the results from the `@spawn` expressions and return the transformed words.\n\nThis solution uses the built-in parallel processing capabilities of Julia to run the transformations on separate threads, which should make the overall operation faster.","status":200,"tokens":[174,554],"elapsed":5.398589,"cost":0.0007360000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-12577,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
