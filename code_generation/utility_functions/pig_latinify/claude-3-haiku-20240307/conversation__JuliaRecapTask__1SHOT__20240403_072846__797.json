[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the transformed vector.\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, we use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string. This allows us to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and improve the overall performance.\n3. For each string, we call the `transform_to_pig_latin` function, which handles the logic of converting the string to Pig Latin.\n4. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function first checks if the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y). If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n5. If the word doesn't start with a vowel, it finds the first uppercase letter in the word (if any) and moves the characters before that to the end, appending \"ay\".\n\nThis solution should work for the given task, and the use of threads should provide a performance boost, especially for larger input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[345,438],"elapsed":4.668270208,"cost":0.00063375,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7641,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
