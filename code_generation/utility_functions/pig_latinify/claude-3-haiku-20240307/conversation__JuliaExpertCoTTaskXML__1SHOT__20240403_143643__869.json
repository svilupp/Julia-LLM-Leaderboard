The `@everywhere` macro is used to define the `transform_word` function on all worker processes, ensuring that it can be called in parallel.\n\nThe `@distributed (append!)` loop iterates over the input vector of words and applies the `transform_word` function to each word, appending the transformed word to the output vector.\n\nThe `transform_word` function applies the pig latin transformation rules to each word:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel, it adds \"way\" to the end.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the leading consonant(s) to the end and adds \"ay\".\n3. If the word contains no vowels, it adds \"ay\" to the end.\n\nThe solution ensures that the transformation is performed in parallel, which can improve performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[208,471],"elapsed":4.856222375,"cost":0.00064075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11650,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
