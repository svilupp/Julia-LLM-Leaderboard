The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a new vector of strings with the Pig Latin equivalents.\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, we create a new vector `result` to store the transformed strings.\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process. The macro ensures that each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread.\n4. For each string in the `words` vector, we call the `transform_to_pig_latin` function, which performs the Pig Latin transformation on the individual string.\n5. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function first checks if the first character of the input word is a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n6. If the first character is not a vowel, the function searches for the first vowel in the word and moves the characters before the vowel to the end of the word, appending \"ay\".\n7. If no vowel is found, the function simply returns the original word.\n8. The transformed strings are then stored in the `result` vector, which is returned by the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nNote that the use of `Threads.@threads` assumes that your system has multiple CPU cores available to take advantage of parallel processing. If you're running on a system with a single CPU core, the parallelization will not provide any performance benefits.","status":200,"tokens":[58,658],"elapsed":6.655203834,"cost":0.0008370000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31880,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
