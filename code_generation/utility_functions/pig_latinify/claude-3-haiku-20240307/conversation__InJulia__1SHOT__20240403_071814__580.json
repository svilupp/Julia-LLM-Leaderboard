The function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. It uses the `@threaded` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string in the vector.\n3. For each string in the vector, it checks if the string is empty or if the first character is not a letter. If either of these conditions is true, it skips the transformation and moves on to the next string.\n4. If the first character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`), it appends \"way\" to the end of the string.\n5. If the first character is a consonant, it moves the consecutive consonants to the end of the string and appends \"ay\".\n6. The transformed strings are stored back in the original `words` vector.\n7. Finally, the function returns the modified `words` vector.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"isway\", \"awesomeway\"]\n```\n\nNote that the use of `@threaded` ensures that each string transformation is executed on a separate thread, which can improve performance on systems with multiple cores.","status":200,"tokens":[58,587],"elapsed":5.63679425,"cost":0.00074825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8514,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
