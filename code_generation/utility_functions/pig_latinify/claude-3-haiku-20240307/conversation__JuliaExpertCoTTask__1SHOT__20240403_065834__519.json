The `transform_word` function takes a single word and transforms it to Pig Latin. If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the first vowel index, moves the consonants to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function creates a new vector `transformed_words` with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n3. The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word. The `for` loop iterates over the `words` vector, and the `transform_word` function is called on each element, with the result stored in the `transformed_words` vector.\n\n4. Finally, the `transformed_words` vector is returned as the result.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro ensures that each word is processed on a separate thread, which can improve the performance of the transformation, especially for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[174,592],"elapsed":5.171836208,"cost":0.0007835000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2535,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
