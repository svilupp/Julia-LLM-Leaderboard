[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input.\n2. We use the `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the vector and transform it to Pig Latin using a separate thread for each iteration.\n3. Inside the loop, we find the index of the current word in the `words` vector using `findfirst(isequal(word), words)` and update the word at that index with the transformed Pig Latin version.\n4. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function handles the actual transformation of a single word to Pig Latin. It checks if the word starts with a vowel (using a regular expression) and either appends \"way\" to the end of the word or moves the initial consonants to the end and appends \"ay\".\n5. The function returns the transformed `words` vector.\n\nThe key aspects of this solution are:\n\n- Using the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each word, leveraging multiple CPU cores for improved performance.\n- Updating the `words` vector in-place to avoid creating a new vector, which would be less efficient.\n- Separating the Pig Latin transformation logic into a helper function `transform_to_pig_latin` for clarity and reusability.\n\nThis solution should work efficiently for transforming a vector of strings to Pig Latin, with each string being processed in a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[345,525],"elapsed":5.409221334,"cost":0.0007425,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9349,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
