It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process, running each iteration on a separate thread.\n\nThe `transform_to_pig_latin` function performs the actual Pig Latin transformation on a single word. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first consonant(s) to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(pig_latinified)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"applenay\", \"ananabay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,457],"elapsed":4.293951459,"cost":0.00059625,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17248,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
