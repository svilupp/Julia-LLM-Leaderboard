The `@everywhere` macro is used to define the `transform` function, which can be accessed across all worker processes.\n2. The `transform` function applies the Pig Latin rules to each input string.\n3. The `@sync` block ensures that all the asynchronous tasks (one for each input string) are completed before the function returns the transformed strings.\n4. The final result is a vector of transformed strings.\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's built-in support for parallel/concurrent processing to apply the Pig Latin transformation to each string in the input vector concurrently, improving performance.","status":200,"tokens":[100,309],"elapsed":4.179732958,"cost":0.00041125000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8720,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
