[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `is_vowel` function checks if a given character is a vowel.\n2. The `to_pig_latin` function takes a word and converts it to its pig latin equivalent. It handles the cases where the word starts with a vowel or a consonant.\n3. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of input strings and uses multithreading to transform each string to its pig latin counterpart.\n4. The `@everywhere` macro ensures that the `is_vowel` and `to_pig_latin` functions are defined on all worker processes.\n5. The `@sync` block ensures that all the asynchronous tasks (one for each input string) complete before the function returns the final result.\n6. The final result is a vector of pig latin strings, one for each input string.\n\nThe multithreading approach helps to parallelize the transformation of each string, potentially improving the overall performance of the function, especially for large input vectors.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if you need any clarification on the code.","status":200,"tokens":[346,523],"elapsed":5.111547375,"cost":0.00074025,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25407,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
