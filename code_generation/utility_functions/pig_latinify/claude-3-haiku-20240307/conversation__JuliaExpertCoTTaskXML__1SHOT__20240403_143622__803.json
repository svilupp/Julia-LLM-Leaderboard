The function checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the first vowel, moves the preceding consonants to the end, and appends \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function then uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of the vector of strings. It iterates over the vector, calling `convert_to_pig_latin` on each string, and updates the vector in place.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that the function correctly transforms the input vector of strings to their pig latin equivalents.","status":200,"tokens":[208,457],"elapsed":4.871541541,"cost":0.00062325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":24920,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
