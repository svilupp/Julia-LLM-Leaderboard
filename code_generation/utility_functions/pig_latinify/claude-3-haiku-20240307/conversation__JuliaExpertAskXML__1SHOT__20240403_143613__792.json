Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using the Julia language with the latest syntax:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if startswith(word, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y'])\n            words[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            first_letter = something(findnext(Bool, word, \"aeiouxy\", 1), 0)\n            words[i] = word[first_letter+1:end] * word[1:first_letter] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function, `pig_latinify`, takes a vector of strings as input and transforms each string to its Pig Latin equivalent. It uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the operations across multiple threads, ensuring efficient processing.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), the function adds \"way\" to the end of the word.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant, the function finds the first vowel position in the word, moves the leading consonants to the end, and adds \"ay\".\n3. The transformed words are stored back in the input vector, and the function returns the modified vector.\n\nNote that this solution assumes you have Julia version 1.6 or later, which supports the `@threads` macro for parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[100,359],"elapsed":4.049247834,"cost":0.00047375000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25461,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
