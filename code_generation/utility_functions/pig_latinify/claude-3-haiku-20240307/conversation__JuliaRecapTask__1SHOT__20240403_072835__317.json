[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of the same length with the strings transformed to pig latin.\n\n2. Inside `pig_latinify`, we create a new vector `results` to store the transformed strings.\n\n3. We use the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string. This macro ensures that each iteration of the loop runs on a separate thread.\n\n4. For each string in the input vector, we call the `transform_to_pig_latin` function, which performs the actual pig latin transformation, and store the result in the corresponding index of the `results` vector.\n\n5. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function takes a single string as input and returns the pig latin transformation of that string. It follows the standard pig latin rules:\n   - If the first character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), append \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the first character is a consonant, move all consecutive consonants to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n\n6. Finally, the `pig_latinify` function returns the `results` vector containing the transformed strings.\n\nThe example usage at the end shows how to call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of input strings and prints the resulting pig latinized strings.\n\nNote that this solution uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation of each string, which can provide a performance boost on systems with multiple cores. If you're running this on a system with a single core, the parallelization won't provide any additional benefit, and you can remove the `Threads.@threads` line and use a regular `for` loop instead.","status":200,"tokens":[345,694],"elapsed":6.646728791,"cost":0.0009537500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24804,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
