The transformations are performed in parallel using the `@threads` macro, which distributes the work across available threads.\n\nThe `transform_to_pig_latin` function checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nThis implementation is brief, concise, and leverages Julia's built-in support for parallelism to efficiently transform the input strings to their Pig Latin equivalents.","status":200,"tokens":[100,384],"elapsed":3.866585458,"cost":0.000505,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15078,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
