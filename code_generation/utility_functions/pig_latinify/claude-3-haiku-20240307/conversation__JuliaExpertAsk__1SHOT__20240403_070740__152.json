It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise solution using the `Threads` module in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        strings[i] = _pig_latinify(strings[i])\n    end\n    return strings\nend\n\nfunction _pig_latinify(word)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if startswith(word, vowels)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input, and it applies the pig latin transformation to each string using a separate thread. The `_pig_latinify` function is a helper function that performs the transformation on a single word.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation across the vector of strings.\n2. The `_pig_latinify` function checks if the word starts with a vowel. If so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n3. If the word doesn't start with a vowel, it finds the first vowel and moves the consonants at the beginning of the word to the end, appending \"ay\".\n4. The transformed strings are updated in-place within the `pig_latinify` function and returned.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input vector of strings is not empty.","status":200,"tokens":[95,373],"elapsed":3.498038625,"cost":0.00049,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-25488,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
