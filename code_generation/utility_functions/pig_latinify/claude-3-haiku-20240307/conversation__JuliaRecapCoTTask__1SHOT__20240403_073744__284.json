[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function that operates on a single string is defined first. It checks if the word starts with a vowel, and if so, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If the word starts with a consonant, it finds the first vowel index, and moves the consonants to the end of the word, appending \"ay\".\n\n2. The main `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings is defined next. It first makes the `pig_latinify` function available to all worker processes using `@everywhere`.\n\n3. If the `{{addworkers}}` instruction is provided, it adds the specified number of workers to the Julia cluster.\n\n4. The function then uses a list comprehension with `@spawn` to transform each string in the input vector to pig latin in parallel, and returns the resulting array of Future objects.\n\nThe code is designed to be flexible and efficient, using Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities to parallelize the string transformations. It also follows the guidelines provided, using Julia's standard library functions and avoiding the use of external packages unless explicitly requested.","status":200,"tokens":[346,590],"elapsed":5.99796225,"cost":0.0008240000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31500,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
