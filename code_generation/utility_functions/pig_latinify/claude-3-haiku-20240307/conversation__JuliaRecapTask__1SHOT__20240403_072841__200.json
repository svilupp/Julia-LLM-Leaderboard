[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `to_pig_latin` function is defined inside the `pig_latinify` function. This function takes a single word as input and applies the pig latin transformation rules:\n   - If the word starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, it moves the first consonant cluster to the end and appends \"ay\".\n   - If no vowel is found, it returns the original word.\n\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n3. It creates a new vector `transformed_words` with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n4. The `@threads` macro is used to iterate over the `words` vector and transform each word in parallel. The transformed words are stored in the `transformed_words` vector.\n5. Finally, the `transformed_words` vector is returned.\n\nThis solution uses Julia's built-in support for parallel processing to speed up the transformation. The `@threads` macro automatically distributes the work across available threads, allowing the transformation to be performed concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[345,589],"elapsed":6.05489325,"cost":0.0008225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2765,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
