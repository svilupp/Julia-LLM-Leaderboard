Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia, using the `Threads` module to parallelize the transformations:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = first(word)\n        if first_letter ∈ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            words[i] = \"$word\"*\"way\"\n        else\n            consonants = takewhile(c -> c ∉ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], word)\n            words[i] = \"$word[length(consonants)+1:end]$consonants\"*\"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word in the input vector.\n2. For each word, the function checks if the first letter is a vowel. If it is, the word is transformed by appending \"way\" to the end.\n3. If the first letter is a consonant, the function identifies the leading consonant cluster and moves it to the end of the word, appending \"ay\".\n4. The modified words are stored back in the original vector, which is returned.\n\nThis implementation takes advantage of Julia's built-in support for parallel processing, allowing the pig latin transformation to be performed efficiently on large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[100,357],"elapsed":3.950674333,"cost":0.00047125000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28768,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
