I define a helper function `transform_word` that takes a single word and applies the pig latin rules to it. This is marked as `@everywhere` so it can be used by all worker processes.\n2. I then use the `@sync` and `@async` macros to iterate over the input words and transform each one on a separate thread.\n3. Finally, I collect the transformed words into a new vector and return it.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Defining the helper function\n2. Using `@sync` and `@async` to parallelize the transformations\n3. Collecting the results into a new vector\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[208,391],"elapsed":4.121548625,"cost":0.00054075,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25647,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
