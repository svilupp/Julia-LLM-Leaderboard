The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `words` as input and returns a new vector of strings with each word transformed to its Pig Latin equivalent.\n\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, a new vector `result` is created with the same length as the input `words` vector.\n\n3. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the transformation of each word to Pig Latin. The `for` loop iterates over the `words` vector, and for each iteration, the `transform_to_pig_latin` function is called to convert the word to its Pig Latin equivalent, and the result is stored in the `result` vector.\n\n4. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function takes a single string `word` as input and returns its Pig Latin equivalent.\n\n   - If the word starts with a vowel (determined by the `vowel_regex` regular expression), the function appends \"way\" to the end of the word.\n   - If the word starts with a consonant, the function finds the first vowel in the word, moves the consonants before the vowel to the end of the word, and appends \"ay\".\n   - If the word contains no vowels, it is returned as-is.\n\n5. The `const vowel_regex` variable is defined to hold the regular expression pattern for matching vowels.\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, simply call it with a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"programming\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\n# pig_latin_words == [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliajay\", \"ogrammingpray\"]\n```\n\nThe function will use multiple threads to transform each word to its Pig Latin equivalent, which can improve performance for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[58,660],"elapsed":6.211113125,"cost":0.0008395000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22993,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
