Here's a simple and concise way to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.value.(Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `format` function from the `Dates` module to convert each `DateTime` in the `dt` column to a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The `value` function is then used to convert these strings back into integers. The result is stored in a new column `ym` in the dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[244,230],"elapsed":6.006347709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":736822242,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
