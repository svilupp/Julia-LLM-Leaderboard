Here's a simple way to do it using the DataFrames and Dates packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Ensure that the dt column is of type DateTime\n    @assert all(isa.(df.dt, DateTime))\n\n    # Extract year and month from dt and format as \"yyyymm\"\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks that all elements in the `dt` column are of type `DateTime`. Then, it uses the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package to extract the year and month from each `DateTime`. It multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to get the \"yyyymm\" format as an integer. The result is stored in a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[75,247],"elapsed":8.658522,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1689729173,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
