Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. We'll use the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages for this task.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Ensure that the dt column is of type DateTime\n    df.dt = DateTime.(df.dt)\n\n    # Extract year and month from the dt column\n    y = Year.(df.dt)\n    m = month.(df.dt)\n\n    # Convert year and month to integers and format them as \"yyyymm\"\n    ym = @. string(y, lpad(string(m), 2, '0'))\n\n    # Convert ym to integer\n    ym = parse.(Int, ym)\n\n    # Add the new ym column to the DataFrame\n    df.ym = ym\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first ensures that the `dt` column is of type `DateTime`. Then it extracts the year and month from `dt`, formats them as \"yyyymm\", and converts the result to an integer. Finally, it adds the new `ym` column to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[75,296],"elapsed":8.054678792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-425337251,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
