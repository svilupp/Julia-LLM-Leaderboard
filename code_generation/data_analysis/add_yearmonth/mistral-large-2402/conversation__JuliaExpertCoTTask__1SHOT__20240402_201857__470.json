The `ym` column is created by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, converting them to integers, concatenating them together in the format \"yyyymm\", and then assigning the result back to the `ym` column of the `df` DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can use this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(new_df)\n```\n\nThis will print the new DataFrame with the `ym` column added.","status":200,"tokens":[244,287],"elapsed":7.756968083,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1151519149,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
