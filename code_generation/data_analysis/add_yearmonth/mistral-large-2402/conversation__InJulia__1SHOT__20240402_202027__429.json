Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that. In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to work with dates and times. Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `.` before the functions `year` and `month` is used to apply these functions to each element of the `dt` column. The `.*` and `.+` are broadcasting operators, which apply the multiplication and addition operations element-wise.\n\nIn this case, we multiply the year by 100 and add the month to get the \"yyyymm\" format as an integer. Please ensure that the `dt` column is of `DateTime` type for this function to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[75,248],"elapsed":6.136384,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1055636403,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
