The format string \"yyyymm\" specifies that we want to extract the year and month as a single string of digits. The `parse` function is then used to convert this string to a DateTime object, and `Int` is used to convert this to an integer. The result is stored in a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[244,244],"elapsed":5.546411916,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1765570543,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
