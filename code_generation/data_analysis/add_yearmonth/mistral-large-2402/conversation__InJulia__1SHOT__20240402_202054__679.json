Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages, so make sure you have those installed and imported.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Ensure that the dt column exists in the DataFrame\n    if !haskey(df, :dt)\n        error(\"The DataFrame does not contain a column named :dt\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract year and month from the dt column\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `dt` column exists in the DataFrame. If it does, it creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, converting them to integers, and concatenating them in the \"yyyymm\" format. The function then returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[75,254],"elapsed":6.053540291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-740555581,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
