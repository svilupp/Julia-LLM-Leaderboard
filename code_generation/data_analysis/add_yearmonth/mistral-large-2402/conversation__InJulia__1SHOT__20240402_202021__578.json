This function uses the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages, so make sure you have those installed and imported in your Julia environment.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Ensure the dt column is of type DateTime\n    df.dt = Dates.DateTime.(df.dt)\n\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    year = Dates.year.(df.dt)\n    month = Dates.month.(df.dt)\n\n    # Concatenate year and month into a new column ym\n    df.ym = @. string(year, lpad(string(month), 2, '0'))\n\n    # Convert ym column to integer\n    df.ym = parse.(Int, df.ym)\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first ensures that the `dt` column is of type `DateTime`. It then extracts the year and month from the `dt` column, concatenates them together into a string in the format \"yyyymm\", and stores this new column in the DataFrame as `ym`. Finally, it converts the `ym` column to integers.","status":200,"tokens":[75,294],"elapsed":6.930242709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-409512323,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
