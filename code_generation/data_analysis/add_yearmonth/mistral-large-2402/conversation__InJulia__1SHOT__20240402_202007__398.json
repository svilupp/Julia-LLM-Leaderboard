In Julia, you can use the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages to accomplish this. Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `ym` column is created by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, converting them to integers, concatenating them together in the format \"yyyymm\", and then assigning this new series back to the DataFrame.\n\nThe `.*` and `.+` operators are used to ensure that the operations are performed element-wise on the vectors returned by `Dates.year.(df.dt)` and `Dates.month.(df.dt)`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,247],"elapsed":6.455568875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1973414528,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
