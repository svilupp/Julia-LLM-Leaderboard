Here's a simple and concise way to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by extracting the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column, multiplying the year by 100, and adding the month. This results in an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can use this function with your provided DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe `new_df` DataFrame will now have a new column `ym` with the year and month from `dt` in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[244,273],"elapsed":6.852465958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1928681191,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
