Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.value.(Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n\n1. Formatting the DateTime values in the `dt` column of the DataFrame `df` into the \"yyyymm\" format using the `Dates.format` function. This returns a vector of strings.\n2. Converting these strings into integers using the `Dates.value` function. This function is used because it can convert a string representation of a date or time into an integer, which is what we want in this case.\n3. Assigning these integers to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.\n4. Returning the modified DataFrame.\n\nWhen you call `add_yearmonth(df)` with the provided DataFrame `df`, it will add a new column `ym` to `df` with the year and month from `dt` concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[244,337],"elapsed":9.702594708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-380580191,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
