In Julia, you can use the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages to accomplish this. Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.value.(Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using the `format` function from the `Dates` package to convert each `DateTime` in the `dt` column to a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The `value` function is then used to convert these strings back into integers. The result is stored in a new column `ym` in the dataframe `df`.\n\nPlease ensure that the `dt` column is of `DateTime` type for this function to work correctly. If it's not, you might need to convert it first using `Dates.DateTime(df.dt)`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,235],"elapsed":7.267358416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-228688680,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
