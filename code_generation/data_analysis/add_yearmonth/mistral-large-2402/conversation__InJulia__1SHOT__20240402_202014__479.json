Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the `Dates` and `DataFrames` packages, so make sure you have those installed.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Ensure that the dt column is of type DateTime\n    @assert all(isa.(df.dt, DateTime))\n\n    # Extract year and month from dt and format as \"yyyymm\"\n    ym = Dates.format.(yearmonth.(df.dt), \"yyyymm\")\n\n    # Convert ym to integer\n    ym = parse.(Int, ym)\n\n    # Add ym as a new column to df\n    df.ym = ym\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if all elements in the `dt` column are of type `DateTime`. Then it extracts the year and month from each `DateTime` object in `dt` using the `yearmonth` function. The `format` function is used to format the year and month as a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting string is then parsed into an integer. Finally, the new `ym` column is added to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[75,296],"elapsed":6.588008583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2079101387,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
