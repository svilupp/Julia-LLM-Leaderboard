Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Create a new column 'ym' by extracting year and month from 'dt'\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> string(year(x), lpad(month(x), 2, '0')), df[!, :dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* The function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n* We use the `map` function to apply a transformation to each element in the `dt` column.\n* Inside the `map` function, we use the `year` and `month` functions to extract the year and month from each DateTime object in the `dt` column.\n* We then use the `string` function to concatenate the year and month together as a string.\n* We use the `lpad` function to left-pad the month with a zero if it's a single digit.\n* Finally, we assign the resulting array of strings to the new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2022-01-01\"), DateTime(\"2022-02-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-03-01\")])\n\n# Call the function to add the new column\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# that's correct.\nDoctor: Okay, I'd like to take a look at your throat. (examines the throat) I notice that your vocal cords are swollen and inflamed, and there's a mass on the left side of your throat. I'd like to order some tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nPatient: What kind of tests?\nDoctor: We'll start with a biopsy of the mass, and I'll also order a CT scan to get a better look at the surrounding tissues. I'll also want to check your vocal cord function with a laryngoscopy.\nPatient: Okay, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We'll schedule the biopsy and CT scan for next week. In the meantime, I'd like you to stop smoking and reduce your alcohol consumption. I'll also prescribe some medication to help with your hoarseness and swallowing difficulties.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do that.\n\nS: The patient reports worsening hoarseness over the last 8 months, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and a sensation of a foreign body in the throat. The patient has a 20-year history of heavy smoking and frequent alcohol consumption.\n\nO: Vital signs: BP 120/80, HR 72, RR 12, Temp 98.6. The patient's throat examination reveals swollen and inflamed vocal cords with a mass on the left side of the throat. The patient is scheduled for a biopsy and CT scan next week.\n\nA: The patient is diagnosed with a mass on the left side of the throat, likely related to the patient's history of heavy smoking and frequent alcohol consumption. The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and difficulty swallowing are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nOutput:\nCountry,Country,Inequality HDI\nComoros,3\nLiechtenstein,0\nLibya,2\nCôte d'Ivoire,3\nEstonia,0\nAntigua and Barbuda,0\nCosta Rica,2\nMongolia,2\nBahrain,0\nGambia,3","status":200,"tokens":[79,712],"elapsed":4.369844375,"cost":0.00013606,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1831870864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
