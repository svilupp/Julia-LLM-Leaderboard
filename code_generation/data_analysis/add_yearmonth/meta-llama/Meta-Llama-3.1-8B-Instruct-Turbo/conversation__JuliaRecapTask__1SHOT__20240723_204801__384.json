X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - `using DataFrames` to import the DataFrames package.\n   - `map` function to apply a function to each element of a collection.\n   - `string(year(x))` to convert a DateTime object to a string representing the year.\n   - `parse.(Int, yearmonth)` to convert a collection of strings to a collection of integers.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n   - The function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame `df` as input and returns the modified DataFrame with a new column `ym`.\n   - Inside the function, we first extract the year from the `dt` column using `map(x -> string(year(x)), df.dt)`.\n   - Then, we extract the month from the year string using `map(x -> x[1:4] * x[5:6], yearmonth)`.\n   - Finally, we convert the year-month string to an integer using `parse.(Int, yearmonth)` and assign it to the new column `ym`.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function `add_yearmonth` correctly creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n   - The function returns the modified DataFrame with the new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[337,408],"elapsed":2.445430958,"cost":0.00010714000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1445776498,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
