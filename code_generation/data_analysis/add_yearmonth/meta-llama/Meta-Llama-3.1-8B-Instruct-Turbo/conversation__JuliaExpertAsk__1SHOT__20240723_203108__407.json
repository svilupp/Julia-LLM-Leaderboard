The transformation uses the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each DateTime, and then concatenates them together as a string. The `lpad` function is used to pad the month with a leading zero if necessary. The resulting string is then assigned to a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[114,149],"elapsed":1.029891167,"cost":3.8219999999999997e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1590805696,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
