Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a concise and high-quality solution:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(dt -> year(dt) * 100 + month(dt), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `map` function to apply the transformation to each element in the `dt` column. The `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package are used to extract the year and month from each DateTime object. The resulting year and month are then concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month.\n\nNote that the function modifies the original DataFrame `df` by adding a new column `ym`. If you want to preserve the original DataFrame and return a new one, you can modify the function to return a new DataFrame instead:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    return hcat(df, DataFrame(ym = map(dt -> year(dt) * 100 + month(dt), df.dt)))\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[114,229],"elapsed":5.248383708,"cost":0.004005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":687140936,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
