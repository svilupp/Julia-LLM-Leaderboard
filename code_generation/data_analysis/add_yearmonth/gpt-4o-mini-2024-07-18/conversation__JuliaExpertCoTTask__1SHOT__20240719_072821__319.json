Define the function `add_yearmonth`.\n2. Extract the year and month from the `dt` column and format them as “yyyymm”.\n3. Add this new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n4. Ensure that the solution is correct by checking the output.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = (year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt))  # Concatenate year and month as integer\n    return df  # Return the modified DataFrame\nend\n\n# Data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Solve the task\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Check the solution\nprintln(df_with_ym)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The `year.(df.dt)` obtains the year values, and `month.(df.dt)` obtains the month values for each row.\n2. We use element-wise operations to compute the new `ym` column as `year * 100 + month`, which gives the format `yyyymm`.\n3. The modified DataFrame is returned and printed for verification. \n\nNow let's run this code to see the output:\n\n```julia\n# Output Check\nprintln(df_with_ym)\n``` \n\nThe output should show the original DateTime and the new `ym` column with the correct format.","status":200,"tokens":[216,352],"elapsed":5.139456458,"cost":0.00024359999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1504691511,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
