Inside this function, we'll create a new column, `ym`, by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, formatting it as \"yyyymm\", and converting it to an integer.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code needed**: We'll use the `DataFrame` from the Julia `DataFrames` package, and the `DateTime` type from Julia's `Dates` module.\n\n3. **Solve the task**: I'll implement the function.\n\n4. **Check that the solution is correct**: I'll apply the function to the provided data and print the resulting DataFrame.\n\nNow, here's the Julia code for the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\n# Function to add yearmonth column\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Int.(df.dt .|> (dt -> year(dt) * 100 + month(dt)))  # Extract year and month, concatenate\n    return df\nend\n\n# Data setup\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Apply the function\nresult_df = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Display the result\nprintln(result_df)\n```\n\n### Checking the solution:\nWhen I run the above code, the resulting DataFrame should show the original `dt` column as well as the new `ym` column. Let's break down the results manually:\n\n- For `DateTime(2020, 5, 24)`: `ym` should be `202005`\n- For `DateTime(2021, 1, 15)`: `ym` should be `202101`\n- For `DateTime(2022, 12, 5)`: `ym` should be `202212`\n\nThe final DataFrame should look like this:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt                   ym\n─────┼──────────────────────────\n   1 │ 2020-05-24 00:00:00    202005\n   2 │ 2021-01-15 00:00:00    202101\n   3 │ 2022-12-05 00:00:00    202212\n```\n\nThis confirms that the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[216,531],"elapsed":7.389426667,"cost":0.00035099999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1056878641,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
