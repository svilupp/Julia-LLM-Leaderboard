Here's a concise implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = (YearMonth.(df.dt) .|> (ym -> year(ym) * 100 + month(ym)))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nMake sure to install the required packages if you haven't done so:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTime values. It creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month and concatenating them in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[109,154],"elapsed":2.092003625,"cost":0.00010874999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-238116726,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
