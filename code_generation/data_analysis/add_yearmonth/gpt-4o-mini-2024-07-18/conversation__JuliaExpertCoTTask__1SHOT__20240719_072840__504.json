Import the necessary Julia packages.\n2. Define the function `add_yearmonth` which takes a DataFrame.\n3. Inside the function, extract the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column.\n4. Concatenate the year and month into the format “yyyymm”.\n5. Add the new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n6. Return the modified DataFrame.\n\nNow, let's implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\n# Function to add year-month column\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example Data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Solve the task\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Check that the solution is correct\nprintln(df_with_ym)\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n1. We import `DataFrames` and `Dates` for data manipulation and handling DateTime types.\n2. `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and computes a new column `ym` by iterating through each DateTime, extracting the year and month, and combining them in the specified format.\n3. The modified DataFrame is returned.\n\n**Checking the Solution:**\nPrinting `df_with_ym` will show the original `dt` column and the newly created `ym` column, verifying that our solution is correct. \n\nLet's run the function on the provided data now.","status":200,"tokens":[216,385],"elapsed":4.897149791,"cost":0.0002634,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-381971166,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
