Define the function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input.\n2. Extract the year and month from the `dt` column.\n3. Concatenate them in the format \"yyyymm\" as an integer.\n4. Create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame to store this integer value.\n5. Return the modified DataFrame.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = (year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt))\n    return df\nend\n\n# Data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n# Solve the task\nresult_df = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Check that the solution is correct\nprintln(result_df)\n```\n\nNow let's explain the code components:\n\n- `year.(df.dt)` extracts the year from each DateTime object in the `dt` column.\n- `month.(df.dt)` extracts the month.\n- The expression `(year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt))` combines them into the desired format \"yyyymm\".\n- We assign this new integer value to a new column `ym` in the original DataFrame.\n\nFinally, the solution is confirmed to be correct by printing the `result_df`, which should include the new column with the expected values.","status":200,"tokens":[216,323],"elapsed":3.810856666,"cost":0.0002262,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1690960105,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
