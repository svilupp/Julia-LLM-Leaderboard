Here's how you can implement the `add_yearmonth` function using the Julia programming language with the DataFrames and Dates packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym .= yearmonth.(df.dt)  # Create a new column 'ym' from 'dt'\nend\n\n# Usage example:\n# df = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2021, 5, 15), DateTime(2022, 3, 10)])\n# add_yearmonth!(df)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define the function `add_yearmonth!` which modifies the DataFrame `df` in place.\n- We use the `yearmonth` function from the `Dates` module that gives the year and month as a `YearMonth` type which implicitly converts to an integer format `yyyymm`.\n- The `.=` operator ensures that we are broadcasting the operation across the entire column.","status":200,"tokens":[109,222],"elapsed":2.962748333,"cost":0.00014954999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-706517509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
