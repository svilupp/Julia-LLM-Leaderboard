Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise solution to add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt) * 100 .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We assume that the DataFrame `df` has a column named `dt` of type `DateTime`.\n2. The function `add_yearmonth` takes the DataFrame `df` as input.\n3. We create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame using the dot notation `df.ym`.\n4. To extract the year from each `DateTime` value in `df.dt`, we use the `year` function and broadcast it over the column using the dot notation `year.(df.dt)`. This returns an array of years.\n5. Similarly, we extract the month from each `DateTime` value using `month.(df.dt)`, which returns an array of months.\n6. To concatenate the year and month together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", we multiply the years by 100 and add the months. This effectively shifts the years to the left by two decimal places and adds the months to the rightmost two digits.\n7. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df` with the new `ym` column added.\n\nThe resulting `ym` column will contain integers representing the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\". For example, if a row in `df.dt` has a value of `2023-06-15T00:00:00`, the corresponding value in `df.ym` will be `202306`.","status":200,"tokens":[115,412],"elapsed":17.106947167,"cost":0.032624999999999994,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-3879,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
