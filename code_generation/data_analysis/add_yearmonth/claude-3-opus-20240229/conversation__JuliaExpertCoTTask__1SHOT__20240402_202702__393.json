The function takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. It creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame by:\n   - Extracting the year from the `dt` column using the `year` function and multiplying it by 100.\n   - Extracting the month from the `dt` column using the `month` function.\n   - Adding the year and month together to get the desired \"yyyymm\" format as an integer.\n3. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nUsing the provided data:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt                  ym     \n     │ DateTime            Int64  \n─────┼─────────────────────────────\n   1 │ 2020-05-24T00:00:00  202005\n   2 │ 2021-01-15T00:00:00  202101\n   3 │ 2022-12-05T00:00:00  202212\n```\n\nThe function has added a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with the year and month extracted from `dt` in the desired format.\n\nLet's verify the correctness:\n\n- For the first row, `dt` is \"2020-05-24\", so `ym` should be 202005, which is correct.\n- For the second row, `dt` is \"2021-01-15\", so `ym` should be 202101, which is correct.\n- For the third row, `dt` is \"2022-12-05\", so `ym` should be 202212, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the `add_yearmonth` function correctly solves the given task.","status":200,"tokens":[225,528],"elapsed":19.084583541,"cost":0.042975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27130,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
