Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function to add a new `ym` column to the DataFrame by extracting year and month from the `dt` column:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    df[!, :ym] = 100 * year.(df[!, :dt]) + month.(df[!, :dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month components from the `dt` column respectively.\n2. We multiply the year by 100 and add the month to create the `yyyymm` format as an integer.\n3. We assign the result to a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame using the `df[!, :ym]` syntax.\n4. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame.\n\nLet's test it with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt                  ym     \n     │ DateTime            Int64  \n─────┼────────────────────────────\n   1 │ 2020-05-24T00:00:00 202005\n   2 │ 2021-01-15T00:00:00 202101\n   3 │ 2022-12-05T00:00:00 202212\n```\n\nAs we can see, the new `ym` column is added to the DataFrame with the year and month concatenated as an integer in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[225,422],"elapsed":19.585633708,"cost":0.035025,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24073,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
