Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `add_yearmonth` that adds a new column `ym` to the given DataFrame `df` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    year = Dates.year.(df.dt)\n    month = Dates.month.(df.dt)\n\n    # Concatenate year and month as integer in format: yyyymm\n    df.ym = year * 100 .+ month\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It uses `Dates.year.(df.dt)` to extract the year from each element in the `dt` column and stores it in the `year` variable.\n\n2. Similarly, it uses `Dates.month.(df.dt)` to extract the month from each element in the `dt` column and stores it in the `month` variable.\n\n3. It creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` by concatenating the `year` and `month` values. The concatenation is done by multiplying the `year` by 100 and adding the `month` to it using the broadcasting operation `.+`.\n\n4. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame `df` with the new `ym` column added.\n\nThe resulting `ym` column will contain integers representing the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\". For example, if a row in `dt` has a value of `2023-06-15`, the corresponding value in the `ym` column will be `202306`.\n\nNote: Make sure to have the `Dates` module imported before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[115,404],"elapsed":16.961937125,"cost":0.032025,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
