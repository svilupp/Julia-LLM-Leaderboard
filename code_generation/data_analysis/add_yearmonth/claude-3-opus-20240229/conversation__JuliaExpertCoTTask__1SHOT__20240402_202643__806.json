It uses `map` to iterate over each row of the DataFrame `df`\n2. For each row, it extracts the year from `dt` using `year()` and multiplies it by 100\n3. It extracts the month from `dt` using `month()` and adds it to the year part\n4. This creates an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" for each row\n5. The result is assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame\n6. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned\n\nThe output shows that the `add_yearmonth` function correctly creates a new column `ym` with the year and month extracted from `dt` in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[225,411],"elapsed":17.019206041,"cost":0.0342,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8951,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
