Inside the function, we use `map` to apply a function to each element of the `dt` column of `df`. The function we apply is `parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"))`, which formats the DateTime `x` as \"yyyymm\" and then parses the result as an integer. The result of the map operation is assigned to the new column `ym` of `df`. \n\nThe function then returns the modified DataFrame. \n\nFinally, we call `add_yearmonth` on the DataFrame `df` that we created.","status":200,"tokens":[239,280],"elapsed":17.773047917,"cost":0.00011186,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1287792925,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
