The `* 100` is used to shift the year two places to the left to make space for the month, which is then added to the year. This gives the year and month concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The result is assigned to the new `ym` column in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[116,168],"elapsed":11.053427291,"cost":6.328e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-69102085,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
