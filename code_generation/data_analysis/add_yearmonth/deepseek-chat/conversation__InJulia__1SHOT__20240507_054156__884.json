Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column and concatenate them\n    df.ym = (year.(df.dt) .* 100) .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, extracts the year and month from the `dt` column using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package, and concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The result is stored in a new column `ym` in the DataFrame. The modified DataFrame is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[77,201],"elapsed":12.873087458,"cost":6.706e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-24118592,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
