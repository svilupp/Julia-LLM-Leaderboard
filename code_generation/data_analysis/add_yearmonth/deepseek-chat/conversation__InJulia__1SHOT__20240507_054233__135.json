Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that achieves what you're asking for. The function uses the `Dates` module to extract year and month from the DateTime column and then concatenates them to form a new column `ym`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ Dates.month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `Dates.year.(df.dt)` and `Dates.month.(df.dt)` are broadcasting operations that apply `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` respectively to each element of `df.dt`. The results are then multiplied by 100 and added together to form the `ym` column.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2020, 1, 1), DateTime(2020, 2, 1)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will add a column `ym` to `df` with values `202001` and `202002` for the two rows.","status":200,"tokens":[77,275],"elapsed":17.435546667,"cost":8.778e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1851792217,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
