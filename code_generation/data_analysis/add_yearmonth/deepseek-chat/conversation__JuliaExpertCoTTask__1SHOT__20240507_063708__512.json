These are then concatenated together as strings, with \"00\" added in between to ensure that the resulting string is always six characters long (even for months less than 10). The string is then parsed back into an integer and added as a new column \"ym\" to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[239,224],"elapsed":14.95729025,"cost":9.618000000000002e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1338434672,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
