Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using string formatting and applying it to each row in the DataFrame. Here is a solution using the Pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].dt.year.astype(str) + df['dt'].dt.month.astype(str).str.zfill(2)\n    df['ym'] = df['ym'].astype(int)\n    return df\n```\n\nThis function uses the `.dt.year` and `.dt.month` methods to extract the year and month from the 'dt' column, respectively. The `.astype(str)` method is used to convert these to strings, and the `.str.zfill(2)` method is used to ensure that the month is always two digits. The year and month are then concatenated together with a simple string concatenation operation. Finally, the `.astype(int)` method is used to convert the resulting string to an integer.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'dt': pd.to_datetime(['2020-01-01', '2020-02-01', '2021-03-01'])})\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n                 dt    ym\n0 2020-01-01 00:00:00  202001\n1 2020-02-01 00:00:00  202002\n2 2021-03-01 00:00:00  202103\n```","status":200,"tokens":[116,407],"elapsed":24.212185084,"cost":0.00013020000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":759310938,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
