This lambda function is extracting year and month from each DateTime object, multiplying year by 100 to always keep month in the tens place, and adding months to it. The result is a concatenated representation of year and month in the format \"yyymm\". \n\nRemember to replace 'dt' and 'ym' with your actual column names if they are different. \n\nNote: This function assumes that `df['dt']` contains `datetime64` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[116,193],"elapsed":11.806533875,"cost":7.028000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-665888405,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
