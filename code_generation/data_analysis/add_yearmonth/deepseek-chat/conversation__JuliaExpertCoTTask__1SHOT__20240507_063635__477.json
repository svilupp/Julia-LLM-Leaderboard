It then defines a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input. Inside the function, it creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nThe last two lines create a DataFrame `df` with some example data, and applies the `add_yearmonth` function to it.","status":200,"tokens":[239,266],"elapsed":17.156751458,"cost":0.00010794,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-660566417,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
