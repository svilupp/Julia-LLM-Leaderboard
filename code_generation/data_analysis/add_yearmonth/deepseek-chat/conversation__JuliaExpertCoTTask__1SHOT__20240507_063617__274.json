We then create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame by using the `Dates.format` function to format the `dt` column as \"yyyy-mm\", and then converting the resulting string to an integer using `parse(Int)`. The modified DataFrame is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[239,209],"elapsed":13.205682458,"cost":9.198e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":68344776,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
