Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `month` and `year` methods from the `Dates` module in Julia to extract the month and year from a DateTime object, and then concatenate them together to create a new integer. Here's how you can write the function `add_yearmonth`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = (year.(df.dt) .* 100) .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function modifies the DataFrame `df` in-place by creating a new column `ym` and populating it with the year and month concatenated together as integers. The expression `(year.(df.dt) .* 100) .+ month.(df.dt)` extracts the year and month using broadcasting (`.` operator with functions), multiplies the year by 100 to ensure it occupies the higher order digits, and then adds the month to get the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column contains valid DateTime objects. If the `dt` column contains missing values or values that are not DateTime objects, you may need to handle those cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[116,266],"elapsed":16.644024292,"cost":9.072e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-86312095,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
