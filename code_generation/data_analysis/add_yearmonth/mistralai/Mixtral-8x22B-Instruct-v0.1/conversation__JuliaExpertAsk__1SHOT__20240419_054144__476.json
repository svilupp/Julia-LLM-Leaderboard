Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a brief and concise function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt) .|> x -> parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `yearmonth` function from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column. It then formats these as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format and parses them as an integer. The result is stored in a new column `ym`.\n\nPlease ensure that the `df.dt` column is of `DateTime` type before applying this function. If it's not, you may need to convert it to `DateTime` type first.\n\nAlso, please note that the `|>` operator is used for piping, which is a way to chain together multiple operations. The `.` before `|>` is used for broadcasting, which applies the operation to each element in the array.","status":200,"tokens":[126,258],"elapsed":8.80293175,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":375511551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
