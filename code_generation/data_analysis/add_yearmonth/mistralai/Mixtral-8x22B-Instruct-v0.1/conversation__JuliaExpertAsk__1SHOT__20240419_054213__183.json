The `.|>` operator is used to apply the anonymous function `ym -> ym.value` to each element in the resulting array, which extracts the integer value of the year and month concatenated together in the format \"yyyymm\". The result is then assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[126,186],"elapsed":16.527731542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-911512361,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
