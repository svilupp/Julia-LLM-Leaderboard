It then converts each year-month pair into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `format` function, and finally parses each string as an integer. The result is a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[126,177],"elapsed":4.607490333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1323547962,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
