Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a brief and concise function that should do the job:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt) .|> x -> parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `yearmonth` function from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column. It then formats these as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format and parses them as an integer. The result is stored in a new column `ym`.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies the input DataFrame `df` in-place and returns it for convenience. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should make a copy of it before calling this function.\n\nAlso, this function assumes that the `dt` column contains `DateTime` objects. If it contains strings or other types, you may need to convert them to `DateTime` first.","status":200,"tokens":[126,246],"elapsed":6.21576675,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-2134197450,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
