[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\") .|> x -> parse(Int, x)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `format` function from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column and format it as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format. Then it uses a dot-pipe (`.|>`) to apply the `parse` function to each element in the resulting array, converting the strings to integers. The result is assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.\n\nPlease make sure to have the `DataFrames` and `Dates` packages loaded in your Julia environment before running this function. You can do this by adding `using DataFrames` and `using Dates` at the beginning of your script.\n\nAlso, please note that this function modifies the DataFrame `df` in-place and returns it. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should make a copy of it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[84,286],"elapsed":4.166886125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":839980269,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
