[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyyMM\") .|> x -> parse(Int, x)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `format` function from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column and format it as a string in the \"yyyyMM\" format. Then it uses a comprehension to parse each string as an integer and assign the result to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.\n\nPlease make sure to have the `DataFrames` and `Dates` packages installed and loaded in your Julia environment before running this function. You can install them using the package manager by running `]add DataFrames Dates` in the Julia REPL.\n\nAlso, please note that this function modifies the input DataFrame `df` in-place and returns the modified DataFrame. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you can create a copy of it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[84,268],"elapsed":5.194292375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-84264733,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
