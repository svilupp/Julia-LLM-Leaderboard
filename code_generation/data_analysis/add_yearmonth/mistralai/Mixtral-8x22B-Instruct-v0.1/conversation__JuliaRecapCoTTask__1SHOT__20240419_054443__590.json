[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the given problem and special instructions, here is a Julia function that should solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    yearmonth = [Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n\n    # Add new column ym to the DataFrame\n    df.ym = yearmonth\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and assumes that it has a column named `dt` containing DateTimes. It then creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column, concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", and adding this new column to the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function uses the `DataFrames` and `Dates` standard libraries, as per the guidelines. Also, it uses general type annotations (`DataFrame` for the input argument) and emphasizes performance and clarity.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(2022, 1, 1), Date(2022, 2, 1), Date(2022, 3, 1)])\n\n# Add the ym column to the DataFrame\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Print the DataFrame\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n         dt      ym\n1 2022-01-01 202201\n2 2022-02-01 202202\n3 2022-03-01 202203\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `ym` column has been added to the DataFrame, containing the year and month from the `dt` column, concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[394,493],"elapsed":12.48232175,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-339574270,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
