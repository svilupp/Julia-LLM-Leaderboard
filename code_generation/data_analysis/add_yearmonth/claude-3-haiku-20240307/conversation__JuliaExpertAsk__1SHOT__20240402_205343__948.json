Use `Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\")` to extract the year and month from the `dt` column and format it as a string.\n2. Use `parse.(Int, ...)` to convert the string representation to an integer.\n3. Assign the result to a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame using the broadcasted assignment `df[!, :ym] = ...`.\n\nThis function modifies the input DataFrame in-place and returns the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[115,226],"elapsed":2.617231959,"cost":0.00031125000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":8100,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
