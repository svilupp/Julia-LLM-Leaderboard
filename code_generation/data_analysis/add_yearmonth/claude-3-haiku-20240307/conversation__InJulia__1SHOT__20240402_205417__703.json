Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a Julia function that does what you've described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = (year.(df.dt) .* 100) .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. It creates a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame using the assignment operator `[!, :]`.\n3. The values for the `:ym` column are calculated by:\n   - `year.(df.dt)` - This extracts the year from the `dt` column as an array of integers.\n   - `month.(df.dt)` - This extracts the month from the `dt` column as an array of integers.\n   - The year is multiplied by 100 to move it to the left by two digits, and then the month is added to it. This results in a value in the format \"yyyymm\".\n4. The modified DataFrame is returned.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTime[DateTime(2022, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 15), DateTime(2023, 5, 30)])\n\n# Add the 'ym' column\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will give you the following DataFrame:\n\n```\n             dt    ym\n1  2022-01-01 00:00  202201\n2  2022-02-15 00:00  202202\n3  2023-05-30 00:00  202305\n```\n\nThe `ym` column now contains the year and month concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[78,430],"elapsed":4.589626875,"cost":0.000557,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20776,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
