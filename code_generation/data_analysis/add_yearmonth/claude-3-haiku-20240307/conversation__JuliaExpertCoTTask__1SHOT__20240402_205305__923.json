The expression `year(dt) * 100 + month(dt)` computes the desired \"yyyymm\" format for each row.\n   - We then assign the resulting list to the `ym` column of the input DataFrame.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n   - The example usage at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the `add_yearmonth` function and verifies that the output DataFrame has the expected `ym` column.\n\nThe output of the code will be:\n\n```\n                  dt    ym\n1 2020-05-24 00:00:00 202005\n2 2021-01-15 00:00:00 202101\n3 2022-12-05 00:00:00 202212\n```","status":200,"tokens":[225,508],"elapsed":4.70183475,"cost":0.00069125,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-28191,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
