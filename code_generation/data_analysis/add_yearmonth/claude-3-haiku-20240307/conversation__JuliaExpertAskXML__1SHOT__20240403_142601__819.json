Use `Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\")` to extract the year and month from the `dt` column and format it as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n2. Use `parse.(Int, ...)` to convert the string representation to an integer.\n3. Assign the result to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nThis function modifies the input DataFrame in-place and returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[120,174],"elapsed":2.195237792,"cost":0.0002475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8145,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
