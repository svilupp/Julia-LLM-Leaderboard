Use `Dates.format` to extract the year and month from each `dt` value in the format \"yyyymm\".\n2. Use `parse` to convert the resulting string to an integer.\n3. Assign the new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame will have the new column `ym` with the desired values.","status":200,"tokens":[259,315],"elapsed":3.341538459,"cost":0.00045850000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-15696,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
