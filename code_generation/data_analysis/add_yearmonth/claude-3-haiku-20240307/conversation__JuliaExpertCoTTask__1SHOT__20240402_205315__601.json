Think through the approach: To create the new `ym` column, we need to extract the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenate them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n2. Write the function: The `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and modifies it by adding a new column `ym` with the desired format.\n3. Solve the task: Inside the function, we use the `map` function to apply the transformation to each element of the `dt` column. We extract the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, respectively, and concatenate them together as an integer using the formula `Dates.year(x) * 100 + Dates.month(x)`.\n4. Check the solution: We create a sample DataFrame `df` and call the `add_yearmonth` function to verify that it works as expected.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame `df` will have an additional column `ym` with the values `202005`, `202101`, and `202212`.","status":200,"tokens":[225,373],"elapsed":3.7560655,"cost":0.0005225000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13598,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
