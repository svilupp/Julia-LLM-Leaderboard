We then multiply the year by 100 and add the month to get the desired \"yyyymm\" format, and assign the result to the `ym` column of the DataFrame.\n\n4. **Check the solution**: The provided example usage demonstrates the correct behavior of the `add_yearmonth` function.\n\nThe output of the code will be:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n         dt                ym\n DateTime  Int64\n 2020-05-24 202005\n 2021-01-15 202101\n 2022-12-05 202212\n```","status":200,"tokens":[225,406],"elapsed":4.186627625,"cost":0.00056375,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":749,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
