Let's assume that the DataFrame is from the `DataFrames` package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first import the necessary packages. `DataFrames` is used for DataFrame operations, and `Dates` provides functionality to manipulate dates and times. \n\nThen, within the function, we create a new column named 'ym' in the DataFrame by using the `format` function of `Dates` to convert the datetime in the 'dt' column into a string in the 'yyyymm' format. \n\nAfter executing this function, the original `df` DataFrame will have a new column 'ym' added to it.","status":200,"tokens":[124,205],"elapsed":9.800607292,"cost":7.476000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2084476759,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
