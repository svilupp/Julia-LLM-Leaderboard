[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It makes use of the Dates and DataFrames libraries in Julia. We first convert the datetime to a YearMonth object, then create a string using the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df = copy(df) # Avoids mutation of the input dataframe\n\n    # Convert 'dt' to a YearMonth object, then to an integer\n    df[!, :ym] = Tuple.(yearmonth.(df[!, :dt]))\n    \n    # Format the YearMonth into a string with format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[!, :ym] = string.(df[!, :ym], base = 10, pad = 5) .* \"01\"\n\n    df[!, :ym] = parse.(Int, df[!, :ym])\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nHere we make use of the `paste` function to combine the string representations of the year and month, adding a 01 at the end because Julia's YearMonth does not retain the day. If multiple days occur in a month, it will be consistent with this solution. \n\nLet me know if you have any special instructions and we can modify the solution accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[412,300],"elapsed":17.669063625,"cost":0.00014168,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":732158054,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
