Then, you can define your function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:\"ym\"] = Int64.((Year.(df[:\"dt\"]) .* 100) .+ Month.(df[:\"dt\"]))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function should be pretty straightforward. Importantly, it converts the Year and Month part of each DateTime in the `dt` column of the DataFrame to integers, multiplies the year by 100, and then adds these two values to give an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\nThis function returns the DataFrame with the new `ym` column.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your `dt` column is of type DateTime from Dates.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[124,207],"elapsed":12.010586959,"cost":7.532e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-868240196,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
