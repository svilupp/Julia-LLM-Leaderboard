[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Please note, this solution assumes Dates package and DataFrames package are loaded and accessible on the REPL environment.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[!, :ym] = (dt -> parse(Int, Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\"))).(df[!, :dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nWhen you pass a DataFrame `df` with a column `dt` of type DateTime, this function converts every DateTime into an integer representing its year and month (“yyyymm”), and adds this as a new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n\nAn example usage:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DataFrame\ndata = DataFrame(dt = DateTime(now()) + Day(i) for i in 1:4)\n\n# Add the year and month column\ndata_with_ym = add_yearmonth(data)\n```\n\nThis will add a `ym` column to `data` DataFrame, with each row being the year and month of the `dt` field, formatted as `yyyymm` which is an integer, for each `dt` value in the `data` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[412,289],"elapsed":11.136315792,"cost":0.0001386,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1758348454,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
