Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = floor.(Int, df.dt .|> year .* 100 .+ df.dt .|> month)\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first import the necessary libraries. We then define the function `add_yearmonth()`, which takes a DataFrame as an argument. \n\nWithin this function, for each DateTime in the DataFrame, we extract the year and month using the `year()` and `month()` functions from the Dates library. The year is multiplied by 100 and added to the month (ensuring the month is always two digits) to give the required \"yyyymm\" format. This new value is stored in a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nFinally, we call `add_yearmonth()` with the provided DataFrame and display the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[252,304],"elapsed":12.411702166,"cost":0.00012040000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1544840176,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
