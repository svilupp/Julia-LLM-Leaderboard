Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that uses the `Dates` package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[!, \"ym\"] = year.(df[!, \"dt\"]) .* 100 .+ month.(df[!, \"dt\"])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `year` and `month` functions of the `Dates` package to extract the year and month from the `dt` column, respectively. It then concatenates them together by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month. The result is a new column `ym` in the `df` DataFrame, which has the format: “yyyymm”.\n\nPlease note that `year.(df[!, \"dt\"])` and `month.(df[!, \"dt\"])` are element-wise year and month extraction. The `!` is used to indicate that we are performing operations in-place. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the `dt` column in the DataFrame is of a type that supports the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions (like `DateTime` or `Date`). If it's not the case, you need to convert it first to a supported type using `Dates.DateTime(your_datetime)` before extracting the year and month.","status":200,"tokens":[124,311],"elapsed":13.380379291,"cost":0.00010444,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1946859368,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
