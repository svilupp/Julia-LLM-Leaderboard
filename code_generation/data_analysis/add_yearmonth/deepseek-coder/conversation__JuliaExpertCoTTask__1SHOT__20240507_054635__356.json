We also use the DataFrames package to handle the DataFrame.\n\nTo solve this task, we should first import the necessary packages:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n# Then, define the add_yearmonth function:\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n\n# Then, create the DataFrame:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n# To use the function, you just need to call it with the DataFrame as an argument:\n\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, the DataFrame `df` will have a new column `ym` which consists of the year and the month extracted from the date in `dt` column.\n\nPlease note this will only work with DataFrames (Julia's DataFrame package) and not other DataFrame-like structures like DataTables (R, python) or pandas (python's DataFrame structure).","status":200,"tokens":[252,290],"elapsed":13.303975208,"cost":0.00011648000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1593995016,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
