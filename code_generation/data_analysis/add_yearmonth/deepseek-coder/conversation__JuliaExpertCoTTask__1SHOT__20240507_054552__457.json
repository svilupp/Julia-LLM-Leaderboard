Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = string.(Dates.year.(df.dt)) .* lpad.(Dates.month.(df.dt), 2, \"0\")\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function `add_yearmonth` is creating a new column \"ym\" by extracting the year and month from the existing \"dt\" column. The columns of a DataFrame can be accessed using the \".\" operator. The `year` function is used to extract the year and the `month` function is used to extract the month. `string` function is used to convert the year and month to string. The `lpad` function is used to pad the month number with zero if it is less than 10. \"0\" is prepended to the month using `lpad`. The new column \"ym\" is created by concatenating the year and the padded month with \"*\" operator. The final DataFrame is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[252,315],"elapsed":13.524383625,"cost":0.00012348,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1505225755,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
