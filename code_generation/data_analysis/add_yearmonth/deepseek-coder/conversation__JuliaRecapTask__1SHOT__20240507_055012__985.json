[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\")\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that `dt` column in the DataFrame contains `DateTime` objects. The function uses `Dates.format` function to transform the DateTime object into the desired format \"yyyymm\". The `.` operator broadcasts the function to all elements of the column.\n\nNote: This function modifies the original DataFrame. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should make a copy of it before applying this function.\n\nYou need to add `using Dates` and `using DataFrames` in your file if they are not imported in the same file.","status":200,"tokens":[410,195],"elapsed":8.613744959,"cost":0.00011200000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1926716980,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
