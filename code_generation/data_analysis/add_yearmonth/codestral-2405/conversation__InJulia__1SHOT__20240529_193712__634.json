It then uses the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions to separately extract the year and month from this `YearMonth` object. Each year is multiplied by 100 to make room for the month, and then the month is added. The result is a new `ym` column in the `df` DataFrame containing the desired year-month integers.","status":200,"tokens":[75,232],"elapsed":1.633106,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1221756366,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
