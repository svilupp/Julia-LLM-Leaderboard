It uses the `Dates` package to extract the year and month from the DateTime objects, and then concatenates them together as a string, which is then converted to an integer.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = [parse(Int, Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\")) for dt in df[:dt]]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that your DataFrame is named `df` and that the column with DateTime objects is named `dt`. It creates a new column in `df` called `ym`. If `dt` does not exist or is not of DateTime type, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[75,181],"elapsed":1.298398458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1781117030,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
