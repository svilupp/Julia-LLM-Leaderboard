The year is multiplied by 100 to ensure that it occupies the first four digits of the resulting integer.\n\nNote that the `!` notation is used to modify the DataFrame directly, without creating a new one. This is a feature of the DataFrames.jl package and is a more efficient way to modify large DataFrames.","status":200,"tokens":[117,229],"elapsed":1.625605291,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2116172248,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
