Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define the `add_yearmonth` function in Julia using the DataFrames.jl and Dates.jl packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt) .|> ym -> ym.year * 100 + ym.month\nend\n```\n\nThis will add a new column to the DataFrame `df` named `ym`. The values in this column are created by first extracting the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column using `Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt)`. This results in an array of `YearMonth` objects.\n\nNext, the `|>` (pipe) operator is used to pass each `YearMonth` object in the array to the function `ym -> ym.year * 100 + ym.month`. This function takes a `YearMonth` object, extracts the year and month, and combines them into a single integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nFinally, the result is assigned to the `ym` column of the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[117,270],"elapsed":1.920039041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1102020228,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
