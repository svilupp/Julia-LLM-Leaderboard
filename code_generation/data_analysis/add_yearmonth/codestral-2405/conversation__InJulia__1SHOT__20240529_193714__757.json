I can help you with that. Here's a function `add_yearmonth` that you can use in Julia to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame `df` and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[!, :ym] = [Dates.year(dt) * 100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over each datetime in the `dt` column, extracts the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions from the `Dates` package, and then concatenates them together using the `*` operator. The resulting integer is then added as a new column `ym` to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[75,228],"elapsed":1.597352875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":873892226,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
