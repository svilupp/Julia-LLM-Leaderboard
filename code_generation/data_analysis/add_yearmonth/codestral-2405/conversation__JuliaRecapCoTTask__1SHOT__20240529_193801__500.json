[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Int.(Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, extracts the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column, concatenates them together as a string, and then converts that string to an integer. It then adds this new column to the DataFrame. The `!` in the function name is a convention in Julia to indicate that the function modifies its input.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies the input DataFrame in-place. If you want to create a new DataFrame with the new column, you can remove the `!` from the function name and return a new DataFrame with the new column.","status":200,"tokens":[385,220],"elapsed":4.577371583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-551138171,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
