[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple function in Julia that does what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\") .|> (x -> parse(Int, x))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function modifies the DataFrame `df` by adding a new column `ym`. It first uses the `Dates.format` function to convert the `dt` column into a string with the format \"yyyymm\". Then, it converts that string into an integer using the `parse` function. The `.|>` operator is used to pipe the result of the previous operation into the next one.\n\nNote: This function modifies `df` in-place. If you want to keep `df` unchanged, you can create a copy of `df` before modifying it.","status":200,"tokens":[75,216],"elapsed":1.547008125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1496527487,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
