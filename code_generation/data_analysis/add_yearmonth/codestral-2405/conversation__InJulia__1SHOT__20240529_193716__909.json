Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help with that. In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to extract the year and month from a datetime. Here's a function that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\")), df[!, :dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input. It creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame by applying a transformation to each element of the `dt` column. The transformation is defined by the anonymous function `x -> parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\"))`. This function formats the datetime `x` as a string in the format \"yyyymm\", and then converts that string to an integer. The results are stored in the new `ym` column.\n\nRemember to include the `DataFrames` and `Dates` packages at the beginning of your Julia script. If they're not already installed, you can add them to your Julia environment using the package manager.","status":200,"tokens":[75,278],"elapsed":1.936772208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":374522599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
