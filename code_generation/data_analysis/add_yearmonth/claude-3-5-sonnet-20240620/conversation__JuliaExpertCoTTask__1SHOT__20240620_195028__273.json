Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Let's solve this task step by step.\n\nStep 1: Think through the approach\nWe need to:\n1. Create a function called `add_yearmonth`\n2. Extract year and month from the `dt` column\n3. Concatenate year and month as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format\n4. Add the result as a new column `ym` to the DataFrame\n\nStep 2: Write the function\nHere's the implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = map(dt -> year(dt) * 100 + month(dt), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\nThe function is now ready to use. We can apply it to the given DataFrame.\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nresult = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt                    ym     \n     │ DateTime              Int64  \n─────┼─────────────────────────────\n   1 │ 2020-05-24T00:00:00  202005\n   2 │ 2021-01-15T00:00:00  202101\n   3 │ 2022-12-05T00:00:00  202212\n```\n\nThe solution correctly adds the `ym` column with the year and month concatenated as an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format. The function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[225,435],"elapsed":6.079865125,"cost":0.007200000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11204,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
