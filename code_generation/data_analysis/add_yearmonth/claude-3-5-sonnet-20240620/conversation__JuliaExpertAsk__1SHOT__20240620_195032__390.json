Uses broadcasting to extract year and month from the `dt` column\n2. Multiplies year by 100 and adds month to create the \"yyyymm\" format\n3. Converts the result to integers\n4. Assigns the result to a new column `ym`\n5. Returns the modified DataFrame\n\nUse it like this:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth!(df)\n```\n\nNote: The function modifies the DataFrame in-place for efficiency. If you prefer a non-mutating version, remove the `!` from the function name and use `transform` instead of direct assignment.","status":200,"tokens":[115,214],"elapsed":3.889990417,"cost":0.003555,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13071,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
