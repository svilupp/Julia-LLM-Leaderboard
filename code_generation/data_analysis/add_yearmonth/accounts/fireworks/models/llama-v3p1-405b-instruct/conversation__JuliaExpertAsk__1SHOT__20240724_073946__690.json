Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> year(x) * 100 + month(x), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function destructively modifies the DataFrame with a new column, `ym`. The map function applied to every element of the `dt` column extracts the year, multiplied by 100, then adds the month to create the yearmonth “yyyymm” format. Finally, it returns the updated DataFrame. Remember to copy your DataFrame before using this function if you need to keep the original unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[113,152],"elapsed":5.043131459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1586431559,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
