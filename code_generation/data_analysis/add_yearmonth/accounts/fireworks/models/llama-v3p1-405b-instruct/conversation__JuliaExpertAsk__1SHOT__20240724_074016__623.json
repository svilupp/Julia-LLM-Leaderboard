See docs for mutating method `getproperty!` as well as `year` and `month` from the Dates package. \n\nThe `yearmonth` helper function performs the year and month extraction and then concatenates them into an integer value. \n\nThe usage example demonstrates how to use this function by creating a sample DataFrame and then adding the `ym` column to it.","status":200,"tokens":[113,228],"elapsed":8.132775791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1678472538,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
