Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = Int64.(year.(df.dt)) .* 100 .+ Int64.(month.(df.dt))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym` which is the year and month of the `dt` column concatenated together. The `.!` operator is used to add a new column to the DataFrame.\n\nHere's how this function works:\n\n- `year.(df.dt)` extracts the year from each DateTime object in the `dt` column.\n- `month.(df.dt)` extracts the month from each DateTime object in the `dt` column.\n- `Int64.(year.(df.dt)) .* 100` converts the years to Int64 and multiplies them by 100 to shift the digits of the year two places to the left, making room for the month.\n- `. + Int64.(month.(df.dt))` adds the months to the years, concatenated together as required.\n\nThe function is mutating, which means it modifies the DataFrame in-place. It returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nIf you don't want to modify the original DataFrame, you can use the following function instead:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    new_df = copy(df)\n    new_df[!, :ym] = Int64.(year.(new_df.dt)) .* 100 .+ Int64.(month.(new_df.dt))\n    return new_df\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function returns a new DataFrame that includes the `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[78,350],"elapsed":11.5457925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":555164538,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
