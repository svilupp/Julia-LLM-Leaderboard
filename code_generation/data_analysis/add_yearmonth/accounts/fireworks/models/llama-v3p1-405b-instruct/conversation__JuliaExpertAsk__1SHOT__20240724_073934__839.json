Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that accomplishes this task using the DataFrames and Dates packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(dt -> year(dt) * 100 + month(dt), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and modifies it by adding a new column `ym`. The `ym` column is calculated by mapping over the `dt` column, extracting the year and month from each DateTime object, multiplying the year by 100 to shift the digits two places to the left, then adding the month. The result is an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". \n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = [DateTime(2022, 1, 1), DateTime(2022, 2, 1), DateTime(2022, 3, 1)]\ndf = DataFrame(dt=dt)\nadd_yearmonth!(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nThis example creates a DataFrame `df` with a single column `dt` containing some sample DateTime values, then calls `add_yearmonth!` to add a new column `ym` to `df`. The modified DataFrame is then printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[113,274],"elapsed":8.618501792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1422554350,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
