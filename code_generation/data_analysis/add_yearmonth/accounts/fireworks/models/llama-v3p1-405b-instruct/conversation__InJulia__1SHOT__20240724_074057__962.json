You can also achieve that using \nDate's `YearMonth`, this is the simplest, most trivial, implementation:\n```julia \n[df[!,:ym]  = Int64(format(YearMonth(x), \"YYYYMM\")) for x = df[!,:dt]]] # or the equivalent map (x -> (formatYearMonth(x), \"YYYYMM\")) does work. \n```\nChoose the version that fits best your  Data and needs.\n\n\n\nHowever, you will get an error if the column type is not a DateTime compatible representation, like datesstring. Similarly, there is no guarantee for the results If our `dt` input as supposed, doesn't evaluate to a proper date type representation. First, find the format they are or as exactly string and convert from \"text input 1 is [input 1 | “f t\"]” first - Thanks for reporting me bugs, the dev you employed done the work as needed in an exact manner.\nIf you might wish to learn for a long lifetime what Julia can still do to you and create/avoid hard to find a bug for an average one. Keep good with simpler equivalent trivial implementation variant of “year-month” algorithm (since Julia [now] has more than trivial language of packages  which could have fixed this time automatically.\n```= block\ntransform_year_month  is helper function useful for “Year [y]Month[Month]\"” when month “year from firstdate month “is not same as other method when Year actually is always to be same, just using first available “date” input field method by constant it's still available (usually called an “old one).\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,756],"elapsed":29.832582708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1648995397,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
