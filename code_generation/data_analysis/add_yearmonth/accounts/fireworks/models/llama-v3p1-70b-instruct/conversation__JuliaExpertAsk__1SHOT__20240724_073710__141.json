The `map` function applies the anonymous function `x -> 100 * year(x) + month(x)` to each element of the `dt` column, which extracts the year and month from the DateTime and concatenates them as an integer. The result is assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[113,192],"elapsed":2.259965584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-273616462,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
