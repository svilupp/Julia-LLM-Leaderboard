Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Dates` package in Julia to achieve this. Here is a concise function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = [ Dates.year(row.dt) * 100 + Dates.month(row.dt) for row in eachrow(df) ]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each row in the DataFrame, extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, and then multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month. The resulting array is then added to the DataFrame as a new column named `ym`.\n\nYou can also use the `map` function for more concise syntax:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = map(row -> Dates.year(row.dt) * 100 + Dates.month(row.dt), eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2022-01-01\"), DateTime(\"2022-02-01\"), DateTime(\"2023-01-01\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n3 rows × 2 columns\n  dt         ym\n  DateTime   Int64\n1 2022-01-01 202201\n2 2022-02-01 202202\n3 2023-01-01 202301\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,295],"elapsed":3.553175834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1966171428,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
