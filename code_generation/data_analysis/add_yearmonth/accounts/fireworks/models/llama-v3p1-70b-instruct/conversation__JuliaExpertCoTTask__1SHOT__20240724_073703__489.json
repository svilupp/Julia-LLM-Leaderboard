We will use the `map` function to apply a transformation to the `dt` column. We will use the `year` and `month` functions to extract the year and month from each DateTime object, and then concatenate them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\n### Step 2: Write the code\n\nWe define the function `add_yearmonth`, which creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame by mapping the transformation to the `dt` column. The transformation is a lambda function that multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to get the desired integer format.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nWe create a DataFrame `df` with a `dt` column containing DateTime objects. We then call the `add_yearmonth` function to add the `ym` column to the DataFrame.\n\n### Step 4: Check the solution\n\nThe resulting DataFrame will have the new `ym` column with the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[214,353],"elapsed":3.955219416,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":560205409,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
