The `!` symbol in the assignment indicates that the DataFrame may be modified by the operation. The function uses a list comprehension to create the new column. For each `DateTime` object in the `dt` column, it extracts the year and month, converts them into a single integer in the format \"yyyymm\" and assigns it to the new column `ym`.\n\nThen, the DataFrame `df` is defined with three rows of DateTime values. Finally, the `add_yearmonth` function is called on the DataFrame and the modified DataFrame is printed to the console, showing the original `dt` column and the newly added `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[214,341],"elapsed":3.995200708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1468116915,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
