Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yyyymm\").(Int)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and assumes that it has a column named `dt` containing DateTimes. It creates a new column named `ym` by extracting the year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting integer is then converted to an `Int` type and stored in the `df.ym` column.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTimes[DateTime(2020,1,1), DateTime(2020,2,1), DateTime(2020,3,1)])\ndf = add_yearmonth","status":200,"tokens":[77,200],"elapsed":3.550030292,"cost":0.00044319999999999993,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":712506969,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
