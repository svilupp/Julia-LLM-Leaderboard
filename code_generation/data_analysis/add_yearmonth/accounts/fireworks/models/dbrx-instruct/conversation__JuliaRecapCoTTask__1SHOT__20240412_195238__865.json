X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Based on your instructions, here's how I would approach the problem:\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets for this task:\n- To extract the year and month from a DateTime object, we can use the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates standard library.\n- To concatenate two integers, we can use the `*` operator to convert them to strings and then concatenate them.\n- To add a new column to a DataFrame, we can simply assign a new array to the desired column name.\n\nHere's the function that implements the above approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt) * 100.+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it.
