[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Here's a function that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = yearmonth.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n\nfunction yearmonth(dt::DateTime)\n    return Year(dt)*100 + Month(dt)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `add_yearmonth` is a function that takes a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `ym` column is created by applying the `yearmonth` function to each element of the `dt` column.\n\nThe `yearmonth` function takes a single `DateTime` object and returns an integer representing the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\". It does this by multiplying the year by 100 and then adding the month. This is similar to the common practice of encoding a date as a single integer by multiplying the year by 10000,","status":200,"tokens":[335,200],"elapsed":4.2380605,"cost":0.000856,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-721040329,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
