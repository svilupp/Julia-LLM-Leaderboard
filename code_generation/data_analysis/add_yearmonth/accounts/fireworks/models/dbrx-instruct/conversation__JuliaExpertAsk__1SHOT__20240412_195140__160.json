The `.*` and `.+` operators are used for element-wise multiplication and addition, respectively.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> using DataFrames, Dates\n\njulia> df = DataFrame(dt = DateTime(2020, 1, 1):Day(1):DateTime(2020, 12, 31))\n366×1 DataFrame\n│ Row │ dt                  │\n│     │ DateTime","status":200,"tokens":[112,200],"elapsed":3.359569959,"cost":0.0004992,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1221981577,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
