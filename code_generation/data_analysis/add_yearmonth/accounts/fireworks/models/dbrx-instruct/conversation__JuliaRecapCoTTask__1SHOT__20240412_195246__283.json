[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Based on the special instructions provided, I will create a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column `ym` with the year and month extracted from the `dt` column. I will use the `Dates` standard library in Julia to extract the year and month from the DateTime objects. Here's the code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Create a function to extract year and month from a DateTime object\n    yearmonth(dt::DateTime) = Year(dt).value * 100 + Month(dt).value\n    \n    # Apply the function to the dt column and add it as a new column to the DataFrame\n    df.ym = yearmonth.(df.dt)\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1.
