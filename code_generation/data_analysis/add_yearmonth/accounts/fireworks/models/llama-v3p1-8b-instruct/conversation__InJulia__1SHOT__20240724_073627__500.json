The result is then assigned as the new `ym` column.\n\nPlease ensure you have the following packages installed:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n```\n\nThis function does not modify the original DataFrame. If you want the modification to be in place (i.e., the function modifies the original DataFrame), you can change the `df[!, :ym] = ...` line to `df.`:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:, :ym] = Int64.(floor.(Dates.year.(df.dt)).* 100 + floor.(Dates.month.(df.dt)))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nAnd call it by using `add_yearmonth!(df)`.","status":200,"tokens":[78,269],"elapsed":1.001823334,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1661102380,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
