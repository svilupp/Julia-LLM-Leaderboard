[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We define the `add_yearmonth` function that takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2.  Inside the function, we create a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame using the `map` function to operate on each value in the `:dt` column.\n3.  We extract the year and month from each `:dt` value using the `year` and `month` fields of the `Date` type.\n4.  We concatenate the year and month together into a single integer by multiplying the year by 100 and then adding the month.\n5.  Finally, we return the modified DataFrame with the new `:ym` column.\n\nYou can run this code with the DataFrames.jl and Dates.jl packages loaded to see the results. The package loading is omitted here for brevity, but you would typically import them in your Julia script or ensure they are already loaded in your environment.","status":200,"tokens":[336,332],"elapsed":1.218374375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":978609575,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
