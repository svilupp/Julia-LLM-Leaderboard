Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df = copy(df)  # Create a copy to avoid mutating original DataFrame\n    df.ym = Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt) .|> ym -> Year(ym).value * 100 + Month(ym).value\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input and performs the following steps:\n\n1. It creates a copy of the input `DataFrame` to avoid modifying the original data.\n2. It adds a new column `ym` to the copied `DataFrame`.\n3. The values in the `ym` column are computed by:\n   a. Extracting the `yearmonth` values from the `dt` column using `Dates.yearmonth.(df.dt)`.\n   b. Broadcasting the anonymous function `ym -> Year(ym).value * 100 + Month(ym).value` over the `yearmonth` values.\n   c. This function extracts the year and month values as integers and concatenates them in the desired format \"yyyymm\".\n4. The modified `DataFrame` with the new `ym` column is returned.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\ndates = DateTime(2023, 3, 15, 12, 34, 56), DateTime(2022, 11, 1, 9, 0, 0)\ndf = DataFrame(dt=dates)\n\ndf_with_yearmonth = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, `df_with_yearmonth` will have an additional column `ym` with values `202303` and `202211` corresponding to the year and month extracted from the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[115,413],"elapsed":9.169716958,"cost":0.00654,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
