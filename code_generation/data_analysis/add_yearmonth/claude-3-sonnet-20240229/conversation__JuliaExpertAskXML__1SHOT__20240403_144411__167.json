It creates a new column `:ym` in the input `DataFrame` using the assignment `df[!, :ym]`.\n2. The values for the new column are computed by extracting the year and month components from the `:dt` column using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module.\n3. The year and month values are combined into a single integer by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month: `year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt)`.\n4. The resulting `DataFrame` with the new `:ym` column is returned.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input `DataFrame` by adding a new column. If you want to create a new `DataFrame` without modifying the original, you can use a copy: `df_new = add_yearmonth(copy(df))`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,272],"elapsed":5.660271209,"cost":0.00444,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10797,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
