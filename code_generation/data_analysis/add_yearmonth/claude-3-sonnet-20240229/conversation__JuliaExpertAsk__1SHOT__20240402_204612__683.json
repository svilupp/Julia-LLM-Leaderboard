Using broadcasting `.`, it extracts the year from the `dt` column using `Dates.year(df.dt)`, converts it to an integer with `Int`, and multiplies by 100.\n2. It adds the month from the `dt` column using `Dates.month(df.dt)` to the year value.\n3. The resulting vector of integers in the format \"yyyymm\" is stored in the variable `ym`.\n4. The function `DataFrames.insertcols!` is used to add a new column `ym` to the input `DataFrame` `df` with the values stored in the `ym` vector.\n5. The modified `DataFrame` `df` with the new `ym` column is returned.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input `DataFrame` in-place by adding the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[115,291],"elapsed":5.995753625,"cost":0.00471,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21942,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
