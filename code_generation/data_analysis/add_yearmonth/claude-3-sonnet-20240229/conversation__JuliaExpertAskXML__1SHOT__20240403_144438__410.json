The year and month values are combined into a single integer in the format \"yyyymm\" using vectorized operations.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. `year.(df.dt)` extracts the year component from each `DateTime` value in the `:dt` column.\n2. `month.(df.dt)` extracts the month component from each `DateTime` value in the `:dt` column.\n3. The year values are multiplied by 100 to shift them two decimal places to the left, allowing space for the month component to be concatenated.\n4. The year and month values are combined using element-wise vector addition `.+`.\n5. The resulting vector of \"yyyymm\" integers is assigned to the new `:ym` column using `df[!, :ym]`.\n\nThe function returns the updated `DataFrame` with the new `:ym` column added.","status":200,"tokens":[120,301],"elapsed":7.086558041,"cost":0.004875,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20393,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
