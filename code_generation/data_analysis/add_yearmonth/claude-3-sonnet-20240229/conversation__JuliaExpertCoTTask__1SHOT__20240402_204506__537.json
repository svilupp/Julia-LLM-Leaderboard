It creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each DateTime in `dt` using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module. The year and month are then concatenated as an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month.\n\nTo use this function, you would call it with your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return the original DataFrame with a new column `ym` added, containing the year and month values in the \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[225,257],"elapsed":5.040139416,"cost":0.00453,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18119,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
