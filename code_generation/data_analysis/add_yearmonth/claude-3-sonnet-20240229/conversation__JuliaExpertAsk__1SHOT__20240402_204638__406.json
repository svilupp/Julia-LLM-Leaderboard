The year and month components are combined into a single integer value in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. `Dates.year.(df.dt)` extracts the year component from the `:dt` column.\n2. `Dates.month.(df.dt)` extracts the month component from the `:dt` column.\n3. `year .* 100 .+ month` combines the year and month by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month.\n4. `df[!, :ym] = ...` creates a new column `:ym` in the `DataFrame` `df` and assigns the combined year-month values to it.\n5. The modified `DataFrame` `df` with the new column `:ym` is returned.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input `DataFrame` `df` by adding the new column `:ym`. If you want to preserve the original `DataFrame`, you can create a copy before calling the function:\n\n```julia\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(copy(df))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,344],"elapsed":6.720465042,"cost":0.005505,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20557,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
