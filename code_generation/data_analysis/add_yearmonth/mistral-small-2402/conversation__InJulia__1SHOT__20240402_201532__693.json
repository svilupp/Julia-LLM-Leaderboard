The format string `\"yyyymm\"` specifies that we want to extract the year and month as a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting string is then parsed as an integer using the `parse` function. The resulting integer column is added to the DataFrame as a new column named `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,175],"elapsed":1.919018792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1120296162,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
