[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution that follows the guidelines and special instructions:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(row -> Dates.year(row[:dt]) * 100 + Dates.month(row[:dt]), eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `ym` column is created by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions from the `Dates` standard library. The year and month are then concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month. The `map` function is used to apply this transformation to each row of the DataFrame.\n\nTo test this function, you could use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(\"2022-01-01\"), Date(\"2022-02-01\"), Date(\"2023-03-01\")])\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt            ym\n     │ Date          Int64\n─────┼───────────────────────\n   1 │ 2022-01-01     202201\n   2 │ 2022-02-01     202202\n   3 │ 2023-03-01     202303\n```\n\nThis shows that the `ym` column has been correctly added to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[385,446],"elapsed":5.070920541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1869502142,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
