The `\"yyyymm\"` format string specifies that we want to extract the year and month as a string in the format \"yyyymm\". The `parse` function is then used to convert this string to an integer. The resulting new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[117,161],"elapsed":2.899854167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1015174092,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
