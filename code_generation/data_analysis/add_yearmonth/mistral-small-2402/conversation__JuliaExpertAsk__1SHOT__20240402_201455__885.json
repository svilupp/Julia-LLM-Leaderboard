Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a concise function in Julia that does the job:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = Dates.format.(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\") .|> parse.\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Dates.format` function to convert the `dt` column to the desired format as a string. The `parse` function is then used to convert the string back to an integer. The `.|>` operator is a pipe operator that applies the `parse` function to each element in the array.\n\nPlease note that the `parse` function in this case is assuming that the input string is always in the format \"yyyymm\", if that's not the case, you might need to handle the errors accordingly.\n\nAlso, make sure that the `df` DataFrame has the `dt` column before calling this function.\n\nI hope this helps!
