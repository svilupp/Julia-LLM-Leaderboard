We're then multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month to create the desired integer format. Finally, we assign the result to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the task**\n\nNow, let's apply the function to the provided DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n3 rows × 2 columns\n\n dt              ym    \n 2020-05-24    202005\n 2021-01-15    202101\n 2022-12-05    202212\n```\n**Step 4: Check that the solution is correct**\n\nWe can manually verify that the values in the `ym` column match the expected format and values.\n\nAll done!","status":200,"tokens":[215,369],"elapsed":9.523625709,"cost":0.00041836,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-685628127,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
