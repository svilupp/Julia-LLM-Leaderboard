Here is the solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from DateTimes in df\n    ym = map(x -> x.year * 100 + x.month, df[:dt])\n    # Create new column with concatenated year and month as integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[:ym] = ym\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example data\ndf_example = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2015, 7, 1), DateTime(2016, 3, 14), DateTime(2017, 12, 25)])\nadd_yearmonth(df_example)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `map()` function is used to extract year and month from DateTimes in `df[:dt]`. The `map()` function takes a function as an argument, which in this case is `x -> x.year * 100 + x.month`. This function takes each `DateTime` element in `df[:dt]` and returns the year and month as an integer.\n2. The resulting list of integers is then assigned to a new column named `ym` in `df`.\n3. Finally, the modified `df` is returned using the `return` statement.\n\nNote: In this solution, we are assuming that the DateTimes in `df` are in the format `2020-05-24T00:00:00`. If your DateTimes have a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[257,366],"elapsed":20.0183665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
