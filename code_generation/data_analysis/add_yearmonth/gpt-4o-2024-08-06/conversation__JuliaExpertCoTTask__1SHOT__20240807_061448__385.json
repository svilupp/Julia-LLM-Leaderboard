Import the necessary libraries.\n2. Define the function `add_yearmonth` and ensure it accepts the DataFrame as an argument.\n3. Extract the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column.\n4. Format these extracted values into the desired \"yyyymm\" format and store them as integers in a new column `ym`.\n5. Return the modified DataFrame and verify the solution using the provided data.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Create a new column `ym` by extracting and formatting Year and Month from `dt`\n    df.ym = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Provided Data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Apply the function\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Display the modified DataFrame\nprintln(df_with_ym)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The function `add_yearmonth` uses list comprehension to iterate over each `DateTime` entry in the `dt` column and extract the `year` and `month`.\n- These values are formatted into the form \"yyyymm\" by computing `year * 100 + month`.\n- The new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame, which is then returned. The function is applied to the provided data to test the implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[216,337],"elapsed":3.516891208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1341546845,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
