Import the necessary packages.\n2. Define the function `add_yearmonth`.\n3. Inside the function, extract the year and month from the `dt` column.\n4. Concatenate the extracted year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".\n5. Add this new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n6. Return the modified DataFrame.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Apply the function\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nLet's explain briefly:\n- The `year(dt)` function extracts the year from a DateTime `dt`.\n- The `month(dt)` function extracts the month from a DateTime `dt`.\n- We multiply the year by 100 and add the month to obtain the \"yyyymm\" format as integer.\n- We use a comprehension to apply this transformation to each DateTime in the `dt` column of the DataFrame and assign the result to a new column `ym`.\n\nNow, you can run this code with the provided Data and it will add the `ym` column to the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[216,317],"elapsed":10.009757417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1621437229,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
