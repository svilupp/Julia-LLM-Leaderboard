[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Let's also verify with an example:\n\n```julia\n# Example Usage\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(2023, 10, 5), DateTime(2022, 6, 15)])\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(df_with_ym)\n```\n\nExecuting this will show the DataFrame with the additional `ym` column accurately representing the \"yyyymm\" format based on the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[334,411],"elapsed":5.495219458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2022201226,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
