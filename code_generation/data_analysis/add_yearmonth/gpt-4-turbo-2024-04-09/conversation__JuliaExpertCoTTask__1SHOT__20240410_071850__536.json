Extract the year and month from each DateTime entry.\n2. Concatenate the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\" and convert it to an integer.\n3. Append this value as a new column `ym` to the DataFrame.\n\nHere is how you can write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Creating a new column by calculating yyyymm from dt\n    df.ym = [100 * Dates.year(row.dt) + Dates.month(row.dt) for row in eachrow(df)]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Example data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Applying the function\nresult = add_yearmonth(df)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will produce a DataFrame with an additional column `ym` as specified.
