Here is the `add_yearmonth` function that adds the `ym` column to your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = (year.(df.dt) * 100) + month.(df.dt)  # Format as \"yyyymm\"\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that `df.dt` contains `DateTime` or `Date` objects. The `year()` and `month()` functions are used to extract the year and month from these objects, respectively. These values are then combined into a single integer formatted as \"yyyymm\" by multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month.","status":200,"tokens":[110,164],"elapsed":3.729982708,"cost":0.00602,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-561236753,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
