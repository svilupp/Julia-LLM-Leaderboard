It uses broadcasting to apply the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module across the `dt` column. Each result is processed to form the `yyyymm` format by calculating `100 * year + month`. The new column `ym` is then appended to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,186],"elapsed":8.765166334,"cost":0.00668,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1111666992,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
