Here is a concise function `add_yearmonth` to add the `ym` column to your DataFrame `df`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = year.(df.dt) * 100 + month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function directly modifies the given DataFrame by creating a new column `ym`. It calculates the `ym` values by multiplying the year of each date in the `dt` column by 100 and then adding the month. This ensures that the year and month are concatenated correctly as an integer in the requested `yyyymm` format.","status":200,"tokens":[110,162],"elapsed":4.302401375,"cost":0.00596,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":241547990,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
