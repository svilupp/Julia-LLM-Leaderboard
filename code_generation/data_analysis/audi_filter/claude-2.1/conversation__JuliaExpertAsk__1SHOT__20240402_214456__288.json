Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to filter the cars DataFrame and add an audi_a4_type column:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    transform!(df_audi, :audi_a4_type => ByRow(=(true)) => true)\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- `filter` filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only audi rows with model a4 or a4 quattro\n- `transform!` adds a new `audi_a4_type` column set to `true` for all rows\n- The DataFrame `df_audi` is returned containing the filtered and transformed data\n\nThis implements the specified requirements concisely in a single pipeline.
