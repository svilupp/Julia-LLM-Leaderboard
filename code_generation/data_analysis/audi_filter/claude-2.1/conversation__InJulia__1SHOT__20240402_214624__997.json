[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The filtered DataFrame is returned with the new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[105,258],"elapsed":7.912216166,"cost":0.007032,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19891,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
