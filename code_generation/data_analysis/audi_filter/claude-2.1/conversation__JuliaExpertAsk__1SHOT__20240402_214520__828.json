Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that performs the requested filtering and column addition:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_a4_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && row.model in audi_a4_models, df_cars)\n    transform!(df_filtered, :audi_a4_type => ByRow(row -> true) => identity)\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nTo explain further:\n\n- `filter` filters the DataFrame to only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n- `transform!` adds a new `audi_a4_type` column filled with `true` for every row\n- The `ByRow(row -> true) => identity` construct creates a column filled with `true` values\n\nSo this returns the filtered DataFrame with the additional column as requested.
