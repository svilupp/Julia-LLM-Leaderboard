Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to filter the DataFrame and add the new column:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    filter_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    transform!(filter_df, :audi_a4_type => _ -> true)\n    return filter_df\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- Use the `filter` function to filter the `df_cars` DataFrame to only rows where `manufacturer == \"audi\"` and `model` is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. This creates a new filtered DataFrame.\n\n- Use `transform!` to add a new `audi_a4_type` column set to `true` across all rows.\n\n- Return the transformed filtered DataFrame.\n\nThis implements the specified behavior concisely in a functional style without mutating the original `df_cars`.
