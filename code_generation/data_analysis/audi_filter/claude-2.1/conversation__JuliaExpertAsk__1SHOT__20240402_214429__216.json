Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that filters the DataFrame to Audi A4 models and adds an audi_a4_type column:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_a4_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    transform!(audi_a4_df, :audi_a4_type => ByRow(x -> true) => :audi_a4_type)\n    return audi_a4_df\nend\n```\n\nTo break this down:\n\n- First we filter `df_cars` to only rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n- This creates a new DataFrame `audi_a4_df` with just those rows\n- We then transform `audi_a4_df` by adding a new `audi_a4_type` column, setting every row to `true`\n- Finally we return the transformed `audi_a4_df`\n\nSo this will filter down to just Audi A4 models and add a column identifying them as Audi A4s.
