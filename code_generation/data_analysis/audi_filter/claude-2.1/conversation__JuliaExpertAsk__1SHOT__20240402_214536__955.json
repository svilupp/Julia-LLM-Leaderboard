Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function to filter the DataFrame and add the new column:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_a4_filter = @. beginswith(df_cars[:manufacturer], \"audi\") & (df_cars[:model] .== \"a4\" || df_cars[:model] .== \"a4 quattro\")\n    df_audi = df_cars[audi_a4_filter, :]\n    df_audi[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n- I create a Boolean filter `audi_a4_filter` that selects rows where the manufacturer begins with \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n- I filter `df_cars` down to those rows and store in `df_audi` \n- I add a new `audi_a4_type` column filled with `true`\n- Return the filtered and transformed DataFrame `df_audi`\n\nThis uses DataFrame indexing, string comparisons, logic with `.&` and `.|`, and broadcast assignment to add the new column.
