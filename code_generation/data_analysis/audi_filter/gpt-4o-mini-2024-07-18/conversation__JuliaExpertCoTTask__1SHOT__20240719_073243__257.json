Create a new column called `audi_a4_type` that is set to `true` for all the filtered rows.\n3.

The DataFrame is filtered using logical conditions.\n2. A new column `audi_a4_type` is created and populated with `true`.\n3. The resulting DataFrame is returned.\n\n### Checking the solution:\nAfter running the above code, we can print the `result` to verify that it contains only the rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` matches the specified conditions, with the new column correctly set.","status":200,"tokens":[293,398],"elapsed":4.839900125,"cost":0.00028274999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":38432509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
