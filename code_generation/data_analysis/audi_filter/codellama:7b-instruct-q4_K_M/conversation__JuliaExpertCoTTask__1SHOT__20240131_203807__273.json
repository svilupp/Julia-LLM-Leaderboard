Then, it filters down the remaining rows to only those with model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using the `isin` method. Finally, it creates a new column \"audi_a4_type\" that equals \"true\" across all rows using the `assign` method. The resulting DataFrame is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":1.879162447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
