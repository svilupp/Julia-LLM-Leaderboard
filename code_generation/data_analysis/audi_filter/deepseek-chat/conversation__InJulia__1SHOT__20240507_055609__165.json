[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then, we use the `transform!` function to create a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for all rows.\n\nPlease note that this function uses Julia's DataFrames package, so make sure to install it using `] add DataFrames` in the Julia REPL before running the function.","status":200,"tokens":[108,273],"elapsed":16.80559125,"cost":9.156000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":546823231,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
