Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

This function assumes that you're using the DataFrames package.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Create a new column 'audi_a4_type' that equals `true` across all rows\n    transform!(filtered_df, :manufacturer => ByRow(x -> true) => :audi_a4_type)\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function works by first filtering the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it transforms the DataFrame by adding a new column 'audi_a4_type' where every row is set to true.","status":200,"tokens":[108,284],"elapsed":17.612479375,"cost":9.464000000000002e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-218195836,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
