Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's the function `audi_filter` that performs the required operations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter the DataFrame for rows with manufacturer 'audi' and model 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'\n    filtered_df = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & ((df_cars['model'] == 'a4') | (df_cars['model'] == 'a4 quattro'))]\n    \n    # Create a new column 'audi_a4_type' with the value 'true' for all rows\n    filtered_df['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    # Return the filtered DataFrame\n    return filtered_df\n```\n\nYou can use this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n\n```python\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will result in a new DataFrame `filtered_df` that contains only the rows matching the specified criteria and with the additional `audi_a4_type` column set to `True`.","status":200,"tokens":[147,272],"elapsed":17.864248208,"cost":9.674e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1637522122,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
