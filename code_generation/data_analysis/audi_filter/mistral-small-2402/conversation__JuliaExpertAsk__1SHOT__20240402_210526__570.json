Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that does what you asked:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && row.model ∈ audi_models, df_cars)\n    transform!(filtered_df, :audi_a4_type => (x -> true) => :audi_a4_type)\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for all rows using the `transform!` function. Finally, it returns the filtered and modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[148,214],"elapsed":2.380612708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1294289809,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
