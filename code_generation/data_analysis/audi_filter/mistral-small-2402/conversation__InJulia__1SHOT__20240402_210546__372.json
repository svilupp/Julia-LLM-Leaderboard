It then adds a new column to the filtered DataFrame called `audi_a4_type` and sets its value to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,267],"elapsed":3.512575167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1488260146,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
