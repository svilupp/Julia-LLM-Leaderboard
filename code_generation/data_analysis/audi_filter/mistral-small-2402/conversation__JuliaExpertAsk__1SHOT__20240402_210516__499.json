Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    filtered_df = df_cars[(df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ audi_models), :]\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type = true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines the desired Audi models. It then filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is one of the desired models. It creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[148,186],"elapsed":2.594220708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1089001027,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
