Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    audi_rows = df_cars[(df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ audi_models), :]\n    audi_rows.audi_a4_type = true\n    return audi_rows\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the `manufacturer` column is equal to \"audi\" and the `model` column is one of \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame and sets its value to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered and modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[148,212],"elapsed":2.402550209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1167277414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
