Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    filtered_df = df_cars[df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\" .& df_cars.model .∈ audi_models, :]\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type = true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines the audi models of interest as a vector `audi_models`. It then filters the input dataframe `df_cars` to include only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is one of the audi models. The resulting filtered dataframe is then assigned a new column `audi_a4_type` with all entries set to `true`. The function finally returns the filtered and modified dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[148,207],"elapsed":2.55940725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1540302048,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
