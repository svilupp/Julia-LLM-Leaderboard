Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_models = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    filtered_df = df_cars[(df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ audi_models), :]\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type .= true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first creates a vector of the desired Audi models. It then filters the input DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is one of the Audi models in the vector. The resulting DataFrame is then modified to include a new column `audi_a4_type` that is set to `true` for all rows. The filtered and modified DataFrame is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[148,224],"elapsed":2.794665583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":405184026,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
