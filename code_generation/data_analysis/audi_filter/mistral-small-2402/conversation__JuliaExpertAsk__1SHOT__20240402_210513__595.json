Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Assuming that the `DataFrame` is from the `DataFrames.jl` package and the input is case-insensitive, here's a concise solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    filter_condition = (lowercase.(df_cars.manufacturer) .== \"audi\") &\n                       (lowercase.(df_cars.model) .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n\n    df_cars[filter_condition, :] = @transform!(df_cars, :, audi_a4_type = true)\n\n    return df_cars[filter_condition, :]\nend\n```\n\nThis function first creates a filter condition to select the rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" (case-insensitive). Then it applies the filter and creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for the selected rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nPlease replace the `df_cars` argument with the actual DataFrame you're working with.","status":200,"tokens":[148,274],"elapsed":3.020985458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":720777310,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
