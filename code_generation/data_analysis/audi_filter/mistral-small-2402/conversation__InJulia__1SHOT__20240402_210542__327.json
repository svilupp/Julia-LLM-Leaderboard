Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

For example:\n```\nfiltered_cars = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame containing only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", and with a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[107,297],"elapsed":3.29985775,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":397237681,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
