[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column to this filtered DataFrame called `audi_a4_type` and sets the value of this column to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,272],"elapsed":1.956233959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2145051000,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
