Then, we create a new column `audi_a4_type` in the filtered DataFrame and set all values to `true`. Finally, we return the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,226],"elapsed":4.304674458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-46440265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
