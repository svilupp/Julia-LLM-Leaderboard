Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column to this filtered DataFrame, `audi_a4_type`, and sets the value of this column to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,227],"elapsed":2.907437833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":584253013,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
