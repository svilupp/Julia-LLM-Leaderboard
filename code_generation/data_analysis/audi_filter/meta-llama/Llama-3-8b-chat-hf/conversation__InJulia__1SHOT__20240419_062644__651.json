We use the dot notation to access the columns of the DataFrame and the `&` operator to perform element-wise logical AND. The `|` operator is used to perform element-wise logical OR.\n\nThen, we create a new column `audi_a4_type` in the filtered DataFrame `df_audi_a4` and assign it the value `true` for all rows. Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[106,278],"elapsed":1.984956459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1691671322,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
