We use the dot notation to access the columns of the DataFrame, e.g. `df_cars.manufacturer`.\n2. We use the `&` operator to perform element-wise logical AND between two arrays, which is equivalent to filtering the DataFrame to only include rows where both conditions are true.\n3. We use the `|` operator to perform element-wise logical OR between two arrays, which is equivalent to filtering the DataFrame to only include rows where either condition is true.\n4. We use the `!` operator to create a new column in the DataFrame, and assign it the value `true` across all rows.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n    manufacturer = [\"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\"],\n    model = [\"a4\", \"camry\", \"a4 quattro\", \"f-150\", \"a4\"]\n)\n\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\nprintln(filtered_df)\n```\nThis should output the filtered DataFrame with the new column `audi_a4_type`:\n```\n| manufacturer | model    | audi_a4_type |\n|--------------|----------|--------------|\n| audi         | a4       | true         |\n| audi         | a4 quattro| true         |\n| audi         | a4       | true         |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,436],"elapsed":2.640089125,"cost":8.908e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1922587242,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
