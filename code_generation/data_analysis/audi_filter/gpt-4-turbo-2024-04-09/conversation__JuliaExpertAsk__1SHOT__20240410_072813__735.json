Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

After filtering, it adds a new column that flags all resultant rows as true for the specified condition. This function assumes that you have Julia installed with DataFrames.jl package available. If not, you can install it using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[137,216],"elapsed":9.506300667,"cost":0.007850000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":564559342,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
