Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It filters the rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n2. It adds a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets its value to `true` in all the filtered rows.\n\nThis will return a modified DataFrame containing only the desired rows with the specified conditions and an extra column indicating these are rows of Audi A4 types. Make sure that the `DataFrames` package is included in your environment to use the functionality demonstrated here.","status":200,"tokens":[137,245],"elapsed":11.606194792,"cost":0.00872,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1680710799,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
