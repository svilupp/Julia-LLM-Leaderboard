Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The function uses the `filter` function from the DataFrames package to select the desired rows, and then adds a new column using the `.!` operator to assign a value to all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[140,223],"elapsed":2.775425583,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1558442274,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
