Define a function `audi_filter` that takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as its argument.\n2.  Inside the function, use the filtering syntax for DataFrames to get the rows where the manufacturer is equal to \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The `.==` operator is vectorized, checking each element of the vector, and the `.&` operator is used for element-wise AND operation between the two vectors.\n3.  Create a new column `audi_a4_type` in the filtered DataFrame using the assignment syntax `audis[:, :audi_a4_type] .= true`.\n\nNote that the use of dot notation (`.`) is allowed in Julia for certain functions or operators to indicate element-wise application.","status":200,"tokens":[105,326],"elapsed":1.285259958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":850972240,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
