Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then we need to create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code needed\nWe can define a function `audi_filter` that takes the DataFrame `df_cars` as an input. The function will perform the filtering and return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df)\n    filter!(x -> x.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (x.model == \"a4\" || x.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\nWe can solve the task by calling the `audi_filter` function with the provided DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\nmodel=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nStep 4: Check that the solution is correct\nThe resulting DataFrame `result` should have only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", with an additional `true` column. We can verify:\n\n```julia\nprintln(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[286,396],"elapsed":12.206219375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-911918956,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
