Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function filter should be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame, manufacturer_col::Symbol, model_col::Symbol)\n    filter!(row -> (row[!, manufacturer_col] == \"audi\") && (row[!, model_col] in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    df_cars_new = df_cars\n    df_cars_new[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_cars_new  \nend\n\n# usage\ndf_cars_result = audi_filter(df_cars, :manufacturer, :model)\nprint(df_cars_result)\n```\n\nNote: The expression that defines the filter is ` (row[!, manufacturer_col] == \"audi\") && (row[!, model_col] in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])`. First it checks if the `manufacturer` column equals “audi”, and if the `model` is one of “a4” or “a4 quattro”. `filter!` will modify the DataFrame but preserve the column names. Following that, a DataFrame `df_cars_new` is created and a new column `audi_a4_type` of `true` boolean values is added to it. The function will return `df_cars_new`.\n\n\nLet me know if you need anything else.","status":200,"tokens":[140,276],"elapsed":8.63465375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1561462412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
