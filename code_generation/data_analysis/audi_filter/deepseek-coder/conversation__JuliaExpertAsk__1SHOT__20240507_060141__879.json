Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Python function `audi_filter` that solves the problem using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter dataframe to only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_cars = df_cars[(df_cars[\"manufacturer\"] == \"audi\") & \n                      (df_cars[\"model\"].isin([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]))]\n\n    # Create a new column \"audi_a4_type\" with value True\n    df_cars[\"audi_a4_type\"] = True\n\n    return df_cars\n```\n\nIn this function, we first filter the dataframe `df_cars` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` column is equal to \"audi\" and the `model` column is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then we create a new column `audi_a4_type` and set its value to True for all rows in the dataframe.\n\nPlease make sure to replace `df_cars` with your DataFrame and `manufacturer` and `model` with your actual column names if they are different.","status":200,"tokens":[159,290],"elapsed":14.908867125,"cost":0.00010346000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1308684900,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
