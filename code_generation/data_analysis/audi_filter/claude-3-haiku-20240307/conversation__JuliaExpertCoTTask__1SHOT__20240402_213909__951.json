I first think through the approach, which is to filter the DataFrame to only include the relevant rows and then create a new column with the desired values.\n2. I then write the necessary functions and code to implement this approach. I use the boolean indexing to filter the DataFrame and assign the `true` values to the new column.\n3. I solve the task by returning the resulting DataFrame.\n4. Finally, I check the solution by printing the resulting DataFrame, which should match the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[310,564],"elapsed":5.494884209,"cost":0.0007825,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-21979,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
