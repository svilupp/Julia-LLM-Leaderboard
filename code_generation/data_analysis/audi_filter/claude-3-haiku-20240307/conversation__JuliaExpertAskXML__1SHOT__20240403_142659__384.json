Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Use boolean indexing to filter the DataFrame to only rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n2. Add the new `audi_a4_type` column and set all its values to `true`.\n3.
