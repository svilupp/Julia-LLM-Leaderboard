Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

I'm using the DataFrames package in Julia, which is a popular choice for handling data frames.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter the dataframe based on manufacturer and model\n    filtered_df = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n\n    # Add a new column to the filtered dataframe\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the input data frame `df_cars` based on the conditions you provided. It then adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered data frame, with `true` as the value for all rows. Finally, it returns the filtered data frame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,220],"elapsed":5.086847333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1333033433,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
