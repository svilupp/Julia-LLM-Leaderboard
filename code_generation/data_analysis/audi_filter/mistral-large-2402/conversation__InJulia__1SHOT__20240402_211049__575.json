Here's a simple function that should do what you're asking for. I'm assuming you're using the DataFrames.jl package.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter the dataframe based on the conditions\n    filtered_df = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n\n    # Add a new column with true values\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame and sets all its values to `true`. Finally, it returns the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,246],"elapsed":8.179263667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1182266118,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
