I'm using the DataFrames package in Julia, which is a popular choice for handling data frames.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter the dataframe based on manufacturer and model\n    filtered_df = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n\n    # Add a new column with true values\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the data frame `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered data frame and sets all values in this column to `true`. Finally, it returns the filtered data frame.","status":200,"tokens":[107,239],"elapsed":6.426043166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1998468996,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
