Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter the dataframe based on the conditions\n    filtered_df = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => x -> x in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"], df_cars)\n\n    # Add a new column with true values\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type = true\n\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the DataFrame `df_cars` based on the conditions that the `manufacturer` should be \"audi\" and the `model` should be either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame and assigns `true` to all rows in this column. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[328,234],"elapsed":5.903088584,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1567290716,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
