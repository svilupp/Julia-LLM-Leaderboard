Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It creates a boolean filter condition using `.==` and `.∈` to select rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n2. It applies the filter condition to the input DataFrame using `view` to create a filtered view `filtered_df` without copying the data.\n3. It adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to `filtered_df` and assigns the value `true` to all rows in this column.\n4. It returns the filtered DataFrame `filtered_df` with the added column.\n\nNote that `view` is used instead of indexing to avoid copying the data unnecessarily, which can be more efficient for large DataFrames.","status":200,"tokens":[148,290],"elapsed":6.878712917,"cost":0.004794,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20370,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
