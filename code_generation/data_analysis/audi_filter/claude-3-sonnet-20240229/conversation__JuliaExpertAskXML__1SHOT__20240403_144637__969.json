Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It creates a boolean vector `audi_a4_filter` using broadcasting `.` to filter for rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n\n2. It then uses this boolean vector to subset the original DataFrame `df_cars` and create a new DataFrame `audi_a4_df` containing only the desired rows.\n\n3. Finally, it uses the `transform` function to add a new column `audi_a4_type` to `audi_a4_df`, with the value `true` for all rows. The `ByRow` function is used to apply the `identity` function (which returns its argument unchanged) to each row, effectively creating a constant column with the value `true`.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame `audi_a4_df` contains only the Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models, with an additional column `audi_a4_type` indicating that these are indeed the desired models.","status":200,"tokens":[148,363],"elapsed":7.782990542,"cost":0.005889,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-30017,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
