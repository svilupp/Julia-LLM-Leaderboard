Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution to filter the DataFrame to include only Audi models \"a4\" and \"a4 quattro\", and add a new column \"audi_a4_type\" with value true for those rows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    audi_a4_filter = (df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n    df_filtered = df_cars[audi_a4_filter, :]\n    transform(df_filtered, :audi_a4_type => true)\nend\n```\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. We filter the DataFrame `df_cars` using a boolean condition to keep only rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The condition is created using element-wise operations and the `.∈` operator to check if the model is in the given list.\n\n2. We create a new DataFrame `df_filtered` by slicing `df_cars` with the boolean filter condition.\n\n3. We use the `transform` function from DataFrames.jl to add a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` across all rows of `df_filtered`.\n\n4. The resulting DataFrame is returned.\n\nTo test it:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n                    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe resulting `filtered_df` will have 4 rows and 3 columns, with the \"audi_a4_type\" column having true for the rows with \"a4\" and \"a4 quattro\" models.","status":200,"tokens":[310,492],"elapsed":10.211432458,"cost":0.00831,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11913,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
