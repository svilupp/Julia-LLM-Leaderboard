We filter the original DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and the `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" using `filter`.\n2. We create a new column `:audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all rows using `transform`.\n3. The resulting filtered and transformed DataFrame is returned.\n\nThis function assumes the input DataFrame `df_cars` has columns `:manufacturer` and `:model`.","status":200,"tokens":[148,204],"elapsed":4.967871167,"cost":0.003504,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16745,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
