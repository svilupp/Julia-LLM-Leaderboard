The `@<?` syntax is a convenient way to chain operations on a DataFrame.\n\nThe `transform` function is then used to add a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered DataFrame. The `ByRow(identity)` call creates a row-wise operation that returns `true` for every row (since the `identity` function just returns its argument). This `true` value is then assigned to the new `audi_a4_type` column.\n\nFinally, the resulting filtered and transformed DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[148,262],"elapsed":6.680952834,"cost":0.004374,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":2311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
