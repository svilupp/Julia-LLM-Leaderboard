The `combine` function is then used to apply the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows) to each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and the row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[94,109],"elapsed":2.579692916,"cost":0.0019169999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-1961,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
