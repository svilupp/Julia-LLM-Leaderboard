The `model_counts` DataFrame is returned by the function.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe resulting `model_counts` DataFrame will have two columns: `model` and `count`, where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding row count in the original `df_cars` DataFrame.\n\nFor example, if `df_cars` looks like this:\n\n```\nmodel  year  price\nToyota 2020  25000\nHonda  2019  22000\nToyota 2021  28000\nFord   2018  20000\nHonda  2020  24000\n```\n\nThen `model_counts` will be:\n\n```\nmodel  count\nToyota 2\nHonda  2\nFord   1\n```\n\nThis function is useful for quickly getting an overview of the distribution of models in your data.","status":200,"tokens":[52,458],"elapsed":8.756074125,"cost":0.007026,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7107,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
