By passing `nrow` to `combine`, we get the row count for each group.\n4. The `nrow => :count` part renames the resulting column to `:count`.\n\nSo, the function groups the input DataFrame by the `:model` column, counts the number of rows in each group, and returns a new DataFrame with the `:model` and `:count` columns.","status":200,"tokens":[190,356],"elapsed":7.298912875,"cost":0.00591,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
