The `combine` function is then used to apply the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows) to each group, and the result is assigned to a new column named `count`. The resulting DataFrame contains the unique values of `model` and the corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[89,137],"elapsed":3.655691542,"cost":0.002322,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30857,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
