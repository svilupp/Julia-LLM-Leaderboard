Here, `nrow` is a built-in function that counts the number of rows in each group.\n3. The resulting DataFrame `model_counts` contains the `model` column and a new column `:count` with the number of rows for each model.\n\nThe function returns the `model_counts` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[89,219],"elapsed":5.012456458,"cost":0.003552,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":9539,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
