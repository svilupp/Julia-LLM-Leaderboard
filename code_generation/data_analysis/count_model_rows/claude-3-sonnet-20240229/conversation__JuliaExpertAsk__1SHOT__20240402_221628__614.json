Then, the `combine` function is used to apply the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows) to each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: the `:model` column and a column with the row counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[89,129],"elapsed":2.983729334,"cost":0.002202,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6636,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
