The resulting `model_counts` DataFrame contains two columns: `:model` and `:count`, where `:count` holds the number of rows for each model.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\n# Example DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\"])\n\n# Call the function\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(model_counts)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼────────────────\n   1 │ Toyota      2\n   2 │ Honda       2\n   3 │ Ford        1\n```\n\nIn the output, you can see that the `model_counts` DataFrame has two rows, one for each unique model value, and the `:count` column shows the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[89,394],"elapsed":7.129150584,"cost":0.006177,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-19418,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
