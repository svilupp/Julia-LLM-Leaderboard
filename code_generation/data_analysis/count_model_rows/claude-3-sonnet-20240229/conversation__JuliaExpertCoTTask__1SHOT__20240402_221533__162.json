We group the DataFrame `df` by the `:model` column using `groupby`.\n2. For each group, we count the number of rows using the `nrow` function and rename it to `:count` using the `nrow => :count` syntax.\n3. `combine` combines the grouped data with the row counts.\n4. Finally, we sort the result by the `:count` column in descending order using `sort(gd, :count, rev=true)`.\n\nThe function returns a new DataFrame with the model names and the corresponding row counts, sorted in descending order by the counts.","status":200,"tokens":[190,321],"elapsed":7.422485708,"cost":0.005385,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5291,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
