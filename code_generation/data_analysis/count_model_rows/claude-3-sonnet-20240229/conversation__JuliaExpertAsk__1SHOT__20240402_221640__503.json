The `combine` function is then used to apply the `nrow` function (which returns the number of rows) to each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `:model` and the row counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[89,116],"elapsed":2.422618042,"cost":0.002007,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":1571,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
