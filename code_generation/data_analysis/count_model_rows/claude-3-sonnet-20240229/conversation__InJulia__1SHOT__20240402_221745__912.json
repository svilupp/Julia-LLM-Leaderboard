You can install it by running `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in the Julia REPL.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"])\n\n# Call the count_model_rows function\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼────────────────\n   1 │ Toyota      3\n   2 │ Honda       2\n   3 │ Ford        2\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 3 rows with the model \"Toyota\", 2 rows with the model \"Honda\", and 2 rows with the model \"Ford\" in the `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[52,530],"elapsed":9.530682625,"cost":0.008106,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21667,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
