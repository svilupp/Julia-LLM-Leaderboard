The resulting DataFrame `model_counts` contains two columns: `:model` and `:count`.\n\nYou can call this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `model_counts` DataFrame will have two columns: `:model` with the unique model names, and `:count` with the corresponding number of rows for each model.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the column name for the model is `:model`. If your column has a different name, you'll need to modify the `groupby` line accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[52,350],"elapsed":6.883354333,"cost":0.005406,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-29869,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
