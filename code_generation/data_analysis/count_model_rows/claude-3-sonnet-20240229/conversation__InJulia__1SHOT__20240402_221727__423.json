Here's an example function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the `count_model_rows` function works:\n\n1. `groupby(df_cars, :model)` groups the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. `combine(groupeddf, operation => newcolumnname)` is used to apply an operation (in this case, `nrow`) to each group of the grouped DataFrame. The `nrow` function simply counts the number of rows in each group.\n3. The result of `combine` is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` contains the number of rows for each model.\n\nYou can call the `count_model_rows` function like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `df_counts` DataFrame will have two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` contains the number of rows for each unique model in the original `df_cars` DataFrame.\n\nNote: Make sure you have imported the `DataFrames` package by running `using DataFrames` before using the `groupby` and `combine` functions.","status":200,"tokens":[52,350],"elapsed":7.660614958,"cost":0.005406,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16437,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
