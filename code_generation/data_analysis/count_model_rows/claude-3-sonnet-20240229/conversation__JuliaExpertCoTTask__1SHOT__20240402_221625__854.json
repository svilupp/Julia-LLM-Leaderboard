We use the `groupby` function to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. `combine` is used to apply the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows) to each group, storing the result in a new column named `count`.\n3. `sort!` is used to sort the resulting DataFrame by the `count` column in descending order.\n4. The sorted DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[190,272],"elapsed":5.168912875,"cost":0.0046500000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10879,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
