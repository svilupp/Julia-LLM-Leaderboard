We use the `groupby` function to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. Then, we use the `combine` function along with the `nrow` function to count the number of rows for each group.\n3. We sort the resulting DataFrame by the `count` column in descending order using `sort!`.\n4. Finally, we return the sorted DataFrame.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[190,290],"elapsed":6.719110792,"cost":0.00492,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11875,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
