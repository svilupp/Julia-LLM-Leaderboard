This will allow you to see which models have the most rows in the DataFrame.\n\nNote that this function assumes the `model` column exists in the DataFrame `df_cars`. If the column name is different, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[52,405],"elapsed":7.24790725,"cost":0.006231,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26496,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
