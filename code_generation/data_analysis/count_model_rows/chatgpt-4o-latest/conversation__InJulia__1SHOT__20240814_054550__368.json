Here's how you can write a function `count_model_rows` that groups data by the `model` column and counts the number of rows for each unique model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\n    return grouped_df\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`groupby(df_cars, :model)`**: This groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the values in the `model` column.\n- **`combine(groupby(...), nrow => :count)`**: This combines the grouped DataFrame by applying the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows in each group) and adding the result as a new column named `count`.\n\n### Usage Example:\nLet's assume you have the following DataFrame:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\"])\n```\n\nCalling the function:\n\n```julia\ncounted_df = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will produce a DataFrame `counted_df` that looks like this:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count\n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ Ford        3\n   2 │ Toyota      2\n   3 │ Honda       2\n```\n\nThis tells you that there are 3 rows with the model \"Ford\", 2 rows with \"Toyota\", and 2 rows with \"Honda\".","status":200,"tokens":[55,356],"elapsed":3.971684167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":382912017,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
