Here, we use `nrow`, which counts the number of rows in each group, and alias the result as `count`.\n- **result**: The resulting DataFrame that shows how many rows exist for each model.\n\n### Example Output:\n```julia\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count \n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ a4          3\n   2 │ a6          1\n   3 │ q7          1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[181,252],"elapsed":2.961676292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1737847699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
