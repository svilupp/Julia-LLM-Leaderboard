Here's how you can write a function `count_model_rows` that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group by the 'model' column\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each group\n    count_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)\n    \n    return count_df\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **groupby(df_cars, :model):** This groups the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. **combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count):** This combines the grouped DataFrame by counting the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame with a `model` column and a `count` column.\n\n### Example Use:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Ford\", \"Ford\"],\n                    price = [20000, 25000, 22000, 30000, 28000, 29000])\n\n# Call the function\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n```plaintext\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count\n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ Toyota      2\n   2 │ Honda       1\n   3 │ Ford        3\n```\n\nThis output indicates that \"Toyota\" appears 2 times, \"Honda\" appears 1 time, and \"Ford\" appears 3 times in the `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[55,388],"elapsed":4.354975958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1917334085,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
