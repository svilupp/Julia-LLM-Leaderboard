The `::DataFrame` annotation specifies the expected data type of the input argument.\n* **`groupvalues(df_cars, :model, count.(df_cars,))`**: This is the core of the function.  It uses the following:\n    * **`groupvalues(df_cars, :model)`**: Groups the DataFrame `df_cars` based on the values in the `:model` column. It creates unique groups for each distinct model.\n    * **`count.(df_cars,)`**: Calculates the number of rows in each group. The `.` notation applies the `count` function to each group.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n  model=[\"Toyota\" \"Honda\" \"Toyota\" \"Ford\" \"Honda\" \"Toyota\"],\n  year=[2020 2019 2021 2022 2020 2023],\n  # ... other columns as needed\n)\n\n# Count rows per model\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the results\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n  model\n  Toyota   3\n  Honda    2\n  Ford     1\n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or tasks!","status":200,"tokens":[59,427],"elapsed":1.085136292,"cost":9.72e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-376098075,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
