It uses the `groupby` function from the DataFrames package to group the rows of `df_cars` based on the values in the `:model` column.\n   - `groupby(df_cars, :model)`: This groups the DataFrame by the `:model` column.\n   - `sum((:num_rows),)`: For each group (i.e., each unique model), this calculates the sum of the values in a hypothetical column named `num_rows`. You can replace `:num_rows` with the actual column name in your DataFrame that you want to count.\n\n**How to use the function:**\n\n```julia\n# Assuming your DataFrame is named df_cars\n\ngrouped_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(grouped_counts) \n```\n\nThis will output a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and the count of rows belonging to that model.","status":200,"tokens":[59,349],"elapsed":0.943562541,"cost":8.16e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-874430249,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
