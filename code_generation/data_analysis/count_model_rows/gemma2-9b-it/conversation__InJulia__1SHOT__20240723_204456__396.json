It uses the `countbys` function from the DataFrames package. \n    - `df_cars` refers to the input DataFrame.\n    - `:model` specifies the column to group the data by (in this case, the \"model\" column).\n   - `countbys` automatically groups the DataFrame and counts the number of rows within each group, returning a new DataFrame with two columns: \n      - The group column (model)\n      - The count of rows for each group\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```julia\n# Assuming you have a DataFrame named df_cars\n# ... (Your DataFrame data)\n\n# Call the function to get the counts\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Display the results\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will output a new DataFrame showing the unique models from your `df_cars` DataFrame and the corresponding number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[59,349],"elapsed":0.923894375,"cost":8.16e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2032026382,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
