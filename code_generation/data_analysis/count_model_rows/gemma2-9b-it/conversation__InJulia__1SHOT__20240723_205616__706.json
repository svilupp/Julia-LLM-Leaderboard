It uses the `groupby` function to group the rows of `df_cars` based on the values in the `model` column. \n   -  `df_cars, :model` specifies that we want to group by the \"model\" column.\n   -  `@:count` tells `groupby` to calculate the number of rows (count) for each group. \n   - This function returns a grouped DataFrame with the model as a new key (left column) and the number of rows for that model as the count value.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. Make sure you have the `DataFrames.jl` package installed. If not, run `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in the Julia REPL.\n2. Create your DataFrame `df_cars`.\n3. Call the function: \n   ```julia\n   result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n   println(result) \n   ```\n   This will print a DataFrame showing the distinct car models and the corresponding number of rows for each model.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need help with a specific example!","status":200,"tokens":[59,390],"elapsed":1.015182875,"cost":8.98e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1098807460,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
