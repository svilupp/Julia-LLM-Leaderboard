This effectively counts the number of rows in each group.\n\n4. **`return ...`**:  The function returns the resulting grouped DataFrame, where the rows are now grouped by `model` and each group has a new column named `:count` containing the row count for that model.\n\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Make sure you have the DataFrames package installed.**\n   ```julia\n   Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")  \n   ```\n\n2. **Create your DataFrame `df_cars`:**\n\n   ```julia\n   df_cars = DataFrame(\n       model = [\"Civic\" \"Accord\" \"Camry\" \"Civic\" \"Corolla\"],\n       year = [2020 2021 2022 2023 2022],\n       price = [25000.0 30000.0 28000.0 26000.0 27000.0] \n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Call the function:**\n   ```julia\n   result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n   println(result)\n   ```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[59,495],"elapsed":1.235604125,"cost":0.0001108,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2030157508,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
