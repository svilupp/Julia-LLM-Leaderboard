Use `groupby(df_cars, :model)` to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. Then use `combine` to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group.\n\nThis provides a concise and efficient way to count the number of rows for each model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[224,326],"elapsed":3.26542575,"cost":0.00046350000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11677,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
