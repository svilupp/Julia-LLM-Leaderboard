Use `groupby` to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. Get the length of each group to count the number of rows.\n3. Return the results as a DataFrame with the model names and their corresponding counts.\n\nThis solution will work for the given example data and can be generalized to any DataFrame with a `model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[224,283],"elapsed":2.7685725,"cost":0.00040975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19883,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
