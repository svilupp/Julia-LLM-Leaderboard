Use `groupby` to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. Use `combine` to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group.\n3. The result is a new DataFrame with the model names and the count of rows for each model.\n\nThis solution is concise and efficient, and it will work for any DataFrame with a `model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[224,219],"elapsed":2.309014458,"cost":0.00032975,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-22459,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
