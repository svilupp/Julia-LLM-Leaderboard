The function `count_model_rows` takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column.\n3. Then, we use the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` (number of rows) function to each group, and assign the result to the `:count` column.\n4. The resulting DataFrame `model_counts` contains the count of rows for each unique model.\n5. Finally, we return the `model_counts` DataFrame.\n\nIn the example usage, we create the `df_cars` DataFrame and pass it to the `count_model_rows` function, which outputs the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[190,361],"elapsed":3.985436791,"cost":0.0004987500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-11517,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
