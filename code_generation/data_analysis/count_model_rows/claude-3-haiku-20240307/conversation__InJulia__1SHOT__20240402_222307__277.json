We use the `groupby()` function from the DataFrames package to group the rows of the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. We then use the `combine()` function to apply the `nrow()` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group. The resulting column is named `count`.\n3. Finally, we use the `sort()` function to sort the resulting DataFrame by the `count` column in descending order.\n\nYou can call this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota Corolla\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Toyota Camry\", \"Honda Accord\", \"Toyota Corolla\"])\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will output a DataFrame with the count of rows for each unique model, sorted in descending order:\n\n```\n  model           count\n1 Toyota Corolla    2\n2 Honda Civic       1\n3 Toyota Camry      1\n4 Honda Accord      1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[52,401],"elapsed":4.572528916,"cost":0.0005142500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-6383,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
