Use `groupby` to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. Then use `combine` to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group.\n3. This returns a new DataFrame with the model names and their corresponding row counts.\n\nThe solution is correct based on the provided example data.","status":200,"tokens":[224,205],"elapsed":2.566304125,"cost":0.00031225000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30988,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
