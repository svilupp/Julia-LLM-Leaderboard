Then, it calculates the size of each group using the `size` function, which gives the number of rows for each model. Finally, it converts the result into a dictionary with the model as the key and the count as the value.","status":200,"tokens":[190,349],"elapsed":4.366690292,"cost":0.0004837500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28330,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
