Use the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column.\n2. Then use the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which will count the number of rows for each model.\n\nThis returns a DataFrame with the unique model values and the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[224,199],"elapsed":2.153261333,"cost":0.00030475,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":27645,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
