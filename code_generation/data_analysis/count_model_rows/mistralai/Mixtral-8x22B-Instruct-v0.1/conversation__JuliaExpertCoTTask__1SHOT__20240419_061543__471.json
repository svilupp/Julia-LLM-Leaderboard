Then, it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with the `model` column and a `count` column that shows the number of rows for each model.\n\nThe output of the example usage will be:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ a4         3\n   2 │ a6         1\n   3 │ q7         1\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 3 rows with the model \"a4\", 1 row with the model \"a6\", and 1 row with the model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[214,338],"elapsed":5.185131209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1457916394,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
