Then it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` is the number of rows for each model.\n\nPlease make sure to have the `DataFrames` package installed and loaded in your Julia environment before running this function. You can install it using the package manager by running `]add DataFrames` in the Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[61,219],"elapsed":5.200965375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1127612533,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
