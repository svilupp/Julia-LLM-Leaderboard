Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping the DataFrame by the `model` column using the `groupby` function, and then applying the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows. The `combine` function is used to apply the `nrow` function to each group.\n\nWhen you run `count_model_rows(df_cars)`, you should get a DataFrame that shows the count of each car model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[205,219],"elapsed":5.015137917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-776478887,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
