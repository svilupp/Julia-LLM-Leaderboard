In Julia, you can use the `DataFrames` package to work with data frames. Here's a function that does what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group the data frame by the 'model' column\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n\n    # Calculate the number of rows for each group\n    count_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow)\n\n    # Rename the count column for clarity\n    rename!(count_df, :nrow => :row_count)\n\n    return count_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the data frame `df_cars` by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. Then, it uses the `combine` function with `nrow` to calculate the number of rows in each group. Finally, it renames the count column to `row_count` for clarity. You can call this function with your data frame as the argument to get the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[52,258],"elapsed":6.151362667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":728455706,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
