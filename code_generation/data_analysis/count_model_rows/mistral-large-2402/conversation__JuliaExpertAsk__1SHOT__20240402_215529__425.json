The result is a new DataFrame where the first column is the unique `model` values and the second column is the number of rows for each `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[94,139],"elapsed":3.809776917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1900663425,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
