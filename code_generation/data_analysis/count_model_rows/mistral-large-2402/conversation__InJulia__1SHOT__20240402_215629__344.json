In Julia, you can use the `DataFrames` package to work with data frames. Here's a function that groups a data frame by the `model` column and counts the number of rows for each unique model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first grouping `df_cars` by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. Then, it applies the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows. The `combine` function is used to perform this operation. The result is a new data frame where the first column is the unique `model` values and the second column is the number of rows for each `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[52,198],"elapsed":4.979909625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1731845568,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
