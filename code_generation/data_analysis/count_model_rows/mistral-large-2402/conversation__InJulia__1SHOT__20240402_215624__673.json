Here's a simple way to do it using the DataFrames and Combine packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Combine\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. Then, it applies the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows. The `combine` function is used to perform this operation. The result is a new DataFrame where the first column is the unique `model` values and the second column is the number of rows for each `model`.\n\nPlease make sure that the `model` column is of a type that can be used for grouping (like String or Symbol). If it's not, you might need to convert it before calling `count_model_rows`.\n\nRemember to install the necessary packages by using `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` and `Pkg.add(\"Combine\")` if you haven't done so already.","status":200,"tokens":[52,274],"elapsed":7.036567375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1258921405,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
