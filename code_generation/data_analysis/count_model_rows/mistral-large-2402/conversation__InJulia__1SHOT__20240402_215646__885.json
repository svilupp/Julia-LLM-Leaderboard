In Julia, you can use the `DataFrames` package to manipulate dataframes. Here's a function that groups a dataframe by the `model` column and counts the number of rows for each unique model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby(df_cars, :model)` groups the dataframe `df_cars` by the `model` column. The `combine` function is then used with `nrow` to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a new dataframe with the unique models and their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[52,181],"elapsed":4.700154875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-308382334,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
