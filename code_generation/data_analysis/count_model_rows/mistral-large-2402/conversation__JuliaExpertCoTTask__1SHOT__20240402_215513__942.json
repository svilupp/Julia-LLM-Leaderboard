Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column using the `groupby` function, and then applying the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows. The `combine` function is used to apply `nrow` to each group and return a new DataFrame with the results. When you run this code with the provided `df_cars` DataFrame, it will print:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   nrow\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ a4          3\n   2 │ a6          1\n   3 │ q7          1\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 3 rows with `model` equal to \"a4\", 1 row with \"a6\", and 1 row with \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[205,319],"elapsed":9.497319625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1390776189,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
