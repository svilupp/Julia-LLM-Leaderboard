The result is a new DataFrame where the first column is the unique `:model` values and the second column is the number of rows for each `:model`.","status":200,"tokens":[94,145],"elapsed":3.776498,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1402564268,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
