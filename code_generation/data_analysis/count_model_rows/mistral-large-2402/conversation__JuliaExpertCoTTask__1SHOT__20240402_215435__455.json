Think through your approach step by step:\n   - We need to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n   - Then, we count the number of rows in each group.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe output should be a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `nrow`. The `nrow` column should contain the count of each model in the original `df_cars` DataFrame. For example:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   nrow\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ a4          3\n   2 │ a6          1\n   3 │ q7          1\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 3 rows with model `a4`, 1 row with model `a6`, and 1 row with model `q7`.","status":200,"tokens":[205,341],"elapsed":8.291788042,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1633446809,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
