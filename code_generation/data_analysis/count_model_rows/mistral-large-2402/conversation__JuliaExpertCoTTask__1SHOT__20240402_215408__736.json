Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Your data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# Function to count rows for each model\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n\n# Call the function\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function works by grouping the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column using the `groupby` function, and then applying the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows. The `combine` function is used to apply the `nrow` function to each group. The result is a new DataFrame with each unique model and the corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[205,219],"elapsed":6.401115792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1742499199,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
