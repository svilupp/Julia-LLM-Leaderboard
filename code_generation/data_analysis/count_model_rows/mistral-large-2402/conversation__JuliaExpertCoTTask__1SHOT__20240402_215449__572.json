The `combine` function is used to perform this operation. The result is a new DataFrame where the first column is the unique `model` values and the second column is the number of rows for each `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[205,189],"elapsed":5.489758084,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1914421978,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
