Here is the function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    by_model = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = Dict{eltype(df_cars[:model]), Int}()\n    for subdf in by_model\n        model = first(subdf[:model])\n        counts[model] = size(subdf, 1)\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the DataFrame by the `model` column, then calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is returned as a dictionary, where each key is a model and each value is the number of corresponding rows.","status":200,"tokens":[60,198],"elapsed":11.111084292,"cost":6.384000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1298758860,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
