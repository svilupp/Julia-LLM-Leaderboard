Then it applies the `nrow` function (which counts the number of rows in each group) to each group and combines the results in a new DataFrame.\n\nRemember to add `using DataFrames` at the start of your script to import the DataFrames package if you haven't done so already.","status":200,"tokens":[101,170],"elapsed":8.018886375,"cost":6.174e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1296942758,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
