Here is how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return by(df, :model, df -> size(df, 1))\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- `by(df, :model, df -> size(df, 1))` groups `df` by the column `model`, and for each group calculates the number of rows using `size(df, 1)`.\n\nThe result is a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `x1`, where `model` contains the unique model names and `x1` is the count of rows for each model.\n\nIf you want the result as a Dictionary, you can modify the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return Dict(zip(df[:model], size(df, 1)))\nend\n```\n\nThis version of the function returns a Dictionary where the keys are model names and the values are the row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[60,274],"elapsed":11.679940041,"cost":8.512000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1510587577,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
