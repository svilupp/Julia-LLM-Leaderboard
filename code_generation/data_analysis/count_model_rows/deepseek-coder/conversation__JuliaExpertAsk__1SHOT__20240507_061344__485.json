Here is a function that does exactly that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return by(df_cars, :model, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `by` function from `DataFrames.jl` to group the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column and calculate the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function.\n\nRemember to include `DataFrames` package which isn't part of the Julia standard library, so you might need to install it first. You can add it in your environment with the following command:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[101,188],"elapsed":8.153305167,"cost":6.678000000000001e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1743777345,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
