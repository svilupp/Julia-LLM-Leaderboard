Here is the function `count_model_rows` in Python using pandas library.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    return df_cars.groupby('model').count()\n```\nThis function will return a new DataFrame where model names are indices and there is a column 'count' which tells the number of rows for each model.\n\nPlease ensure that your DataFrame `df_cars` has column 'model'. If you want to get the count of another column than the index, you may change 'count' to the appropriate column name.\n\nAlso, please note that for this function to work correctly, your 'model' column should not have any NaN values. If there are missing 'model' values, you can either remove those rows or fill them with a specific value before applying this function using `dropna()` or `fillna()` function respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[101,239],"elapsed":16.921343125,"cost":8.106e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1315839203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
