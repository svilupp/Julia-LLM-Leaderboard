We call `count_model_rows` function with this DataFrame and print the result, which should be a series showing the count of each model in the given DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[101,203],"elapsed":11.413036625,"cost":7.098e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":958560933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
