Here's how you can create the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nHere's what the function does:\n\n1. `groupby(df, :model)` groups the DataFrame `df` by the column `model`. \n\n2. `combine()` then applies a function to each group. Here, `nrow => :count` means apply the function `nrow` (which counts the number of rows) to each group and store the result in a new column named `count`.\n\nYou can use the function `count_model_rows` like this:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model = repeat([\"Fiesta\", \"Civic\", \"Corolla\", \"Accord\"], inner=3),\n               price = rand(4:10, 12),\n               mileage = rand(1000:30000, 12),\n               year = rand(2000:2022, 12))\n\ncount_df = count_model_rows(df)\n```\n\nThe result is a DataFrame `count_df` with a single column `count` that displays the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[60,356],"elapsed":20.118023292,"cost":0.00010808000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-695944930,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
