If you haven't installed it yet, you can do it with the following command:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\n\nThen load it with:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n```\n\nHere is a function `count_model_rows` that does exactly what you asked for:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    result = by(df_cars, :model, nrow)\n    result_df = DataFrame(model = result[1], count = result[2])\n    return result_df\nend\n```\n\n`by` groups the dataframe by `:model` and then applies a function to each group. `nrow` is the function applied to each group, which returns the number of rows, just what we want. The result is then converted back into a DataFrame for clarity.\n\nLet us break it down:\n\n- `by(df_cars, :model, nrow)` – here is your data frame df_cars by column `:model` and we are applying the `nrow` function to count the number of rows per each group.\n- `result_df = DataFrame(model = result[1], count = result[2])` – creating a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`. The `model` column contains the names of the models in the original data frame, and the `count` column contains the corresponding counts of rows for each model.\n- `return result_df` – return the new DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[60,373],"elapsed":16.634269875,"cost":0.00011284000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1077988399,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
