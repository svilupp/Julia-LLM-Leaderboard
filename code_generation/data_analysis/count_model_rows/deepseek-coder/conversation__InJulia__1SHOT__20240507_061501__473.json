Here is how you can do this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return nrow.(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n\n#assuming you have a DataFrame df_cars\n#df_cars = DataFrame(model = repeat(1:2, inner = 5), some_column = rand(10))\n\n#example:\n#count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn the function `count_model_rows`, the `groupby` function is used to group the data by the `model` column. The `nrow` function is applied to each of these groups to count the number of rows.\n\nPlease note I commented out the `DataFrame df_cars` definition, you need to define `df_cars` as per your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[60,214],"elapsed":11.724173459,"cost":6.832e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1144385801,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
