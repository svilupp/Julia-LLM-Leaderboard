Here's how you could define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    return combine(grouped, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the rows of `df_cars` by the `model` column and then counts the number of rows in each group. The `combine` function is used along with `nrow` to calculate the row count for each group. The result is a new DataFrame with each `model` and its associated count.","status":200,"tokens":[89,152],"elapsed":3.173595709,"cost":0.00545,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-376892130,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
