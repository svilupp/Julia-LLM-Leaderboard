Here's how you can write the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    count_rows = combine(grouped, n => nrow => :count)\n    return count_rows\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `groupby(df, :model)` groups the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column.\n- `combine(grouped, n => nrow => :count)` computes the number of rows for each group and stores the result in a new column called `count` in the resulting DataFrame.\n- The `count_rows` DataFrame is then returned, which contains each model and the corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[89,186],"elapsed":3.917056917,"cost":0.00647,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":658331454,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
