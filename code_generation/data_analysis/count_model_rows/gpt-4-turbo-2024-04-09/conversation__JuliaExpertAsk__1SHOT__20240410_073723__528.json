It then uses the `combine` function to count the number of rows in each group (each model in this case), creating a new column called `count` that contains these counts.","status":200,"tokens":[89,174],"elapsed":4.06466075,"cost":0.00611,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1259528152,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
