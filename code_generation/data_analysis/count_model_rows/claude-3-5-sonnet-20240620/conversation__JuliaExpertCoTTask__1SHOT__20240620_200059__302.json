Solve the task:\n   The function is now ready to use with the given data.\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   Let's test the function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count \n     │ String Int64 \n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ a4         3\n   2 │ a6         1\n   3 │ q7         1\n```\n\nThe function `count_model_rows` correctly groups the data by model and calculates the count for each model.
