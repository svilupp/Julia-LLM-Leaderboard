Groups the DataFrame by the `model` column\n2. Counts the number of rows for each group using `nrow`\n3. Returns a new DataFrame with columns `model` and `count`\n\nTo use it:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis approach uses DataFrames.jl's efficient grouping and combining operations.","status":200,"tokens":[89,150],"elapsed":2.532998584,"cost":0.002517,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4084,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
