Specifically, you can leverage the `groupby` and `combine` functions. Below is an example function `count_model_rows` that performs this task on the `model` column of the DataFrame `df_cars`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Combine the groups to count each occurrence of model\n    count_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)\n    \n    # Return the resulting DataFrame with counts\n    return count_df\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `groupby(df_cars, :model)`: Groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column.\n- `combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)`: Applies the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group. The result is stored in a new column named `count`.\n  \nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"BMW\", \"BMW\"])\ncount_df = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(count_df)\n```\n\nThis will output a DataFrame containing each unique model and its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[55,337],"elapsed":3.657084792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":720766196,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
