The result should look like this:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count \n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ a4        3\n   2 │ a6        1\n   3 │ q7        1\n```\n\nThis completes the task as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[181,321],"elapsed":4.16510625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1447207729,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
