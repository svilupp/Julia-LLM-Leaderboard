Here's how you can write the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define the function to count rows for each model\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    result = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **groupby(df_cars, :model)**:\n   - This function groups the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column.\n   \n2. **combine(..., nrow => :count)**:\n   - This function applies the `nrow` function to each group generated by `groupby`, calculating the number of rows in each group.\n   - The result is stored in a new column named `count`.\n\n3. **Return Value**:\n   - The function returns a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique `model` and includes a `count` column showing how many rows were in each group.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```julia\n# Example DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"])\n\n# Call the function\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Display the result\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output a DataFrame with each unique model and a count of the number of occurrences of each model in the original DataFrame:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count\n     │ String Int64\n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ A          3\n   2 │ B          2\n   3 │ C          1\n```\n\nYou would use this function on any DataFrame `df_cars` that contains a column named `model` as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[55,432],"elapsed":4.4292885,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":665636043,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
