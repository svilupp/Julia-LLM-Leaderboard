I decided to use the `groupby` and `count` functions to efficiently group and count the rows.\n\n2. **Write functions:** I defined a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input. It uses the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column and then applies the `count` function to each group to count the number of rows.\n\n3. **Solve the task:** I applied the `count_model_rows` function to the `df_cars` DataFrame. The function grouped the data by model and calculated the number of rows for each group, resulting in a new DataFrame with model groups and their corresponding row counts.\n\n4. **Check solution:** I printed the output of the function, which showed the model groups with their respective row counts. I verified that the solution accurately counted the number of rows for each model group, as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":22.049845375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-28940,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
