The function returns the `model_rows_count` dictionary.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe output of the function `count_model_rows` is a dictionary with the model as keys and the number of rows for each model as values. For example:\n\n```\nmodel\nToyota\n2\nHonda\n2\nBMW\n1\n```\n\nThis output shows that there are two rows for the Toyota and Honda models, and one row for the BMW model in the `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":18.363535875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-14535,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
