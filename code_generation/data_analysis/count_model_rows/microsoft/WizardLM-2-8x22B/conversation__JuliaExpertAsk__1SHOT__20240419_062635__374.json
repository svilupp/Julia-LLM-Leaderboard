The result is a DataFrame with two columns: `:model` and `:count`, where `:count` represents the number of rows for each model. The `|>` operator is used to pipe the grouped object directly into the `combine` function for cleaner code.","status":200,"tokens":[99,168],"elapsed":8.596573709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":697122316,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
