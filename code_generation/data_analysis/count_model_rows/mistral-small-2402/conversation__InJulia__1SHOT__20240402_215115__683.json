Here's a simple way to do it using the DataFrame and GroupBy packages in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, GroupBy\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    count_per_model = combine(grouped_df, nrow) # nrow is a function that counts the number of rows in each group\n    rename!(count_per_model, :x1 => :count) # We rename the column from :x1 to :count\n    return count_per_model\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument, groups it by the `model` column, and then calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique car model and the number of times it appears in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[52,226],"elapsed":2.704286833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2075880615,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
