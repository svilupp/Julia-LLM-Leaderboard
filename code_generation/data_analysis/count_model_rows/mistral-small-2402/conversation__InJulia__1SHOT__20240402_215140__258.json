It then creates an empty DataFrame to store the results.\n\nFor each group, it retrieves the model name and the number of rows in the sub-DataFrame, and pushes these values into the results DataFrame. Finally, it returns the results DataFrame.\n\nPlease ensure that the `DataFrames` package is installed and imported in your Julia environment before running this function. You can install it using the following command:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\n\nAnd then you can import it using:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n```","status":200,"tokens":[52,306],"elapsed":3.364683667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1450461495,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
