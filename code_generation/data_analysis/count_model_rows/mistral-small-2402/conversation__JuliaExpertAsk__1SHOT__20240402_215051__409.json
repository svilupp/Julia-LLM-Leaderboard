The `groupby` function is used to group the dataframe by the `model` column.\n2. The `combine` function is then used to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in the group.\n3. The resulting column is named `:nrow`, so we use the `rename!` function to rename it to `:count`.\n4. Finally, the function returns the dataframe with the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[94,242],"elapsed":2.8077575,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1798303337,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
