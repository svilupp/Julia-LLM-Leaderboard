The `length` function is used to count the number of rows for each group, and the dot notation (`.`) is used to broadcast the function over the grouped columns.\n\nTo use the function, pass your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame containing the `model` names and their counts.","status":200,"tokens":[94,241],"elapsed":5.085325375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1990868471,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
