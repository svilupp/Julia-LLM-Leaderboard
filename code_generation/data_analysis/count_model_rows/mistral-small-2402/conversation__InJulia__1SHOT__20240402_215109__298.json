The resulting DataFrame is then renamed to reflect that it contains the number of rows for each model, and returned.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"car1\", \"car1\", \"car2\", \"car2\", \"car2\", \"car3\"], other_column = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model    num_rows\n     │ String   Int64\n─────┼──────────────────\n   1 │ car1         2\n   2 │ car2         3\n   3 │ car3         1\n```\nAs you can see, the `count_model_rows` function correctly counts the number of rows for each `model` in the input `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[52,419],"elapsed":4.573082125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":922622590,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
