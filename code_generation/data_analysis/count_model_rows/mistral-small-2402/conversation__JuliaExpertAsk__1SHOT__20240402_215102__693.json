Then it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `:model` and the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[94,152],"elapsed":1.8190385,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":129809681,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
