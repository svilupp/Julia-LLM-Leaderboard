Then, it uses the `combine` function with the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group. Finally, it returns the new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and the corresponding row counts.\n\nMake sure to replace `df_cars` with your actual DataFrame when calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[94,218],"elapsed":2.431495708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1391196151,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
