The result is a new DataFrame with each unique `model` and the corresponding count.\n\nNote: You should have DataFrames.jl package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not installed, you can add it by using the command `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in the Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[52,199],"elapsed":1.49020725,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1331726376,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
