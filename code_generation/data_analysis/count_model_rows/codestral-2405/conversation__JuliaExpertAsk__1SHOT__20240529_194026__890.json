The result is a new dataframe where each row represents a unique model and the `count` column gives the number of rows in the original dataframe with that model.","status":200,"tokens":[94,158],"elapsed":1.149858459,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-375235727,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
