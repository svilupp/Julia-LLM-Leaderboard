It applies the `nrow` function (which calculates the number of rows in a group) to each group and stores the results in a new column called `number_of_rows`.\n- The function then returns the new DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame as an argument like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a different model in `df_cars` and the `number_of_rows` column tells you how many rows in `df_cars` have that model.","status":200,"tokens":[52,369],"elapsed":2.549852875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1501066282,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
