The `combine` function is then used to create a new DataFrame that contains the count of rows for each group. The `nrow` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group.","status":200,"tokens":[52,177],"elapsed":1.341264333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-874237995,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
