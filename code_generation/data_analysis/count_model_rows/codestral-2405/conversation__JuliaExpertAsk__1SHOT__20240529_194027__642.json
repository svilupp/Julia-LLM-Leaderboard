Then it uses the `combine` function with the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model and the `count` column indicates how many rows there are for that model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[94,189],"elapsed":1.3530895,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-260737089,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
