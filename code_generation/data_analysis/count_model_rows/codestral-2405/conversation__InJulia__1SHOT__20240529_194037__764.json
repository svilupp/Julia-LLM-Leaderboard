This function uses DataFrames.jl and StatisticFunctions.jl packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, StatisticFunctions\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group by model\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n\n    # Use combine function to count rows for each group\n    result_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)\n\n    return result_df\nend\n```\n\nThe function `groupby` separates the data frame into groups based on the `model` column. The `combine` function is then used to calculate the number of rows in each group (`nrow`) and stores these counts in a new column named `count`. The function then returns this new data frame.","status":200,"tokens":[52,215],"elapsed":1.550556375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1900783748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
