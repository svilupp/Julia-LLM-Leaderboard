In Julia, you can use the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl to group data by a specific column, and then use the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group. Here's a simple function that does that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group data by 'model' and calculate the number of rows in each group\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    return combine(grouped_df, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique `model` in `df_cars`, and the number of rows in `df_cars` that have that `model`. The new DataFrame will have two columns: `model` and `nrow`.","status":200,"tokens":[52,210],"elapsed":1.494995709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1291270677,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
