Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return by(df_cars, :model, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `by` function from the DataFrames package to group the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column. The `nrow` function is then applied to each group to count the number of rows in that group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique `model` value and the number of rows in `df_cars` that have that model value.","status":200,"tokens":[52,165],"elapsed":1.1914915,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":40160241,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
