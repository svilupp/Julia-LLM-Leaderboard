Then, it calculates the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function, which returns the number of rows in a DataFrame. Finally, it combines the grouped DataFrame with the counts into a new DataFrame and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[52,194],"elapsed":1.408280333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1853937529,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
