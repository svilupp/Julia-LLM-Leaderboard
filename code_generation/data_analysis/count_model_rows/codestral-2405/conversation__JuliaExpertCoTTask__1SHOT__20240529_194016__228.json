The `groupby` function is used to group the data, and the `combine` function with `nrow` is used to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique model and the `count` column shows the number of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[205,193],"elapsed":1.513483875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":843033021,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
