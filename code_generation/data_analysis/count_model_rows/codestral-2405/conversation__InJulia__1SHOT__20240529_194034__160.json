This function uses the DataFrames.jl and DataFramesMeta.jl packages, which you can install using the Julia package manager.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return @chain df_cars begin\n        groupby(:model)\n        combine(nrow)\n        rename(:nrow => :count)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the data by the `model` column and then calculates the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique car model and the `count` column indicates how many rows in `df_cars` have this model.\n\nThe `@chain` macro from DataFramesMeta.jl is used here for piping operations. It allows us to write the transformation of the DataFrame in a more readable way. Without this macro, the function would look like this:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    df_grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    df_count = combine(df_grouped, nrow)\n    df_renamed = rename(df_count, :nrow => :count)\n    return df_renamed\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[52,323],"elapsed":2.243623375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":236356734,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
