Here's a simple function in Julia that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return groupby(df_cars, :model) |> x -> combine(x, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `DataFrames` package in Julia. It groups the data in the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. Then, it applies the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows in that group. The `combine` function is used to apply the `nrow` function to each group and return a new DataFrame with the results.","status":200,"tokens":[52,177],"elapsed":1.257156834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1402153071,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
