The `groupby` function is used to group the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column. This creates a `GroupedDataFrame` object.\n\n2. The `combine` function is then applied to the grouped DataFrame. It applies the specified aggregation function to each group.\n\n3. Inside `combine`, the `nrow` function is used as the aggregation function. It counts the number of rows in each group.\n\n4. The `=> :count` part specifies that the result of the aggregation should be stored in a new column named `count`.\n\n5. The resulting DataFrame will have two columns: `model` (the unique models) and `count` (the number of rows for each model).\n\nThe function returns the resulting DataFrame with the model counts.\n\nNote: Make sure to have the DataFrames package installed and loaded before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[89,274],"elapsed":14.71849625,"cost":0.021884999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23316,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
