We use the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl to group the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. The `combine` function is then used to perform an aggregation on the grouped data. In this case, we use the `nrow` function to count the number of rows for each group.\n3. The `nrow` function is paired with the `=> :count` syntax to specify that the result of `nrow` should be stored in a new column named `count`.\n4. The resulting DataFrame will have two columns: `model` (the unique values from the `model` column) and `count` (the number of rows for each model).\n\nThe function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and returns a new DataFrame with the count of rows for each unique model.","status":200,"tokens":[89,253],"elapsed":11.750548917,"cost":0.020309999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-20960,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
