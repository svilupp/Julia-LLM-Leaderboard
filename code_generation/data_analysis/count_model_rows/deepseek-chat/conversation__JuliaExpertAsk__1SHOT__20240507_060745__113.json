The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a model and its count.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the column `model` exists in the DataFrame. If the column does not exist, an error will be thrown. You may want to add error checking code to handle this situation. Also, the function assumes that the input is a DataFrame.
