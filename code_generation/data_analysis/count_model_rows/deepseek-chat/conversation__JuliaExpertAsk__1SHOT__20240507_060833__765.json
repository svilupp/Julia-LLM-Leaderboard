Then, it uses the `size` method, which returns a Series containing the count of the number of rows for each group. The result Series has the model names as index and the corresponding counts as values.","status":200,"tokens":[93,114],"elapsed":7.925553583,"cost":4.494e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":658248713,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
