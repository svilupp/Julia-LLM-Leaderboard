Here's how you can implement the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = [size(group, 1) for group in grouped]\n    return counts\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\n\nThis code will output the count of rows for each model:\n\n```\n[3, 1, 1, 1]\n```\n\nThis means that there are 3 rows for 'a4', 1 row for 'a6', 1 row for 'q7', and 1 row for 'a4'. Note that 'a4' appears twice in the output because it is counted twice in the input DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[199,270],"elapsed":17.055878542,"cost":0.00010346000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1982993286,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
