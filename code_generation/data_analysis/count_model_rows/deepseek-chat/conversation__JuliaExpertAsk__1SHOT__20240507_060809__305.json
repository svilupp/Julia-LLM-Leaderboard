The result is a new DataFrame with the counts of rows for each model.\n\nPlease remember to import the DataFrames package using `using DataFrames` before calling this function. Also, make sure the column `model` exists in your DataFrame `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[93,194],"elapsed":12.635494875,"cost":6.734e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1707513121,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
