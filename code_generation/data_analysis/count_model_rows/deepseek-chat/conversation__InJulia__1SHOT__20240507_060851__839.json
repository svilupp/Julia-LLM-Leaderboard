Here is how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = Dict(g.model[1] => nrow(g) for g in grouped)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby(df_cars, :model)` groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column. Then, the function creates a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the counts of rows for each model. The `Dict` function is used to create the dictionary, with a comprehension that iterates over each group `g` in the `grouped` object, taking the first model `g.model[1]` (since all rows in a group have the same model) and the number of rows in the group `nrow(g)`.","status":200,"tokens":[54,255],"elapsed":17.694880834,"cost":7.896e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":800166342,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
