It is part of the scientific computing package 'pandas' in Python. Here is how you can write the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    return df_cars.groupby('model').size()\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby('model')` groups the DataFrame by the column 'model'. The `size()` function then returns the number of rows in each group. The result is a Series where the index is the 'model' and the values are the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[93,159],"elapsed":11.325518584,"cost":5.754e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":638478724,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
