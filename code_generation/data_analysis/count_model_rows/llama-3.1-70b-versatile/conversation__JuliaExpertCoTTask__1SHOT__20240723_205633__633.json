This function allows us to group a DataFrame by one or more columns and perform aggregation operations on each group.\n\n**Step 2: Write the function**\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column and count the number of rows in each group\n    model_counts = groupby(df_cars, :model) |> nrow\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\n**Step 3: Solve the task**\n\nNow, let's apply the `count_model_rows` function to the provided DataFrame `df_cars`.\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\n**Step 4: Check the solution**\n\nThe output should be a NamedTuple with the model names as keys and the corresponding row counts as values.\n\nExample output:\n```julia\n(a4 = 3, a6 = 1, q7 = 1)\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 3 rows for model \"a4\", 1 row for model \"a6\", and 1 row for model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[183,296],"elapsed":1.479388,"cost":0.00034181,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1475246743,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
