We define the `count_model_rows` function, which takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we use `groupby` to group the data by the `model` column, and `combine` to apply the `nrow` function to each group, effectively counting the number of rows for each model.\n3. We rename the resulting column to `num_rows` for better readability.\n4. We return the resulting DataFrame `df_count`.\n\nYou can modify this code to fit your specific use case, but this should give you a good starting point.","status":200,"tokens":[58,372],"elapsed":1.699603167,"cost":0.0003281,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":975359344,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
