The `nrow` function then calculates the number of rows for each group, and the result is converted back into a DataFrame for easier inspection. \n\nHere is how to use the function:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"])\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[93,176],"elapsed":0.968102875,"cost":0.00019391,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-734161205,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
