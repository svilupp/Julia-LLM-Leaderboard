Import the necessary package.\n2. Define the function `count_model_rows`.\n3. Use the `groupby` and `count` methods to aggregate the data.\n4. Return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Sample data\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# Function to count rows by model\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `groupby(df, :model)` groups data by the `model` column.\n- The `combine(..., nrow => :count)` counts the number of rows for each group and labels the count as `count`.\n\n### Check the Solution:\nRunning the above code will yield the following output:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count \n─────┼───────────────\n   1 │ a4         3\n   2 │ a6         1\n   3 │ q7         1\n```\n\nThis confirms that the function correctly counts the number of rows for each model in the DataFrame `df_cars`. The solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[181,332],"elapsed":3.316779167,"cost":0.00022635,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2139704259,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
