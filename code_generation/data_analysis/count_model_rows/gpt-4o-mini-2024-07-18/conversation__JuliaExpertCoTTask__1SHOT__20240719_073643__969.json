Return the results as a new DataFrame.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define the function to count model rows\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combined(DataFrame, groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# Call the function and display the result\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nAfter implementing, I will now check if the solution works as expected by running the code.
