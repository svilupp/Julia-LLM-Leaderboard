Here we use `nrow` to count rows, storing the result in a column named `:count`\n- Wrapping it in `DataFrame` converts the output to a DataFrame with a model and count column\n\nSo this will return a new DataFrame with the model as the index, and a `:count` column with the number of rows for each model group.\n\nYou would call it by passing your cars DataFrame `df_cars` like:\n\n```julia \nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nLet me know if any part of this needs more explanation!","status":200,"tokens":[54,239],"elapsed":9.591293833,"cost":0.006168,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32440,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
