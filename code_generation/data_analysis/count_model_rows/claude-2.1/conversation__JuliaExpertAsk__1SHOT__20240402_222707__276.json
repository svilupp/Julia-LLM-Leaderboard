It pipes that grouped data into the `combine` function from the DataFrames package, applying `nrow` to each group to count the rows. This returns a new DataFrame with the model as the index and the count of rows for each model.\n\nAn alternative with chained calls is:\n\n```julia \nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    groupby(df_cars, :model) |> nrow |> DataFrame \nend\n```\n\nThe `nrow` call aggregates by counting rows, then `DataFrame` converts the output to a DataFrame.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[92,221],"elapsed":24.861982167,"cost":0.00604,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24498,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
