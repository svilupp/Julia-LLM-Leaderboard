This function uses the `groupby` and `combine` functions from the DataFrames package to group the data by the `model` column and then count the number of rows in each group.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    df_grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    df_count = combine(df_grouped, nrow)\n    return df_count\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame `df_cars` like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car1\", \"car3\", \"car2\", \"car1\"])\ndf_model_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame `df_model_counts` with two columns: `model` and `nrow`.
