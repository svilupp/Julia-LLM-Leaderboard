The `nrow` function is used to count the number of rows in each group. The resulting DataFrame is then renamed to have the column name `:count` instead of `:x1`. The function returns the grouped and counted DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n5x","status":200,"tokens":[91,200],"elapsed":3.788572834,"cost":0.00046559999999999993,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-2045643692,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
