Then, it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function (which returns the number of rows) to each group. The result is a new DataFrame that shows how many rows there are for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[91,126],"elapsed":4.617331542,"cost":0.0003472,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-237819284,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
