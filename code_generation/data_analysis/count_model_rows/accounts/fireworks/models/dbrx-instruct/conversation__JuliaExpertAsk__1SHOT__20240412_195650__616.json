Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group, which is stored in a new DataFrame `df_result`. The name of this new column is `nrow` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[91,139],"elapsed":3.705418375,"cost":0.00036799999999999995,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1459989735,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
