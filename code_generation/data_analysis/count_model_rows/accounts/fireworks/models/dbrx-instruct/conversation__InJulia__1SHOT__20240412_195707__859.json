Here's how you can define the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model)\n    result_df = combine(grouped_df, :model => length => :count)\n    return result_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column, then it counts the number of rows for each model using `combine` function with the `:model => length` transformation, which gives the length of each group. The result is stored in a new DataFrame with the count named as `:count`.","status":200,"tokens":[56,160],"elapsed":3.029112291,"cost":0.0003456,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1247007773,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
