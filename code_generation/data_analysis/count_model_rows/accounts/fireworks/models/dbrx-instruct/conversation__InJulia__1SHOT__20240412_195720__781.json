Then it calculates the number of rows for each group using `combine` and `nrow` functions and returns the resulting DataFrame `df_counts`.\n\nYou can call this function with your `DataFrame` object like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nAnd the resulting `df_counts` DataFrame will have two columns: `model` and `nrow` where `nrow` indicates the","status":200,"tokens":[56,200],"elapsed":3.469535125,"cost":0.0004096,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1464034125,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
