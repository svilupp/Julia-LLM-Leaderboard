Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    df_cars |> groupby(:model) |> nrow\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `|>` is the pipe operator, which chains operations together in a more readable way. The `groupby` function groups the DataFrame by the `:model` column, and the `nrow` function then counts the number of rows in each group. \n\nYou can also use the `count` function which is a more explicit way to achieve the same result.\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    count(df_cars, :model)\nend\n```\n\nThe `count` function returns a new DataFrame with the counts of each unique value in the specified column.","status":200,"tokens":[57,212],"elapsed":0.84905925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1244114814,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
