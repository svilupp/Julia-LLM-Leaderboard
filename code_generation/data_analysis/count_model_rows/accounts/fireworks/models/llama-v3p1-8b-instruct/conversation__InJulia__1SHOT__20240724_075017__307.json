However, if you want to do this in a single line, you can use the `size` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return size(groupby(df_cars, :model), 1)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return an array of row counts for each model in `df_cars`.\n\nIf you prefer a `map` solution, you could also use:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return map(x -> size(x, 1), groupby(df_cars, :model))\nend\n```\n\nBoth of these functions will return the same result.\n\nYou can call these functions like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"car1\", \"car2\", \"car1\", \"car2\", \"car3\"],\n                    other_col = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts) # Output: [3, 3, 1]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,269],"elapsed":1.012968541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1533186443,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
