This function assumes you are using the DataFrames package.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df_cars, :model) |> \n           nrow |> \n           unstack\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the column `:model`. It then uses the `nrow` function to calculate the number of rows in each group. The `unstack` function is used to convert the result into a standard DataFrame where each model is a row.\n\nPlease note that you need to use the `|>` operator to compose the function calls, and make sure you have the DataFrames package imported.\n\nYou would use the function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(df_counts)\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about how to use this function or need further clarification. \n\nHere's an example with test data in case you want to run this right away:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Test\n\n# Create test DataFrame\nfunction create_df_cars()\n   data = [\n        [\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\"],\n        [\"sedan\", \"sedan\", \"van\", \"suv\", \"bike\"],\n        [2020, 2021, 2020, 2021, 2022]\n    ]\n\n    df_cars = DataFrame(\n        :model => data[1],\n        :type_car => data[2],\n        :Year => data[3]\n    )\n\n    return df_cars\nend\n\ndf_cars = create_df_cars()\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df_cars, :model) |> \n           nrow |> \n           unstack\nend\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,403],"elapsed":12.052154208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-166954400,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
