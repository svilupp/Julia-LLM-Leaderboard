The result is a new DataFrame with one row for each model, with the model name in the `model` column and the number of rows for that model in the `count` column.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"], year=[2010, 2015, 2012, 2018, 2015, 2010])\n\n# Call the function\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(df_counts)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```markdown\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  count\n     │ String Int64\n─────┼─────────────\n   1 │ A         3\n   2 │ B         2\n   3 │ C         1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,300],"elapsed":17.110319917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1171328596,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
