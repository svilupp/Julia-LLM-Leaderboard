This returns a grouped DataFrame object, which can be iterated over to access each group of rows with the same model.\nFor each group, the function creates a new row in a new DataFrame `model_counts` which contains the string representation of the model name and the number of rows","status":200,"tokens":[56,200],"elapsed":3.834804167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-939452733,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
