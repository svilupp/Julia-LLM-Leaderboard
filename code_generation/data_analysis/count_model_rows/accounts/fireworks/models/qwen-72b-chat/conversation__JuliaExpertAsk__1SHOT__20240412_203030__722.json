We can use the `.[!]` syntax to select and transform the columns. The `:model => length` syntax specifies that we want to transform the `:model` column using the `length` function, which counts the number of rows in each group.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|><|im_start|>\n<|im_start|><|im_start|>\n<|im_start|><|endoftext|>","status":200,"tokens":[91,120],"elapsed":2.373647875,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1093398051,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
