We use the `groupby` function to group the DataFrame by the `model` column.\n2. We use the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group. We assign the result to a new column called `count`.\n3. The resulting DataFrame has two columns: `model` and `count`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\", \"Honda\", \"Honda\"])\n\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n3x2 DataFrame\n Row │ model     count\n     │ String    Int64\n─────┼─────────────────\n   1 │ Ford         2\n   2 │ Honda        3\n   3 │ Toyota       2\n```\nNote that the `count_model_rows` function returns a new DataFrame with the model counts. If you want to modify the original DataFrame instead, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[57,309],"elapsed":3.954245041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2039170042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
