It then calculates the number of rows in each group and stores these counts in a new array called `model_counts`. Finally, it creates a new DataFrame `result` with the model names and their corresponding counts.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example DataFrame `df_cars`, the output will be:\n```markdown\n| model    | count |\n|----------|-------|\n| Toyota   |     3 |\n| Honda    |     2 |\n| Ford     |     1 |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,295],"elapsed":4.31264175,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-27275279,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
