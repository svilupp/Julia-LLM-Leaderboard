We use the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column.\n2. We use the `size` function to count the number of rows in each group.\n3. We create a new `DataFrame` called `model_counts` that contains the grouped data and the count of rows for each group.\n4. We return the `model_counts` DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"],\n                   other_column = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\nThis would output:\n```\n   model  count\n1  Ford      2\n2  Honda     1\n3  Toyota    3\n```\nI hope this helps!
