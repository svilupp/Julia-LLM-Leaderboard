Then we use the `count` function to count the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `variable` (which is the model name) and `count` (which is the number of rows for each model).\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"],\n                   year=[2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020],\n                   price=[20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000, 45000])\n\n# Call the function\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ variable | count\n     │ String   | Int64\n─────┼─────────┼──────\n   1 │ Ford     |     2\n   2 │ Honda    |     1\n   3 │ Toyota   |     3\n```\n\nThis shows that there are 2 rows for Ford, 1 row for Honda, and 3 rows for Toyota.","status":200,"tokens":[58,367],"elapsed":2.691837625,"cost":7.186e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":2131376552,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
