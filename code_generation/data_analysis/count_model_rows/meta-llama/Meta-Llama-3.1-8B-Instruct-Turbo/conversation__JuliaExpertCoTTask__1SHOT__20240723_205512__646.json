We import the `DataFrames` package.\n2. We define a function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame as input.\n3. Inside the function, we use the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column.\n4. We then use the `count` function to count the number of rows for each group.\n5. We create an example DataFrame `df_cars` and call the `count_model_rows` function on it.\n6. We print the result.","status":200,"tokens":[183,215],"elapsed":1.623201041,"cost":5.6999999999999996e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":905718836,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
