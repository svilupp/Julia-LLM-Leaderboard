Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a julia function that should achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, maximum = nothing, minimum = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        maximum = maximum(temps)\n        minimum = minimum(temps)\n        trend = isnothing(length(temps) < 2) ? :stable :\n            if issorted(temps) : :increasing\n            elseif issorted(temps, rev = true) : :decreasing\n            else :stable \n            end\n        return (average = average, maximum = maximum, minimum = minimum, trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test it like this:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return:\n\n```\n(average = 23.8, maximum = 27, minimum = 20, trend = :stable)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, and if it is, it returns a named tuple with all 'nothing' fields.
