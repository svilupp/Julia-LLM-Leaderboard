Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function using the `Statistics` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Number,1})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, minimum=nothing, maximum=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n\n        if length(temps) > 1\n            change = temps[end] - temps[1]\n            if change > 0\n                trend_temp = :increasing\n            elseif change < 0\n                trend_temp = :decreasing\n            else\n                trend_temp = :stable\n            end\n        else\n            trend_temp = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg_temp, minimum=min_temp, maximum=max_temp, trend=trend_temp)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If it isn't, we calculate the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures using the `mean`, `minimum`, and `maximum` functions from the `Statistics` package. We also check the trend of the temperatures by comparing the change of temperature between the first day and the last day. If the change is greater than 0, the trend is `:increasing`; if the change is smaller than 0, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[204,398],"elapsed":24.534991708,"cost":0.00014000000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":740957207,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
