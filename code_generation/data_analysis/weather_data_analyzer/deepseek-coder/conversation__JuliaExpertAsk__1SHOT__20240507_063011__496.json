Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a potential solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    max::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    min::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    trend::Union{Nothing, Symbol}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = nothing\n    if max_temp == temps[1]\n        if min_temp == temps[end]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif min_temp == temps[1]\n            trend = :stable\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    elseif min_temp == temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return WeatherData(avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nFirst, this function checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it constructs and returns a `WeatherData` named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature using the `Statistics` package. \n\nThe trend is then calculated by comparing the first and last elements of the `temps` list (as a guess of the general trend). Then, if the maximum temperature is equal to the first element of `temps`, it checks if the minimum temperature is also equal to the last element. If they are, the trend is set to `:increasing`, if they are not, but are equal to the first element, the trend is `:stable`, otherwise, it is set to `:decreasing`. If the first element is not equal to the maximum, but it is equal to the minimum, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, a `WeatherData` named tuple is returned with the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the calculated trend.","status":200,"tokens":[204,535],"elapsed":36.231417541,"cost":0.00017836000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1756437300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
