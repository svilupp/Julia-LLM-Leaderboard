Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that performs the required statistical analyses on the given temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = temps[end] > temps[1] ? :increasing : temps[end] < temps[1] ? :decreasing : :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then checks if the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable based on the first and last elements of the list. The trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is considered to be increasing. If the last element is less than the first, the trend is considered to be decreasing. If neither of these conditions is met, the trend is considered to be stable. Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[163,389],"elapsed":14.23882875,"cost":0.00013174,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":40442265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
