X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   * Using the Statistics package for statistical analysis\n   * Defining a function\n   * Creating a named tuple\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Perform statistical analysis\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    diff = last(temps) - first(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(diff > 0, :increasing,\n                   ifelse(diff < 0, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it performs the statistical analysis using the `Statistics` package and determines the trend based on the difference between the first and last temperatures in the list. The function then returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` results.","status":200,"tokens":[463,382],"elapsed":7.978951792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
