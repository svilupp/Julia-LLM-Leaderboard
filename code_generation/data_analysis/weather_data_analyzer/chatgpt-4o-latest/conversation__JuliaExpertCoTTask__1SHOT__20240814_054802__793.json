Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Approach\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty:** If `temps` is an empty list, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculate the average temperature:** Use the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. **Find the maximum and minimum temperatures:** Use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively.\n4. **Determine the trend:**\n   - If the list is strictly increasing, set `trend` to `:increasing`.\n   - If the list is strictly decreasing, set `trend` to `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, set `trend` to `:stable`.\n5. **Return the results:** Return a named tuple containing `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if all(x > y for (x, y) in zip(temps[2:end], temps[1:end-1]))\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x < y for (x, y) in zip(temps[2:end], temps[1:end-1]))\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Empty Check:** The function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, a named tuple containing `nothing` for all fields is returned.\n- **Statistics Calculation:** When the list is not empty, the statistics are computed:\n  - `average` is calculated using `mean(temps)`.\n  - `max` is found using `maximum(temps)`.\n  - `min` is found using `minimum(temps)`.\n- **Trend Detection:**\n  - The sequence is checked if it is steadily increasing or decreasing based on the pairwise comparison of consecutive elements.\n  - If neither is true, the trend is set as `:stable`.\n- **Named Tuple:** Finally, a named tuple with relevant data is returned.\n\n### Output\n\nFor the example input `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, the function returns:\n\n```julia\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :stable)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[254,584],"elapsed":6.084521208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":970251106,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
