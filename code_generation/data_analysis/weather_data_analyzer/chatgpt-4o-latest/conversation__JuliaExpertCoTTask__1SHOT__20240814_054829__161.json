Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Evaluate the Edge Case**: First, check if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. **Perform Basic Statistical Analysis**:\n    - Calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n    - Find the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function.\n    - Find the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n\n3. **Determine the Trend**:\n   - Traverse through the list to determine if the temperatures are generally increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n   - If all consecutive differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If all consecutive differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n4. **Return the Results**:\n    - Return the results in a named tuple containing `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = compute_trend(temps)\n\n    return (; average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nfunction compute_trend(temps)\n    is_increasing = true\n    is_decreasing = true\n\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n            is_decreasing = false\n        elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n            is_increasing = false\n        else\n            is_increasing = false\n            is_decreasing = false\n        end\n        if !(is_increasing || is_decreasing)\n            return :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    if is_increasing\n        return :increasing\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        return :decreasing\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Example Run:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\n### Expected Result:\n\n```julia\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :stable)\n```\n\nThis solution checks for an empty list, performs statistical calculations, determines the trend, and returns the results in a named tuple. The function `compute_trend` ensures that the correct trend is identified based on consecutive temperature changes.","status":200,"tokens":[254,553],"elapsed":5.878350625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-831569526,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
