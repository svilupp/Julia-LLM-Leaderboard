Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Approach:\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**: If the `temps` list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculate Statistics**: If the list is not empty, calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package.\n3. **Determine Trend**: \n   - **Increasing**: If each subsequent element is larger than the previous, set trend to `:increasing`.\n   - **Decreasing**: If each subsequent element is smaller than the previous, set trend to `:decreasing`.\n   - **Stable**: If temperatures neither consistently increase nor decrease, set trend to `:stable`.\n4. **Return Results**: Return a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Return early if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate required statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(temps[i] >= temps[i-1] for i in 2:length(temps))\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] <= temps[i-1] for i in 2:length(temps))\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the result in a named tuple\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Test with Provided Data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Output:\n\nThis will display the results in the form of a named tuple, containing statistical values and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[254,410],"elapsed":5.607875834,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":11165568,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
