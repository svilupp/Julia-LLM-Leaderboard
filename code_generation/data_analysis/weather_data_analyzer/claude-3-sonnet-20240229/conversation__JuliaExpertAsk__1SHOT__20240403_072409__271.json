If the `temps` list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. It calculates the `average` temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. It finds the `max` and `min` temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively.\n4. It calculates the differences between consecutive temperatures using the `temps_diff = temps[2:end] .- temps[1:end-1]` expression.\n5. It counts the number of increasing and decreasing differences using `increasing_count = sum(temps_diff .> 0)` and `decreasing_count = sum(temps_diff .< 0)`, respectively.\n6. It determines the `trend` based on the values of `increasing_count` and `decreasing_count`. If `increasing_count` is greater than `decreasing_count`, the trend is `:increasing`. If `increasing_count` is less than `decreasing_count`, the trend is `:decreasing`. If they are equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n7. It returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the temperature data is sorted chronologically. If the data is not sorted, the `trend` calculation may not be accurate.","status":200,"tokens":[181,530],"elapsed":8.784540417,"cost":0.008493,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-27975,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
