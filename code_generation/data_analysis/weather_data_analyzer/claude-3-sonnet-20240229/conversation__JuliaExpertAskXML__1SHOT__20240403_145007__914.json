It first checks if the input vector is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the input vector is not empty, it sorts the temperatures in ascending order using `sort` function. It then calculates the `average` temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package. The `max` and `min` temperatures are obtained by taking the last and first elements of the sorted vector, respectively.\n\nThe `trend` is determined by calculating the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted vector. If the difference is positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If the difference is negative, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the difference is zero, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[186,391],"elapsed":7.623815792,"cost":0.006423000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":16410,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
