Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = if first(temps) < last(temps)\n            :increasing\n        elseif first(temps) > last(temps)\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n        return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of temperatures `temps` as input. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It also determines the trend by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list.\n\n- If the first temperature is less than the last, the trend is set to `:increasing`.\n- If the first temperature is greater than the last, the trend is set to `:decreasing`.\n- If the first and last temperatures are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nThe function then returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[263,405],"elapsed":7.426922708,"cost":0.006864,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4132,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
