[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    increasing_trend = sum(diffs .> 0) > sum(diffs .< 0)\n    decreasing_trend = sum(diffs .< 0) > sum(diffs .> 0)\n    \n    trend = if increasing_trend\n        :increasing\n    elseif decreasing_trend\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of numbers `temps` representing daily temperatures. It first checks if the vector is empty, in which case it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the vector is not empty, it calculates the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend, it computes the differences between consecutive temperatures using `diff(temps)`. It then counts the number of positive differences (`sum(diffs .> 0)`) and negative differences (`sum(diffs .< 0)`). If the number of positive differences is greater, it sets the `trend` to `:increasing`. If the number of negative differences is greater, it sets the `trend` to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it sets the `trend` to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nNote: I have not included any special instructions as you did not provide any.","status":200,"tokens":[432,447],"elapsed":8.171346333,"cost":0.008001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
