Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = temps[end] - temps[1]\n    trend = diff > 0 ? :increasing : diff < 0 ? :decreasing : :stable\n\n    return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We first check if the `temps` list is empty using `isempty(temps)`. If so, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. If the list is not empty, we calculate the `average` temperature using `mean(temps)` from the `Statistics` package.\n\n3. We find the `max` and `min` temperatures using `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)` respectively.\n\n4. To determine the `trend`, we calculate the difference between the last and first temperature values (`temps[end] - temps[1]`). If the difference is positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If the difference is negative, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the difference is zero, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n5. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the temperatures are ordered chronologically in the `temps` list.","status":200,"tokens":[186,367],"elapsed":7.213438708,"cost":0.006063000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":86,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
