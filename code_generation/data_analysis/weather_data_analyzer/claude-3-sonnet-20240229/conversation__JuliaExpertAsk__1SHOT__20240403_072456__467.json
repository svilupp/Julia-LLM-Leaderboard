Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    if sorted_temps[end] > sorted_temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif sorted_temps[end] < sorted_temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the `average` temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package, the `max` and `min` temperatures using `maximum` and `minimum`, respectively.\n\nTo determine the `trend`, it sorts the `temps` list in ascending order using `sort`. If the last element is greater than the first, it means the temperatures are increasing, and `trend` is set to `:increasing`. If the last element is less than the first, it means the temperatures are decreasing, and `trend` is set to `:decreasing`. If they are equal, it means the temperatures are stable, and `trend` is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[181,368],"elapsed":6.793038791,"cost":0.006063,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29854,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
