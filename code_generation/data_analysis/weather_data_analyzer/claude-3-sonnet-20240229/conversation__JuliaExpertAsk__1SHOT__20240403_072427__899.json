Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    first_half = temps[1:end÷2]\n    second_half = temps[end÷2+1:end]\n    first_half_avg = mean(first_half)\n    second_half_avg = mean(second_half)\n\n    trend = if second_half_avg > first_half_avg\n        :increasing\n    elseif second_half_avg < first_half_avg\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of temperatures `temps` as input. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nFor a non-empty list, it calculates the following statistics:\n\n- `average` temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package.\n- `max` temperature using `maximum`.\n- `min` temperature using `minimum`.\n- `trend` is determined by comparing the average of the first half of the data with the average of the second half. If the second half average is greater, the trend is `:increasing`. If it's less, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the averages are equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nNote: The function assumes that the input `temps` is a valid list of numbers. If the input data is not numeric or contains invalid values, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.","status":200,"tokens":[181,446],"elapsed":8.357803708,"cost":0.007233,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":6773,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
