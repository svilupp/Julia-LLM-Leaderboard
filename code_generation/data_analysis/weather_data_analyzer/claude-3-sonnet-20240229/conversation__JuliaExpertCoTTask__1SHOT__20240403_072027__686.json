Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on a list of daily temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. If the list is not empty, it calculates the `mean_temp` using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. It finds the `max_temp` and `min_temp` using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively.\n4. It determines the `trend` by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last element is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n5. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n# Output: (average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n\nweather_data_analyzer([])\n# Output: (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\n\nNote: The `Statistics` package is used for calculating the mean, maximum, and minimum values. It needs to be imported at the beginning of the code using `using Statistics`.","status":200,"tokens":[263,498],"elapsed":9.065739667,"cost":0.008259,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7363,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
