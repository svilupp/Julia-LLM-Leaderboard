We first import the `Statistics` package for functions like `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`.\n2. The `weather_data_analyzer` function takes a list of temperatures `temps` as input.\n3. If `temps` is empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. Otherwise, we calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively.\n5. To determine the trend, we first calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures using `diff(temps)`.\n6. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`.\n7. If all differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n8. If neither of the above conditions hold, the trend is `:stable`.\n9. Finally, we return a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input list `temps` only contains numbers. If it contains non-numeric values, the function will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[186,388],"elapsed":6.648900416,"cost":0.006378000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8325,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
