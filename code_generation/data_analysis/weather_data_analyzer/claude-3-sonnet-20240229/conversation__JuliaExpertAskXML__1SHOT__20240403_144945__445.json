It then counts the number of positive and negative differences. If there are more positive differences, it means the trend is increasing. If there are more negative differences, the trend is decreasing. If there are equal positive and negative differences, the trend is stable.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[186,383],"elapsed":5.981281125,"cost":0.0063030000000000004,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26150,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
