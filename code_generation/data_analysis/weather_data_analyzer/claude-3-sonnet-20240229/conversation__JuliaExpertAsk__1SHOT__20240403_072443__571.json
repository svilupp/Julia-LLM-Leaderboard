Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if all(diff(temps) .>= 0) \n        :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .<= 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (;average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector of real numbers `temps` as input and performs the following operations:\n\n1. If the input vector `temps` is empty, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n2. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the `average` temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package.\n3. It finds the `max` and `min` temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions.\n4. It determines the `trend` of the temperature data using the `diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive temperature values:\n    - If all differences are non-negative (i.e., temperatures are increasing or stable), the trend is `:increasing`.\n    - If all differences are non-positive (i.e., temperatures are decreasing or stable), the trend is `:decreasing`.\n    - If neither of the above conditions is met, the trend is `:stable`.\n5. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nNote that the function uses the `<:Real` type constraint to allow the input vector to contain any real number type (e.g., `Float64`, `Int64`, etc.).","status":200,"tokens":[181,439],"elapsed":7.740257916,"cost":0.007128000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23241,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
