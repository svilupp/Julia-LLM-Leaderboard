Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n</question>","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    diff = temps[end] - temps[1]\n    trend = diff > 0 ? :increasing : diff < 0 ? :decreasing : :stable\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nTo explain:\n\n1. We first check if the input list `temps` is empty using `isempty(temps)`. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. If the list is not empty, we calculate the `average` using `mean(temps)`, `max` using `maximum(temps)`, and `min` using `minimum(temps)`.\n\n3. To determine the `trend`, we calculate the difference between the last and first elements of the list: `diff = temps[end] - temps[1]`. If `diff` is positive, it means the temperatures are increasing, so we set `trend = :increasing`. If `diff` is negative, it means the temperatures are decreasing, so we set `trend = :decreasing`. If `diff` is zero, it means the temperatures are stable, so we set `trend = :stable`.\n\n4. Finally, we return a named tuple with the calculated values using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)` syntax.\n\nNote that we're using the `Statistics` package from the Julia standard library to calculate the statistical measures like `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`.","status":200,"tokens":[186,416],"elapsed":7.554379083,"cost":0.006798,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4402,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
