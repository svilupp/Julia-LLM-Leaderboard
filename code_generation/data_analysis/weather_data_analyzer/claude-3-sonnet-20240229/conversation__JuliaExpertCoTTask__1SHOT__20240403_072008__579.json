Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = last(sorted_temps)\n    min_temp = first(sorted_temps)\n    \n    trend = if max_temp > min_temp\n        :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < min_temp\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (;average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\n```\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Check if the input `temps` list is empty. If so, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. Sort the `temps` list in ascending order.\n3. Calculate the `average` temperature using `mean`.\n4. Get the `max_temp` by taking the last element of the sorted list.\n5. Get the `min_temp` by taking the first element of the sorted list.\n6. Determine the `trend` by comparing the `max_temp` and `min_temp`.\n   - If `max_temp` is greater than `min_temp`, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If `max_temp` is less than `min_temp`, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - If `max_temp` is equal to `min_temp`, the trend is `:stable`.\n7. Return a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nThe example usage shows the output when calling `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`.","status":200,"tokens":[263,470],"elapsed":8.809143792,"cost":0.007839,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21819,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
