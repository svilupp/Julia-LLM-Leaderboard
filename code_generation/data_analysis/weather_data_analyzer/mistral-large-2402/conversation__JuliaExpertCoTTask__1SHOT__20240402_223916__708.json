Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how I would approach this problem in Julia:\n\nFirst, I would import the necessary package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nThen, I would define the function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = (temps[end] > temps[1]) ? :increasing :\n             (temps[end] < temps[1]) ? :decreasing :\n             :stable\n\n    return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input vector `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. It then determines the trend by comparing the first and last elements of `temps`. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`; if it's less, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nYou can then call this function with your data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with the statistical analyses of the temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[290,443],"elapsed":10.443532417,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1960570259,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
