Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write the Julia function `weather_data_analyzer` according to your specifications. Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input vector `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. The trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements of `temps`. The function then returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[290,315],"elapsed":8.315535708,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":888352940,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
