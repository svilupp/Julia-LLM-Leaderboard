X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**\n   - We'll need to use the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean (average).\n   - We'll use Julia's built-in functions `maximum` and `minimum` to find the maximum and minimum temperatures.\n   - We'll use a named tuple to return the results, using the syntax `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`.\n   - We'll use control structures like `if-elseif-else` to determine the trend.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**\n   - First, we'll import the `Statistics` package.\n   - Then, we'll define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures `temps`.\n   - Inside the function, we'll calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n   - We'll then determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list.\n   - Finally, we'll return a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n   - We'll test the function with some sample data to ensure it's working as expected.\n\nHere's the Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work as per your requirements. Please test it with your actual data to ensure it meets your needs.","status":200,"tokens":[460,521],"elapsed":12.4889895,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-340511276,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
