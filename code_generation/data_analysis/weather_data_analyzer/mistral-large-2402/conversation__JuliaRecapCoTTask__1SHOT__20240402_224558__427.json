Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**\n   - We'll need to use the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean (average), maximum, and minimum values.\n   - We'll use a named tuple to return the results.\n   - We'll use control structures like `if-elseif-else` for determining the trend.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**\n   - First, we'll import the `Statistics` package.\n   - Then, we'll define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures `temps`.\n   - Inside the function, we'll calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively.\n   - We'll determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If it's less, the trend is `:decreasing`. If they're equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n   - We'll return the results in a named tuple.\n   - If the list is empty, we'll return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n   - We'll test the function with some sample data to make sure it's working correctly.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input is a non-empty list of numbers. If the list can contain other types of values or be empty, you might need to add some additional error checking. Also, this code uses the first and last elements of the list to determine the trend, which might not be accurate if the temperatures fluctuate a lot. If you need a more sophisticated analysis of the trend, you might need to use a different approach.\n\nAs there are no special instructions provided, I followed the general guidelines for Julia programming.
