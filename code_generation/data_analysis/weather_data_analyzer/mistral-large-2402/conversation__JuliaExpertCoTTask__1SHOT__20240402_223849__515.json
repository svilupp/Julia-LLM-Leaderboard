Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow the problem-solving steps you've outlined to solve this task. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Import the necessary package (Statistics)\n   - Define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as an argument\n   - Check if the list is empty, if so, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`\n   - If the list is not empty, calculate the average, max, and min temperatures\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list\n   - Return a named tuple with the calculated values\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        mx = maximum(temps)\n        mn = minimum(temps)\n        tr = temps[end] > temps[1] ? :increasing : (temps[end] < temps[1] ? :decreasing : :stable)\n        return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=tr)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `weather_data_analyzer` has been defined to solve the task.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - Let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend in the temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[290,449],"elapsed":11.274860375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-701939365,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
