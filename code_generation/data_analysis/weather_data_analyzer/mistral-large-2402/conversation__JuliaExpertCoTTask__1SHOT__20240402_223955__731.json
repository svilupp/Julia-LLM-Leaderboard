Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's how I would approach this problem in Julia:\n\nFirst, I would import the necessary package. Then, I would define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as an argument. Inside the function, I would calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the functions provided by the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, I would compare the first and last elements of the list. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last element is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. If they are equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nIf the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend of the temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[290,424],"elapsed":10.203735667,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1132021486,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
