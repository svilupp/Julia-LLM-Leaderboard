Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a concise Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    isempty(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n    tr = (temps[end] > temps[1]) ? :increasing : (temps[end] < temps[1]) ? :decreasing : :stable\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=tr)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input vector `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend based on the first and last elements of `temps`. The results are then returned as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[194,255],"elapsed":8.204635959,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-852106414,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
