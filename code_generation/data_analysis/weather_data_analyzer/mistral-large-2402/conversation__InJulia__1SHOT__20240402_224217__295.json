Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function in Julia that should meet your requirements. Please ensure that you have the `Statistics` package installed.

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. The trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements of `temps`. If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last element is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. If they are equal, the trend is `:stable`. The results are then returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[153,373],"elapsed":11.143500375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1206141338,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
