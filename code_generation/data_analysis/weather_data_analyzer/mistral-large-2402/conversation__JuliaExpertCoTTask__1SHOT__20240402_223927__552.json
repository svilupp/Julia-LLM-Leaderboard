Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you write the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n   - Import the necessary package (Statistics)\n   - Define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as an argument\n   - Check if the list is empty, if so, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`\n   - Calculate the average, max, and min temperatures using the functions provided by the Statistics package\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list\n   - Return a named tuple with the calculated values\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    isempty(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = (temps[end] > temps[1]) ? :increasing :\n             (temps[end] < temps[1]) ? :decreasing :\n             :stable\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   - The function `weather_data_analyzer` is defined and ready to use.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n   - You can test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return a named tuple with the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[290,448],"elapsed":10.3672965,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1571163137,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
