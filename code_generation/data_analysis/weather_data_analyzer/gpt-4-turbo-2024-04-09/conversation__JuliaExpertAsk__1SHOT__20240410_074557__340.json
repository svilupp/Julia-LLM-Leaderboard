Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's the function `weather_data_analyzer` defined in Julia, which uses the `Statistics` package. This function will compute the average, max, and min temperatures from the provided data, and also determine the trend of the temperature series.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average, minimum, and maximum\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .>= 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .<= 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input temperatures list `temps` is empty. If it is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the following:\n\n1. `avg_temp`: The average of the temperature list using `mean()`.\n2. `max_temp`: The maximum temperature using `maximum()`.\n3. `min_temp`: The minimum temperature using `minimum()`.\n\nTo determine the `trend`, the function checks:\n- If all consecutive differences (`diff(temps)`) are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`.\n- If all consecutive differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n- Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nThe result is then returned as a named tuple for clean and structured output.","status":200,"tokens":[178,380],"elapsed":11.152959291,"cost":0.01318,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-129121981,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
