Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Solution Outline\n\n1. Check if the input data `temps` is empty.\n2. If empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum of the temperatures.\n4. Determine the trend of the temperatures (`:increasing`, `:decreasing`, `:stable`):\n   - `:increasing` if every value is greater than or equal to the previous one with at least one value higher.\n   - `:decreasing` if every value is less than or equal to the previous one with at least one value lower.\n   - `:stable` if neither of the above conditions apply.\n5. Return the calculated results as a named tuple.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe'll implement the function `weather_data_analyzer` applying the above step-by-step logic, and also utilize Julia's built-in `Statistics` package to facilitate computations such as mean calculation.\n\nLet's move on to the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Step 2: Handle the case where temps is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate average, maximum, minimum \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the trend\n    increasing = true\n    decreasing = true\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] < temps[i - 1]\n            increasing = false\n        elseif temps[i] > temps[i - 1]\n            decreasing = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Set the trend based on boolean flags\n    trend = :stable  # default to stable\n    if increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n  \n    # Step 5: Return results in a named tuple\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nWith the function fully defined, let's check its correctness using an example provided:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThe output should be: `(average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:stable)`, as none of the `increasing` or `decreasing` trends fully hold throughout the series.","status":200,"tokens":[255,525],"elapsed":12.686028917,"cost":0.0183,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":26810749,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
