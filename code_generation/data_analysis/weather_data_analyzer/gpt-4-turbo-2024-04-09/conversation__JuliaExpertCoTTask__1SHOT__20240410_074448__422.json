Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Analyze the Approach**: We need to compute the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the `temps` list. Additionally, we need to determine the trend of temperatures based on day-to-day change.\n\n2. **Write the Function**: In this function:\n   - We use the `Statistics` package for calculating the average.\n   - We handle the case when the input list is empty by returning `nothing` for all fields.\n   - We determine the `trend` by comparing consecutive days. If temperatures consistently increase, it's `:increasing`; if consistently decreasing, it's `:decreasing`; otherwise, it's `:stable`.\n\n3. **Check Solution**: Ensure the function correctly computes and returns the required results.\n\nLet's implement the function `weather_data_analyzer`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    increasing = true\n    decreasing = true\n\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n            decreasing = false\n        elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n            increasing = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Example Execution\nFor the provided example `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`:\n1. **Average**: computed using `mean` function would be `(25+27+23+20+22)/5 = 23.4`.\n2. **Max**: `maximum([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])` is `27`.\n3. **Min**: `minimum([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])` is `20`.\n4. **Trend**: Based on the sequence, it's not strictly increasing or decreasing, hence `:stable`.\n\nOutput will be `(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :stable)`.","status":200,"tokens":[255,522],"elapsed":10.945895334,"cost":0.01821,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1146511544,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
