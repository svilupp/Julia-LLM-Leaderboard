Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, ensure you have access to the `Statistics` package which provides the functions needed for calculating the average, minimum, and maximum.\n\nHere is the function `weather_data_analyzer` based on the requirement:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        # Determine the trend\n        if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (;average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function:\n- Uses the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum values from the `temps` list.\n- Determines the temperature trend:\n  - `:increasing` if all differences between consecutive days are positive.\n  - `:decreasing` if all differences are negative.\n  - `:stable` otherwise (if there's any increase and decrease).\n- Uses a conditional expression to handle cases when the `temps` list is empty, returning nothing for all values.\n- Constructs the output as a named tuple with keys and calculated values.\n\nYou can test this function by passing different lists of temperature values to see if it correctly calculates the statistics and identifies the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[178,346],"elapsed":14.6333055,"cost":0.01216,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1591556651,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
