[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Julia's `Statistics` package can help us with calculations like mean, minimum, and maximum.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. **Check for Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculate `average`, `max`, `min`**: Using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` module to compute these values.\n3. **Determine the Trend**: Examine how the temperature changes:\n   - Increment through the `temps` list and check if it is always increasing, always decreasing, or if neither condition is fully satisfied (which would be deemed stable).\n4. **Construct a Named Tuple for Output**: Create a named tuple with fields `average`, `max`, `min`, `trend`.\n5. **Use Module Import**: Ensure `using Statistics` is noted for required statistical operations.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        if length(temps) > 1\n            increasing = true\n            decreasing = true\n            for i in 2:length(temps)\n                if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n                    decreasing = false\n                elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n                    increasing = false\n                end\n            end\n            if increasing\n                trend = :increasing\n            elseif decreasing\n                trend = :decreasing\n            else\n                trend = :stable\n            end\n        else\n            trend = :stable  # A single value, no movement up or down.\n        end\n\n        return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks the length of the list to decide how to treat the trend (including special handling for a single-element list). It ensures proper handling of empty lists and uses tuple syntax `(average = ..., ...)` for clear and instructive response format.","status":200,"tokens":[403,484],"elapsed":9.91644075,"cost":0.01855,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1056709622,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
