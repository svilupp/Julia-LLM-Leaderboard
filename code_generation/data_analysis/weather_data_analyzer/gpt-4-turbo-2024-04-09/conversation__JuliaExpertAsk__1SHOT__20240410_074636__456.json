Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement the function `weather_data_analyzer` in Julia, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = :stable  # default is stable\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Signature**: The function `weather_data_analyzer` expects a vector of floating-point numbers, `temps`.\n\n2. **Empty Case**: If `temps` is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n3. **Calculating Statistics**:\n   - `avg_temp`: Uses `mean` from the `Statistics` package to get the average temperature.\n   - `max_temp`: Uses `maximum` to find the highest temperature.\n   - `min_temp`: Uses `minimum` to find the lowest temperature.\n\n4. **Determining Trend**:\n   - Initializes the `trend` with `:stable`.\n   - If the differences between consecutive temperatures (found using `diff(temps)`) are all positive, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If all the differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns a named tuple containing the calculated `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and the determined `trend`.\n\nThis setup effectively calculates the necessary statistics and analyzes the temperature trend in a given array. You must ensure you have an array of `Float64` for this function to work correctly due to the specified type in the function signature.","status":200,"tokens":[178,427],"elapsed":11.455632625,"cost":0.01459,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1022229382,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
