[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Solution Approach\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**:\n   - Input: A list of daily temperatures.\n   - Outputs: Named tuple of `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and overall `trend`.\n\n2. **Check Input**:\n   - If the list is empty, return all metrics as `nothing`.\n\n3. **Compute Basic Statistics**:\n   - Determine `average` using the `mean()` function.\n   - Get the `max` temperature using the `maximum()` function.\n   - Get the `min` temperature using the `minimum()` function.\n\n4. **Determine Trend**:\n   - Use the differences between consecutive days to check overall trend.\n   - If all differences are positive, set trend to `:increasing`.\n   - If all differences are negative, set trend to `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, if there is a mix or no significant changes, set the trend to `:stable`.\n\n5. **Return Results**:\n   - Organize the computed results (`average`, `max`, `min`, `trend`) into a named tuple as specified.\n\nBy following this approach, we will ensure broad coverage and correct handling of the requirements for the `weather_data_analyzer` function.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # This would ideally be at the global level not inside function definition\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    av = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mi = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        differences = diff(temps)\n        if all(d > 0 for d in differences)\n            tr = :increasing\n        elseif all(d < 0 for d in differences)\n            tr = :decreasing\n        else\n            tr = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        tr = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=av, max=mx, min=mi, trend=tr)\nend\n\n# Test examples given by the task\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\nNote: The dependency to `Statistics` allows the usage of `mean()`, while ensuring to manage any issues by enclosing it with appropriate error handling (if needed). The exact same code can be directly run in your Julia environment after ensuring the Statistics package is available.","status":200,"tokens":[255,520],"elapsed":15.270707042,"cost":0.01815,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-907215881,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
