You will also need to determine the trend in the temperature data (increasing, decreasing, or stable) based on the day-to-day changes.\n\nHere is how you can construct such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Analyze the trend\n    function determine_trend(data)\n        increases = 0\n        decreases = 0\n        \n        for i in 2:length(data)\n            if data[i] > data[i-1]\n                increases += 1\n            elseif data[i] < data[i-1]\n                decreases += 1\n            end\n        end\n        \n        if increases == length(data) - 1\n            return :increasing\n        elseif decreases == length(data) - 1\n            return :decreasing\n        else\n            return :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    trend = determine_trend(temps)\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Checking for an empty list:** At the start, the function checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n  \n- **Computing Statistical Measures:**\n  - **Average temperature** is calculated using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` module.\n  - **Maximum temperature** is found using the `maximum` function.\n  - **Minimum temperature** is found using the `minimum` function.\n  \n- **Determining the Trend:**\n  - A helper function `determine_trend` is used.\n  - It iterates through the temperature list and counts the number of times the temperature increases or decreases from one day to the next.\n  - If all comparisons (except one, due to pairwise comparison) show increase, the trend is `:increasing`.\n  - If all comparisons show decrease, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n  - Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nThis function should be able to give you a thorough statistical analysis of daily temperature data provided in the `temps` list.","status":200,"tokens":[143,534],"elapsed":13.357971292,"cost":0.01745,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":548595412,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
