Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task:\n1. **Handling the Empty List**: If the input list `temps` is empty, return the fixed values with `nothing`.\n  \n2. **Average Calculation**: If the list is not empty, calculate the average using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n\n3. **Minimum and Maximum Temperature**: Calculate the minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) temperatures from the list.\n\n4. **Trend Determination**:\n   - If all subsequent values are greater than the previous ones, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If all subsequent values are less than the previous ones, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n5. **Result Consolidation**: Combine results into a named tuple `(; average=..., max=..., min=..., trend=...)`.\n\nNow, let's implement the function and test cases.\n\n```julia\nimport Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = Statistics.mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    increasing = true\n    decreasing = true\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] <= temps[i-1]\n            increasing = false\n        end\n        if temps[i] >= temps[i-1]\n            decreasing = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    if increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example to test\nexample_data = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(example_data)\nprintln(result)  # Note this would output an actual result during run-time\n```\n\nThis function correctly calculates required statistics and determines the trend from a list of temperature readings, handled via a clear systematic step-by-step approach.
