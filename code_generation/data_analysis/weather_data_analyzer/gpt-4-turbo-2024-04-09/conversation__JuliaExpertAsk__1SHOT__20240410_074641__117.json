Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis Julia function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate basic statistics of a given vector of temperatures and infers the temperature trend. A named tuple is used for a clear and informative return structure. It handles cases with empty input and computes an appropriate trend based on the incremental difference of temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[178,210],"elapsed":5.481850209,"cost":0.00808,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1739012490,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
