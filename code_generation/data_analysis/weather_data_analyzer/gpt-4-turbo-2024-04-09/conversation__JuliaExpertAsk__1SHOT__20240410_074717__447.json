Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To develop the `weather_data_analyzer` function that provides statistical analysis on daily temperature data in Julia, first ensure to include the `Statistics` package which provides necessary statistical functions. Following that, the implementation checks if the list is empty to return a tuple with `nothing` values. Then, compute the average, maximum, and minimum values. For the trend, inspect sequential daily changes to determine if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable. Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    if all(temps[i] < temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] > temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nHere, the function:\n- Receives an array of temperatures.\n- Checks for an empty input and returns a preset tuple.\n- Calculates mean, maximum, and minimum.\n- Determines the trend based on pairwise comparisons of the temperatures.\n- Returns the results encapsulated in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[178,324],"elapsed":7.821702083,"cost":0.0115,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":107064839,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
