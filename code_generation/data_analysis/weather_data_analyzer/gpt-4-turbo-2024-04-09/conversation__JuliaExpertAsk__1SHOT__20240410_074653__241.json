Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To compute the required statistics and analyze the trend of the temperature data, we can use Julia's `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum values. To determine the trend, a simple comparison of the first and last elements of the temperatures list can be employed. Here's the Julia function following the specifications:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function starts by checking if the list `temps` is empty and returns all values as `nothing` if true. It calculates the average, max, and min temperatures using the respective functions from the `Statistics` package. The function also determines the trend by comparing the first and last temperature readings. The results are then returned in a named tuple as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[178,275],"elapsed":6.294965667,"cost":0.01003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1135946079,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
