Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `weather_data_analyzer` written in Julia that performs the operations described:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nMake sure to handle the input type properly (e.g., `Float64`). This function computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the inbuilt functions from the `Statistics` package. It assesses the temperature trend based on differences between consecutive days. If all differences are positive, the trend is increasing; if all are negative, the trend is decreasing. If neither condition is fulfilled, the trend remains stable.","status":200,"tokens":[178,245],"elapsed":5.239458708,"cost":0.00913,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-920974724,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
