Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll utilize Julia's built-in capabilities along with the `Statistics` package. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Check for an Empty Set**: If `temps` is empty, return a tuple with `nothing` values.\n2. **Calculate Statistics**:\n   - Calculate average using `mean()`.\n   - Find the maximum using `maximum()`.\n   - Find the minimum using `minimum()`.\n3. **Determine Trend**:\n   - Compare the first and last element to determine trend:\n     - If temperatures are strictly increasing or decreasing throughout the list, adjust the trend accordingly.\n     - Check for any deviation to determine if the trend is stable.\n4. **Compile Results**: Return the values in a named tuple.\n\nNow, I will implement the function `weather_data_analyzer`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Handle empty array case\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Compute statistics\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    temp_max = maximum(temps)\n    temp_min = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Construct the results tuple\n    return (; average=avg, max=temp_max, min=temp_min, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nIn simple terms:\n- The function starts by handling the case where the input list is empty, returning a specific tuple with `nothing` values.\n- Calculate the various statistical metrics if the list is not empty.\n- Determine the trend based on the sequence of differences between consecutive days.\n- Return the results in a formatted named tuple as per specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[255,425],"elapsed":23.328111666,"cost":0.015300000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1235633629,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
