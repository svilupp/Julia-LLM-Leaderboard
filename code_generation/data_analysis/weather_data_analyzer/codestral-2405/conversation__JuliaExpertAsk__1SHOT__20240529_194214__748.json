Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements of the list. If the first element is less than the last element, the trend is `:increasing`. If the first element is greater than the last element, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the first and last elements are equal, the trend is `:stable`. The function then returns a named tuple containing these values.","status":200,"tokens":[194,301],"elapsed":2.122199125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1772387158,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
