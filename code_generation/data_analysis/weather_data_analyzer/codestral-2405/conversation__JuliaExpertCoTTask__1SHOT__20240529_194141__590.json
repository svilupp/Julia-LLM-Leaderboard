Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    isempty(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = temps == sort(temps) ? :increasing : temps == sort(temps, rev=true) ? :decreasing : :stable\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and if so, returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.

It determines the trend by comparing the list with its sorted and reverse-sorted versions. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple containing the results.","status":200,"tokens":[290,275],"elapsed":1.979088458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-9044803,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
