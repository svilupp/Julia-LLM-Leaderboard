Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's follow the problem-solving steps as outlined.\n\n### Step 1: Think through the approach\n\n1. Import the necessary `Statistics` module for calculations.\n2. Create a function named `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures.\n3. Check if the list is empty; if so, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n5. Determine the trend based on the temperature changes:\n   - If temperatures are strictly increasing, set the trend to `:increasing`.\n   - If decreasing, set the trend to `:decreasing`.\n   - If the same, set trend to `:stable`.\n6. Return a named tuple with the results.\n\n### Step 2: Write the function and other code needed\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow, let's run the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nresults = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n\nNow let's formulate the answer correctly:\n\n1. Average: (25 + 27 + 23 + 20 + 22) / 5 = 23.4\n2. Max: 27\n3. Min: 20\n4. Trend: The sequence is decreasing then increasing, so it will be `:stable`.\n\nReturning the final output:\n\n```julia\nprintln(results)\n```\n\nThis will yield:\n```julia\n(average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:stable)\n```\n\n### Final Code\n\nThis code encompasses the complete implementation based on the outlined thought process. You can test this function with different temperature datasets as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[254,517],"elapsed":5.297159792,"cost":0.0003483,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":442475311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
