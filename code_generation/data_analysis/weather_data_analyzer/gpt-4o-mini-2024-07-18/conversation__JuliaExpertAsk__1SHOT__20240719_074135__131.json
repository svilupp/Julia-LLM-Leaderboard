Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a concise implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first checks if the `temps` vector is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- If not empty, it computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n- The trend is determined by checking the differences between consecutive temperatures: \n  - `:increasing` if all differences are positive,\n  - `:decreasing` if all differences are negative,\n  - `:stable` otherwise.\n- Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[175,299],"elapsed":3.47706,"cost":0.00020564999999999998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1023137509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
