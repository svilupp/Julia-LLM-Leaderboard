Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, I'll follow the steps outlined and implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculate the statistics**: Compute the average, maximum, and minimum temperature using the `Statistics` package.\n3. **Determine the trend**: Check if the temperatures are consistently increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n4. **Return the result in a named tuple**. \n\nNow, let's implement the function.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with provided data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- I used the `Statistics` package to handle calculations for mean, max, and min.\n- I applied the `diff` function to check the differences between consecutive temperatures to determine the trend. \n- The named tuple is created using the syntax `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`.\n\n### Validation of the Solution:\nNow that the function is implemented, I will test it with the provided data and some additional edge cases.\n\n```julia\n# Provided Test Case\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))  # Should return calculated values\n\n# Additional Test Cases\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([]))  # Should return a tuple with all values as nothing\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([30, 30, 30]))  # Should return stable trend with same values\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([15, 20, 25, 30]))  # Should return increasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([35, 30, 25, 20]))  # Should return decreasing trend\n```\n\nBy running these tests, I can confirm if the function behaves as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[254,541],"elapsed":6.048651542,"cost":0.0003627,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-682130713,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
