Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, I'll follow the outlined steps:\n\n1. **Think through the approach step by step:**\n   - Check if the list is empty; if yes, return a named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n   - Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package.\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the temperatures at the start and end of the list.\n   - Construct and return a named tuple with the results.\n\n2. **Write the necessary functions and code:**\n   - Import the `Statistics` module.\n   - Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function that includes the necessary calculations.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n   - Implement the function as per the analysis.\n\n4. **Check that the solution is correct:**\n   - Test the function using the provided data as well as some additional test cases.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with provided data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n\n# Additional test cases\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([]))  # Should return all 'nothing'\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20, 21, 22]))  # Increasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([22, 21, 20]))  # Decreasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20, 20, 20]))  # Stable trend\n```\n\nRunning the code will allow me to verify the correctness of the implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[254,450],"elapsed":5.451566792,"cost":0.0003081,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-605510620,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
