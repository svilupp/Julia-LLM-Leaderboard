X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task of analyzing daily temperature data, we'll proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Recall Useful Julia Snippets**: We will need to use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures. For the trend analysis, we'll check if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: We will define a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures, performs the required calculations, and returns a named tuple with the results.\n\n3. **Double-check the Solution**: Ensure the logic for trend analysis is sound and the function handles an empty list appropriately.\n\nHere's the complete solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(temps[i] < temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] > temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function starts by checking if the input `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n- It then computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` standard library.\n- For the trend determination, it uses comprehensions and the `all` function to check if the series of temperatures is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or stable (not strictly increasing or decreasing).\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the statistical results.\n\n### Double-Checking the Solution:\n- The function handles empty input correctly.\n- The statistics computations (average, max, min) leverage standard library functions which are robust.\n- The trend calculation is based on proper logic of comparisons between consecutive elements in the temperatures list.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and follows best practices in Julia.
