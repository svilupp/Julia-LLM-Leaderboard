Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem step by step, I'll follow the outlined approach:\n\n1. **Think through the approach**:\n   - Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package.\n   - Determine the trend by checking if the first temperature is less than, greater than, or equal to the last temperature.\n   - If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code needed**.\n3. **Solve the task**.\n4. **Check that the solution is correct**.\n\nNow let's write the code.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if temps[1] < temps[end]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n\n# Example data provided in the task\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of code:\n- The function `weather_data_analyzer` accepts a vector of temperatures.\n- It checks if the vector is empty, returning a tuple of `nothing` if so.\n- It calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n- It determines the trend based on the first and last temperature values.\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple with the results.\n\n### Check the solution:\nLet's run the function with the provided example data and verify the output.\n\nRunning the function with the provided example `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]` should yield:\n- Average: 23.4\n- Max: 27\n- Min: 20\n- Trend: :decreasing \n\nNow let's confirm by executing the above code. \n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:decreasing)\n``` \n\nThe implementation needs to be checked to ensure correctness by running this output confirmation.","status":200,"tokens":[254,530],"elapsed":5.480750666,"cost":0.0003561,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":565244936,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
