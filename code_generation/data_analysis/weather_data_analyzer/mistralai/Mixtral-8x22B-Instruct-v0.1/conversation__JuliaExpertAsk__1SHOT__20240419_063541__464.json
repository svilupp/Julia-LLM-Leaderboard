Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that performs the required statistical analyses:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if avg > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif avg < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf `temps` is not empty, the function calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package. It also finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively.\n\nThe trend is determined by comparing the average temperature to the first temperature in the list. If the average is greater than the first temperature, the trend is `:increasing`. If the average is less than the first temperature, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[203,362],"elapsed":19.170898792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1815038988,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
