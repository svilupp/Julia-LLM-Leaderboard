Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that performs the required statistical analyses and returns the results in a named tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if avg > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif avg < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\njulia> weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is. If the list is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature to the first temperature in the list. If the average is greater than the first temperature, the trend is `:increasing`. If the average is less than the first temperature, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the average is equal to the first temperature, the trend is `:stable`. The results are then returned in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[299,425],"elapsed":10.576154375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":320880483,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
