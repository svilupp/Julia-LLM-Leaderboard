Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to the problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        diffs = diff(temps)\n        if all(diffs .>= 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diffs .<= 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector `temps` of real numbers as input.\n2. It first checks if the `temps` vector is empty using the `isempty` function. If it is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` using the `(; key1=nothing, key2=nothing, ...)` syntax.\n3. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n4. It finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively.\n5. To determine the trend:\n   - If there is only one temperature value in `temps`, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates the differences between consecutive temperature values using the `diff` function.\n   - If all the differences are greater than or equal to zero, the trend is set to `:increasing`.\n   - If all the differences are less than or equal to zero, the trend is set to `:decreasing`.\n   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n6. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)` syntax.\n\nThe function uses the `Statistics` package to perform the statistical calculations. It handles the case when `temps` is empty by returning a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend is determined based on the differences between consecutive temperature values.","status":200,"tokens":[181,570],"elapsed":23.001870166,"cost":0.045465,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18496,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
