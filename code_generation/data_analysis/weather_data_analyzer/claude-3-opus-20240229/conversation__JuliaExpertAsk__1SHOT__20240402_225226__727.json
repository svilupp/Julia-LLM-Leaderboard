Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution to the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        increasing = issorted(temps)\n        decreasing = issorted(reverse(temps))\n        trend = increasing ? :increasing : decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We first check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` using the syntax `(average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)`.\n\n2. If the list is not empty, we calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n\n3. We find the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\n4. To determine the trend, we first check the length of the list. If the length is 1, we set the trend to `:stable` since there is only one data point.\n\n5. If the length is greater than 1, we check if the list is sorted in ascending order using the `issorted` function. If it is, we set the trend to `:increasing`.\n\n6. If the list is not sorted in ascending order, we check if it is sorted in descending order by reversing the list and using `issorted`. If it is, we set the trend to `:decreasing`.\n\n7. If the list is not sorted in either ascending or descending order, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n\n8. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values using the syntax `(average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)`.\n\nThe function takes a vector of real numbers (`Vector{<:Real}`) as input and returns a named tuple with the statistical analysis results. The `trend` field in the named tuple can only have one of three values: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,572],"elapsed":20.589818,"cost":0.045614999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":31308,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
