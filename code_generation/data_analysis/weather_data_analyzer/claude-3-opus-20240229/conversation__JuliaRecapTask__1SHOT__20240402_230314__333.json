[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n   - Use `using Statistics` to import the Statistics package\n   - Named tuple syntax: `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`\n   - Statistical functions: `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = if length(temps) < 2\n        :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end] \n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (;average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check the solution:\n   - The function takes a vector of real numbers (`Vector{<:Real}`) as input\n   - It handles the empty list case by returning a named tuple with `nothing` values\n   - It calculates the average, max, and min using the Statistics package functions\n   - The trend is determined by comparing the first and last elements:\n     - If length is less than 2, trend is `:stable` \n     - If first < last, trend is `:increasing`\n     - If first > last, trend is `:decreasing`\n     - Otherwise, trend is `:stable`\n   - It returns the results in a named tuple\n\nI believe this solution should correctly implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function according to the problem description.
