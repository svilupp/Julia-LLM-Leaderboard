Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to the problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        if all(diff(temps) .>= 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .<= 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector `temps` of real numbers as input.\n\n2. If the `temps` vector is empty, the function immediately returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n3. If the `temps` vector is not empty, the function proceeds to calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package, the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function, and the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n\n4. To determine the trend:\n   - If the `temps` vector has only one element, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n   - If all the differences between consecutive elements in `temps` are non-negative (checked using `diff(temps) .>= 0`), the trend is set to `:increasing`.\n   - If all the differences between consecutive elements in `temps` are non-positive (checked using `diff(temps) .<= 0`), the trend is set to `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n\nThis solution efficiently analyzes the temperature data and returns the required statistical information in a named tuple format. It handles the case of an empty input vector by returning a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,537],"elapsed":21.919531959,"cost":0.04299,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-444,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
