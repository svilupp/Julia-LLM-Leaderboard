Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution to the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        diffs = diff(temps)\n        if all(diffs .>= 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diffs .<= 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function takes a vector of real numbers `temps` as input.\n\n2. If `temps` is empty, the function immediately returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n3. If `temps` is not empty, the function calculates:\n   - `avg`: the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n   - `max_temp`: the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function.\n   - `min_temp`: the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n\n4. To determine the `trend`:\n   - If `temps` has only one element, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n   - Otherwise, the function calculates the differences between consecutive temperatures using the `diff` function.\n   - If all differences are greater than or equal to zero, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If all differences are less than or equal to zero, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - If the differences have both positive and negative values, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n\nThis function efficiently analyzes the temperature data and returns the required statistical information in a named tuple format.","status":200,"tokens":[181,507],"elapsed":18.267598834,"cost":0.04074,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-16678,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
