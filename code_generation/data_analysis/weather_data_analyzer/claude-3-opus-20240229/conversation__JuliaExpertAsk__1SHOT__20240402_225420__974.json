Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to the problem using the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        diffs = diff(temps)\n        if all(diffs .>= 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diffs .<= 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We first check if the input `temps` list is empty using `isempty(temps)`. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. If `temps` is not empty, we calculate the average temperature using `mean(temps)` from the `Statistics` package.\n3. We find the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)` respectively.\n4. To determine the trend, we first check if `temps` has only one element. If so, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n5. If `temps` has more than one element, we calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures using `diff(temps)`.\n   - If all differences are greater than or equal to zero, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If all differences are less than or equal to zero, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n6. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nThe function uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean, maximum, and minimum values. It handles empty input by returning a named tuple with `nothing` values.","status":200,"tokens":[181,489],"elapsed":19.988373958,"cost":0.03939,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-7492,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
