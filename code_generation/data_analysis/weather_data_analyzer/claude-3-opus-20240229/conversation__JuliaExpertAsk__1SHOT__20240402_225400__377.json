Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if length(temps) < 2\n        :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function takes a vector of `Float64` numbers representing the daily temperature data.\n2. It first checks if the `temps` list is empty using the `isempty` function. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. If the `temps` list is not empty, the function calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n4. It finds the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function and the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n5. To determine the trend, the function checks the length of `temps`. If it has less than 2 elements, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n6. If the last temperature is greater than the first temperature, the trend is `:increasing`.\n7. If the last temperature is less than the first temperature, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n8. If the last temperature is equal to the first temperature (and the length is at least 2), the trend is `:stable`.\n9. Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nThe function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures efficiently. The trend is determined based on comparing the first and last temperatures in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[181,493],"elapsed":17.566310583,"cost":0.039689999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-5976,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
