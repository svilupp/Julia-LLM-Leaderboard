Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs the desired statistical analysis on the given temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend\n    diff_temps = diff(temps)\n    num_increasing = sum(diff_temps .> 0)\n    num_decreasing = sum(diff_temps .< 0)\n\n    if num_increasing > num_decreasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif num_increasing < num_decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures.
