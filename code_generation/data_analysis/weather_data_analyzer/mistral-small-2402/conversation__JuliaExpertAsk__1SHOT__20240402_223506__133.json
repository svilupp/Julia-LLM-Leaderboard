Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # calculate trend\n    diff_temps = diff(temps)\n    if all(diff_temps .>= 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff_temps .<= 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of floating-point numbers as input (`temps`) and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend. If the input vector is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThe `Statistics` package is used to calculate the average temperature, and the built-in `maximum` and `minimum` functions are used to find the maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively.\n\nThe trend is calculated by taking the difference between consecutive temperatures in the vector and checking if all the differences are positive (`:increasing`), negative (`:decreasing`), or both positive and negative (`:stable`).\n\nThe returned named tuple is constructed using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax. The type annotations for the function and the return value are included for clarity and type stability.","status":200,"tokens":[194,455],"elapsed":4.974832791,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1708546049,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
