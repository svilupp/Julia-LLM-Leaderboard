Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that follows your problem-solving approach and the given task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    trend = if sorted_temps == temps\n        :stable\n    elseif sorted_temps == reverse(temps)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :increasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a vector of floating-point numbers `temps` as input and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a trend.
