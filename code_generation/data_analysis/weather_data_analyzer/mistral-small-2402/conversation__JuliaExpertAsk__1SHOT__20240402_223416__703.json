Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff_temps = diff(temps)\n    positive_diff = count(x -> x > 0, diff_temps)\n    negative_diff = count(x -> x < 0, diff_temps)\n\n    if positive_diff > negative_diff\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif positive_diff < negative_diff\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of temperatures as input, checks if it's empty, and if not, calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package. It also determines the trend of the temperature data by calculating the difference between consecutive temperatures and checking if the number of positive differences is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of negative differences.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the trend.
