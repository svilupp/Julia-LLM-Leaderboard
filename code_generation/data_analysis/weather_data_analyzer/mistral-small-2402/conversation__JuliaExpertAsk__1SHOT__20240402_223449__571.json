Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diff = diff(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(all(diff .>= 0), :increasing, ifelse(all(diff .<= 0), :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nHere is a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The function takes a vector of floats `temps` as input and returns a named tuple with four fields: `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n* If the input vector is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n* If the input vector is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n* The function also calculates the trend of the temperatures by taking the difference of consecutive elements in the vector using the `diff` function and checking if all differences are positive, negative, or neither.\n* Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[194,428],"elapsed":4.662546958,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1917076997,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
