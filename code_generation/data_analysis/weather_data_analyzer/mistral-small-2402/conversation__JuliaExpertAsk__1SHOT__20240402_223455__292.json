Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Float64, Nothing}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        diff = diff(temps)\n        positive, zero, negative = 0, 0, 0\n\n        for d in diff\n            if d > 0\n                positive += 1\n            elseif d < 0\n                negative += 1\n            else\n                zero += 1\n            end\n        end\n\n        trend = if positive > negative\n            :increasing\n        elseif negative > positive\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, it calculates the difference between consecutive temperatures using the `diff` function. It then counts the number of positive, zero, and negative differences. If there are more positive differences than negative ones, the trend is `:increasing`. If there are more negative differences, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the number of positive and negative differences is equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend. The types of the values are specified in the function signature using the `Union` type. This allows the function to return `nothing` if the input list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[194,526],"elapsed":5.951851541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":438599087,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
