Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution to your problem using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Float64, Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Union{Int, Nothing}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate trend.\n    # If all differences are positive, trend is increasing.\n    # If all differences are negative, trend is decreasing.\n    # If there are both positive and negative differences, trend is stable.\n    differences = diff(temps)\n    positive = all(dif -> dif > 0, differences)\n    negative = all(dif -> dif < 0, differences)\n\n    trend = if positive\n        :increasing\n    elseif negative\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis script defines a `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes a vector of integers as input, performs the required statistical analyses using the `Statistics` package, and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and trend.
