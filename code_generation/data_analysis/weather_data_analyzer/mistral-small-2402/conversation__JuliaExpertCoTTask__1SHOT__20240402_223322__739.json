Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I will follow the problem-solving steps you provided and write the Julia code using the `Statistics` package. Here's the code snippet:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(sorted_temps == reverse(sorted_temps), :stable,\n                   sorted_temps[end] > temps[end] ? :increasing : :decreasing)\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresults = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(results)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a vector of floating-point numbers as input. If the input vector is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the input vector is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package and determines the trend of the temperatures.\n\nThe trend of the temperatures is determined by comparing the sorted temperatures with the original temperature list and the last temperature. If the sorted temperatures are the same as the original list, the trend is `:stable`. If the last temperature is less than the maximum temperature in the sorted list, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend. In the example usage, the function is called with the input vector `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, and the results are printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[290,539],"elapsed":6.080503167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-953179452,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
