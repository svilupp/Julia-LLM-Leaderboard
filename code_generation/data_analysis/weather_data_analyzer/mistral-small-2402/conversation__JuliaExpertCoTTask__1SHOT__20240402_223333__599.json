Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that fulfills the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the difference between consecutive temperatures\n    diff = diff(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    trend = ifelse(all(d -> d >= 0, diff), :increasing,\n                  ifelse(all(d -> d <= 0, diff), :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function calculates the difference between consecutive temperatures using the `diff` function, and then uses the `all` function to check if all differences are non-negative (indicating an increasing trend), non-positive (indicating a decreasing trend), or neither (indicating a stable trend).\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[290,438],"elapsed":4.888886166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1548896820,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
