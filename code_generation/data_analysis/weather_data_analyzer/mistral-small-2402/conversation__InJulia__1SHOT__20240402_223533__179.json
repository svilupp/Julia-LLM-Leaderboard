If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThe function uses the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, respectively. It also uses the `diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive temperature readings, and checks whether all the differences are positive, negative, or neither to determine the trend in the data.\n\nHere is an example of how the function could be used:\n```\ntemps = [20, 22, 24, 22, 20]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)\n# Output: (average = 21.4, max = 24, min = 20, trend = :stable)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[153,415],"elapsed":10.198987541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":369521756,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
