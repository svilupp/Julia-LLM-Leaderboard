Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Define a helper function to calculate the difference between adjacent elements\n    diff(x) = [x[i+1] - x[i] for i in 1:length(x)-1]\n\n    # Calculate the trend based on the differences between adjacent elements\n    diff_temps = diff(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(all(diff_temps .> 0), :increasing, ifelse(all(diff_temps .< 0), :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package and stores the results in corresponding variables.\n\nNext, it defines a helper function `diff` that calculates the difference between adjacent elements in a given vector. It then uses this helper function to calculate the differences between adjacent temperatures in the input list and determines the trend based on these differences. If all differences are positive, the trend is set to `:increasing`; if all differences are negative, the trend is set to `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[194,480],"elapsed":5.237622208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":284284123,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
