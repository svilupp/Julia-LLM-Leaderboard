Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task in Julia, I would follow the outlined problem-solving steps and utilize the Statistics package for the statistical analyses.
