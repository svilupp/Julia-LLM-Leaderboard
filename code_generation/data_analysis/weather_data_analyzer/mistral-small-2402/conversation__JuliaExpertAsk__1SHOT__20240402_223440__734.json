Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To perform the statistical analyses and return the required named tuple, you can use the following Julia code.

It uses the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, respectively. The `sort` and `diff` functions are used to calculate the trend of the temperature data.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.
