Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    minimum::Union{Float64, Nothing} \n    maximum::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    length(temps)==0 && return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if length(unique(diff(temps))) == 1\n        if mean(diff(temps)) > 0\n            :increasing\n        elseif mean(diff(temps)) < 0 \n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return WeatherData(average, min, max, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis first checks if the input `temps` is empty, in which case it returns a `WeatherData` namedtuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n\nIf there is data, it calculates the mean, max, and min temperatures. It then looks at the diff of temperatures to determine if there is a trend. If the diff is all the same sign, it's a trend. The sign of the mean diff indicates if it is increasing or decreasing. If the diff varies, the trend is stable.\n\nThe results are returned in a `WeatherData` namedtuple.","status":200,"tokens":[181,301],"elapsed":9.407618334,"cost":0.008672000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-8761,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
