Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    minimum::Union{Float64, Nothing} \n    maximum::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 0\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n\n    trend = if n â‰¥ 2\n        first = temps[1]\n        last = temps[end]\n        if first < last\n            :increasing\n        elseif first > last \n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    else\n        nothing\n    end\n\n    return WeatherData(avg, min_temp, max_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis analyzes the input temperature data by calculating the mean, minimum, maximum temperatures and determining if there is an increasing, decreasing or stable trend. It handles the empty input case by returning a WeatherData tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. The trend logic compares the first and last elements of the input, if possible, to determine if temperatures are rising, falling or unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[181,277],"elapsed":8.367391042,"cost":0.008096,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26702,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
