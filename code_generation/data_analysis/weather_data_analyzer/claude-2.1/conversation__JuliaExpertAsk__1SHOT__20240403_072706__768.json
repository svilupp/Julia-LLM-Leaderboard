Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps) \n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    if issorted(temps)\n        trend = temps[1] == temps[end] ? :stable : (temps[1] < temps[end] ? :increasing : :decreasing)\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return WeatherData(average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis first checks if the input `temps` array is empty, in which case it returns a `WeatherData` named tuple with `nothing` values. \n\nIf there is data, it calculates the mean, max, and min temperatures using `Statistics` functions.
