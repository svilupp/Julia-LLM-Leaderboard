Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysis\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    minimum::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    maximum::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysis(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    \n    if issorted(temps)\n        trend = temps[1] < temps[end] ? :increasing : :decreasing \n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return WeatherDataAnalysis(average, minimum, maximum, trend)\nend\n```\n\nTo test:\n\n```julia\ndata1 = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\ndata2 = weather_data_analyzer([])\n```\n\nThe key steps:\n\n1.
