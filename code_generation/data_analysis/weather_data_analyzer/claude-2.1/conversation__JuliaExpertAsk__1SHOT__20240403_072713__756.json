Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    maxi::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    mini::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxi = maximum(temps)\n    mini = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diff = maxi - mini\n    if diff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return WeatherData(average, maxi, mini, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis uses a named tuple struct `WeatherData` to hold the return values. It checks if the input `temps` is empty, and if so returns a tuple of `nothing` values. Otherwise it calculates the mean, max, min of the temperatures, and determines if there is an increasing, decreasing or stable trend by comparing the max and min. The results are returned in a `WeatherData` namedtuple.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","status":200,"tokens":[181,269],"elapsed":7.496644125,"cost":0.007904,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":30081,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
