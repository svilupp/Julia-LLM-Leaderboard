[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

We first check if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. We perform the statistical analysis using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n3. We determine the trend by checking the relationship between consecutive temperatures in the list. We use the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of consecutive temperatures. If all temperatures are increasing, we set the trend to `:increasing`. If all temperatures are decreasing, we set the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n4. We return the results as a named tuple using the `(; key=value)` syntax.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ntemps = [10, 12, 15, 18, 20]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (average = 15.0, max = 20, min = 10, trend = :increasing)\n\ntemps = []\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\nNote that I've used the `::NamedTuple` type annotation to specify the return type of the function. This is a good practice in Julia to make the code more readable and self-documenting.","status":200,"tokens":[404,536],"elapsed":4.361451125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1438071297,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
