Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    slope = (last(temps) - first(temps)) / (length(temps) - 1)\n    \n    if slope > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExplanation of the code:\n1. First, it checks if the input list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. It then calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n3. It calculates the trend of the temperature by comparing the last and first temperature values. If the slope is positive, the trend is `:increasing`, if it's negative, the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise it's `:stable`.\n4. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[258,328],"elapsed":2.357206375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1613965817,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
