Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

The trend is determined by checking if the maximum temperature is higher than the maximum of the rest of the list and the minimum temperature is lower than the minimum of the rest of the list. If this condition is true, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is determined by checking the opposite condition, which would indicate a `:decreasing` trend. If neither of these conditions is true, the trend is `:stable`. The results are then returned as a named tuple.\n\nYou can run this code to test the function with the provided example.","status":200,"tokens":[258,430],"elapsed":3.661750458,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1351041259,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
