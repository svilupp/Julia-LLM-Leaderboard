Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\nWeather Data Analyzer\nJulia 1.0","status":200,"tokens":[202,18],"elapsed":0.523670875,"cost":0.000198,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":158452116,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
