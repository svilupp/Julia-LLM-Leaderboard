Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Think through your approach step by step\n- Calculate the average of the temperatures using `Statistics.mean`\n- Find the maximum temperature using `Statistics.maximum`\n- Find the minimum temperature using `Statistics.minimum`\n- Identify the weather trend by looking at the signs of differences between consecutive temperatures:\n\t- If all differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`\n\t- If all differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`\n\t- If there are both positive and negative differences, the trend is `:stable`\n- Check if the input list is empty to handle the corner case\n- Construct the result tuple using `(; key1=value1, key2=value2...)` syntax\n\n# Write any functions and other code you need\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (","status":200,"tokens":[298,200],"elapsed":3.537719791,"cost":0.0004482,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-62719599,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
