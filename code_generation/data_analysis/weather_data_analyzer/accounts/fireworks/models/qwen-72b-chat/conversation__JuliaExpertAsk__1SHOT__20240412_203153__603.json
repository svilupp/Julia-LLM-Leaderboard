If it is, I will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. To do that, I will use the `isempty` function.\nNext, I will use the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures, respectively.\nFinally, to determine the `trend`, I will compare the first and last temperatures in the `temps` list.
