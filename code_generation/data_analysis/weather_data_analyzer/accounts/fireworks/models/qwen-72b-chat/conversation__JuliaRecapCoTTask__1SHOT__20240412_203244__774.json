[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

We'll need to load the `Statistics` package, which provides a variety of useful functions for statistical analysis. We'll also need to use the ` NamedTuple` syntax to create the output object with named fields.\nNext, we'll write the `weather_data_analyzer` function. We'll start by checking if the input list is empty, in which case we'll return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\nIf the list is not empty, we'll compute the average, max, and min temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\nFinally, we'll determine the trend of the data by comparing the maximum temperature with the first and last temperatures in the list. If the maximum temperature is greater than both the first and last temperatures, the trend is `:increasing`.
