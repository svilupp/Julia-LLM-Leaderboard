Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

The docstring at the beginning of the function provides an overview of the function's behavior, arguments, and return values. The function itself is designed to be readable and maintainable, with simple and intuitive variable names.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean and extremal values of the temperature data. The `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from this package are used for their respective tasks.\n\nWhen the input list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`, as requested. Otherwise, it performs the necessary calculations and returns the results as a named tuple.\n\nFinally, an example usage is provided at the end to demonstrate how to call the function with sample data and print the results.","status":200,"tokens":[146,503],"elapsed":66.414756125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2055813379,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
