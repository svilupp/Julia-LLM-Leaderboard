Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Import necessary packages\nWe need to import the Statistics package for calculating mean (average) of the temperatures. This can be done using `using Statistics` in Julia.\n\n## Step 2: Define the function\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` should take one argument, `temps`, which is a list (vector in Julia) of temperatures.\n\n## Step 3: Check if the input list is empty\nIf the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. We can check for an empty list using `isempty(temps)`.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate average temperature\nTo calculate the average temperature, we can use the `mean` function from the Statistics package.\n\n## Step 5: Find max and min temperatures\nThe `maximum` and `minimum` functions can be used to find the highest and lowest temperatures, respectively.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the trend\nTo determine the trend, we need to compare the first and last temperatures. If the last temperature is higher than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last temperature is lower than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the temperatures are the same, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n## Step 7: Return results in a named tuple\nWe can construct a named tuple with `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax to return the results.\n\n## Step 8: Implement the logic in Julia\nHere's how the function should look:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem as it involves writing a function in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[181,468],"elapsed":31.312265917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-275801201,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
