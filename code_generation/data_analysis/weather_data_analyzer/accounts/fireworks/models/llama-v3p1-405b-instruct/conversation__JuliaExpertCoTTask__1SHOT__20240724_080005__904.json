Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Import necessary packages\nWe need to import the Statistics package for calculating the mean of the temperatures.\n\n## Step 2: Define the function `weather_data_analyzer`\nThis function will take a list of temperatures as input, perform statistical analyses, and return a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the average, max, and min temperatures\nWe will use the `mean` function from the Statistics package to calculate the average temperature. The `maximum` and `minimum` functions will be used to find the max and min temperatures, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the trend\nWe will compare the first and last temperatures in the list to determine the trend. If the last temperature is greater than the first, the trend is increasing. If the last temperature is less than the first, the trend is decreasing. Otherwise, the trend is stable.\n\n## Step 5: Return the results as a named tuple\nWe will construct a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min temperatures, and the determined trend.\n\n## Step 6: Handle the case where the input list is empty\nIf the input list is empty, we will return a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\n## Step 7: Test the function with the provided data\nWe will test the function with the provided list of temperatures.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[258,448],"elapsed":52.707058,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-73801244,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
