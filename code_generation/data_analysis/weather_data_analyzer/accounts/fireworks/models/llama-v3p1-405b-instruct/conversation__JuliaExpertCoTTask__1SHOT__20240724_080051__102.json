Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Import necessary packages\nWe will need the Statistics package for calculating mean (average) of the temperatures. This step involves setting up our environment for the required statistical analyses.\n\n## Step 2: Define the function `weather_data_analyzer`\nThis function will take a list of daily temperature data `temps` and perform statistical analyses on it. The goal is to calculate the average, max, min temperatures, and determine the trend of the temperatures.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the average temperature\nWe use the `mean` function from the Statistics package to calculate the average temperature. If the list is empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the max and min temperatures\nWe use the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the highest and lowest temperatures, respectively.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the trend of the temperatures\nTo determine the trend, we compare the first and last temperatures in the list. If the last temperature is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last temperature is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the last temperature is equal to the first, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n## Step 6: Return the results in a named tuple\nWe construct a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min temperatures, and the determined trend.\n\n## Step 7: Test the function with the given data\nWe call the function with the provided list of daily temperature data `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`.\n\n## Code\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n## Answer\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` returns a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min temperatures, and the determined trend.\n\nThe final answer is: \n$(; average=22.6, max=27, min=20, trend=:decreasing)","status":200,"tokens":[258,549],"elapsed":45.223989125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-492082069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
