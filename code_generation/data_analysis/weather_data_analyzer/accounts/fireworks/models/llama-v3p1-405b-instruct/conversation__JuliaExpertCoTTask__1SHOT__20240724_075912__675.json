Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Import necessary packages\nWe will need the Statistics package for calculating mean.\n\n## Step 2: Define the function weather_data_analyzer\nThis function will take a list of temperatures as input and return a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend.\n\n## Step 3: Check if the input list is empty\nIf the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the average, max, and min temperatures\nUse the mean function from the Statistics package to calculate the average temperature, and the built-in max and min functions to find the maximum and minimum temperatures.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the trend\nCompare the first and last temperatures to determine the trend. If the first temperature is less than the last, the trend is increasing. If the first temperature is greater than the last, the trend is decreasing. If the first and last temperatures are equal, the trend is stable.\n\n## Step 6: Construct and return the named tuple\nUse the (; key1=value1, key2=value2) syntax to construct a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min temperatures, and the trend.\n\n## Step 7: Test the function\nCall the weather_data_analyzer function with the provided list of temperatures and check the result.\n\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[258,426],"elapsed":37.019478208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1533908551,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
