Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a code that satisfies the problem requirements:\n\n```julia\n# Import the necessary package\nusing Statistics: mean, median\n\n# Define the function to analyze the weather data\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate the average of the temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend of the temperatures\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\ndata = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(data)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nYou can get rid of it if you feel it is irrelevant.","status":200,"tokens":[258,266],"elapsed":0.98227925,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-520968161,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
