Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataResult\n    average::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    max::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    min::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    trend::Union{Nothing, Symbol}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = nothing\n    else\n        diff = temps[2:end] .- temps[1:end-1]\n        trend = if all(diff .> 0)\n            :increasing\n        elseif all(diff .< 0)\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return WeatherDataResult(avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis code defines a struct `WeatherDataResult` to hold the results, with type annotations for each field to ensure they can represent `nothing` or the actual values. \n\nIn the `weather_data_analyzer` function, it first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, the function returns a `WeatherDataResult` with all fields set to `nothing`.\n\nOtherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using Julia's `Statistics` package. \n\nNext, it determines the trend by calculating the differences between consecutive temperatures and checking if these differences are all positive, negative, or neither. \n\nFinally, it returns a `WeatherDataResult` with the calculated values.\n\nNote: The `all(diff .> 0)` and `all(diff .< 0)` checks use Julia's broadcasting feature to apply the comparison to each element of the vector `diff` simultaneously. If `all(diff .> 0)` is true, it means all elements in `diff` are greater than 0, which indicates a trend of increasing temperature. Similarly, `all(diff .< 0)` checks for a trend of decreasing temperature.","status":200,"tokens":[181,444],"elapsed":1.663917541,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-97061163,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
