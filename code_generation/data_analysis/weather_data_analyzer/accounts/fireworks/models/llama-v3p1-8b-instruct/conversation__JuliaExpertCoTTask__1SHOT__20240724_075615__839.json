Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that follows the specified approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\n# Define a function for weather data analysis\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        return (average = nothing, maximum = nothing, minimum = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # calculate maximum, minimum temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # calculate average temperature\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n\n    # determine temperature trend\n    trend = :stable\n    diff = temps[2] - temps[1]\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        temp_diff = temps[i] - temps[i - 1]\n        if diff > 0 && temp_diff > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n            break\n        elseif diff < 0 && temp_diff < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n            break\n        elseif diff != temp_diff\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n    diff = temps[2] - temps[1]\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Use the function\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nYou can put the above code in a file and run it in a Julia environment.","status":200,"tokens":[258,297],"elapsed":1.085582,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1290405977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
