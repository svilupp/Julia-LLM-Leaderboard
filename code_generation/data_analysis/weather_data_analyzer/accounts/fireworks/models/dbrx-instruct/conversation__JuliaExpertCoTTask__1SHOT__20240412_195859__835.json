Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I'll follow the problem-solving steps you've outlined. Here's how I'll approach this task:\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n   - I'll need to define a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as input.\n   - Within the function, I'll use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures.\n   - I'll also need to determine the trend of the temperatures. I can do this by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list. If they're the same, the trend is `:stable`. If the first one is smaller, the trend is `:increasing`. If the first one is larger, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - I'll return the results in a named tuple, as specified.\n\n2.
