Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. First, I will import the Statistics package.\n2. Next, I will define the `weather_data_analyzer` function, which will take a list of temperatures as an argument.\n3. Inside the function, I will calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package.\n4. I will also calculate the trend by checking if the difference between the first and last elements of the sorted temperature list is positive, negative, or zero. If positive, the trend is increasing, if negative, the trend is decreasing, and if zero, the trend is stable.\n5.
