Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Problem Solving Steps\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step:**\n   - Check if the list is empty.\n   - If empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n   - Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package.\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last temperatures.\n   - Return the results in a named tuple.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n\n```julia\n# Test with the provided data\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n# Expected output: (average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n\n# Test with an empty list\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([]))\n# Expected output: (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n\n# Test with a stable trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 25, 25, 25, 25]))\n# Expected output: (average = 25.0, max = 25, min = 25, trend = :stable)\n\n# Test with an increasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20, 22, 24, 26, 28]))\n# Expected output: (average = 24.0, max = 28, min = 20, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the function handles various cases correctly and provides the expected results.","status":200,"tokens":[290,649],"elapsed":13.796954792,"cost":0.006711,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2074516315,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
