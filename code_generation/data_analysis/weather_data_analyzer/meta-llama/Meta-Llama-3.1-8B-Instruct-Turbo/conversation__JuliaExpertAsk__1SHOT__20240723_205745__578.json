Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        trend = if avg > mean(temps[1:3]) && avg > mean(temps[end-2:end])\n            :increasing\n        elseif avg < mean(temps[1:3]) && avg < mean(temps[end-2:end])\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n\n        (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nNote that I used the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average temperature, and the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find the max and min temperatures. I also used the `isempty` function to check if the input list is empty. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature with the average of the first three and last three temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[182,241],"elapsed":1.602086125,"cost":6.158e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":872914046,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
