Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

It first checks if the list is empty, and if so, returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list, and by checking if the temperatures are increasing or decreasing. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[259,330],"elapsed":2.541279125,"cost":8.53e-5,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":1388575907,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
