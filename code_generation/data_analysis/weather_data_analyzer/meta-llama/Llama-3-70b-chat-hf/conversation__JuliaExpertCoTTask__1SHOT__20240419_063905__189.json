Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines the trend by checking if the differences between consecutive temperatures are all positive (increasing), all negative (decreasing), or neither (stable). Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[259,281],"elapsed":3.517575792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1338602667,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
