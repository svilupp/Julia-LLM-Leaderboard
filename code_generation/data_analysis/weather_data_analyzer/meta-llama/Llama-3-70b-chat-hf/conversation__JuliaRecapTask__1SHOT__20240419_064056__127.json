X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

First, we import the `Statistics` package, which provides functions for statistical analysis.\n2. We define the `weather_data_analyzer` function, which takes a vector of numbers `temps` as input.\n3. We check if the input vector is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. If the vector is not empty, we calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n5. We determine the trend by checking the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all differences are positive, the trend is increasing. If all differences are negative, the trend is decreasing. Otherwise, the trend is stable.\n6. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.\n\nNote that I used the `Vector{<:Number}` type annotation to specify that the input vector can contain any type of number (e.g., `Int`, `Float64`, etc.). This allows the function to work with different types of temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[405,403],"elapsed":4.952756333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1883951560,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
