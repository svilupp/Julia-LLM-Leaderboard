Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```\n\nLet me explain what I did:\n\n1. I checked if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, I returned a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. I calculated the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n3. I determined the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the `temps` list. If the first element is less than the last element, the trend is `:increasing`. If the first element is greater than the last element, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n4. I returned a named tuple containing the calculated values.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list `temps` is a vector of numbers. If the input list can contain non-numeric values, additional error handling may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[259,349],"elapsed":5.536382125,"cost":0.00653,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1848610587,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
