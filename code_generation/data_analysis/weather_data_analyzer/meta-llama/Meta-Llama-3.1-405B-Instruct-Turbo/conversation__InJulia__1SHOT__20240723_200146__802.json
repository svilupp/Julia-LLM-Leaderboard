If they are equal, the trend is `:stable`. If the first element is less than the last element, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n*   We return the results as a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n*   We provide an example usage of the function with a sample list of temperature data.\n\nThis code is well-structured, concise, and readable, making it easy to understand and use. The documentation is also clear and concise, providing a brief description of the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.","status":200,"tokens":[147,544],"elapsed":8.790009833,"cost":0.008895,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-1460447859,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
