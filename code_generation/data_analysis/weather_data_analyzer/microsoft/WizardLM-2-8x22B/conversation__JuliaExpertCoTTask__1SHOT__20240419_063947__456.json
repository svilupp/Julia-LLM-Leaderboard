Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. **Think through the approach step by step:**\n\n   - Import the `Statistics` package to use its functions for calculating the average, maximum, and minimum of the temperature data.\n   - Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes a list of temperatures as input.\n   - Check if the list is empty and return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is.\n   - Calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function.\n   - Calculate the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function.\n   - Calculate the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last temperatures in the list:\n     - If the last temperature is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`.\n     - If the last temperature is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n     - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n   - Return a named tuple with the calculated average, max, min, and trend.\n\n2. **Write the function and other code you need:**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    first_temp = temps[1]\n    last_temp = temps[end]\n    \n    if last_temp > first_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif last_temp < first_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n\n```julia\n# Given data\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\n\n# Analyze the weather data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n\n```julia\n# Check the result\nprintln(result)\n# Expected output: (average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nThe function should output the correct statistical analysis of the temperature data, including the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend. If the input list is empty, it should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[295,675],"elapsed":23.213713625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-351987615,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
