You can do this by running `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in the Julia REPL.\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe trend is determined by fitting a linear regression to the data using `linreg` from the `GLM` package (which is re-exported by `Statistics`). If the slope of the best-fit line is positive, the trend is `:increasing`; if it's negative, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`. Note that for a single data point or when all data points have the same value, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n\nRemember to handle edge cases appropriately in your actual implementation, such as when there is only one temperature value provided. In such cases, the trend should be `:stable` since there's not enough data to determine an increasing or decreasing trend.","status":200,"tokens":[199,619],"elapsed":27.604898167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"eos","run_id":-84925698,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
