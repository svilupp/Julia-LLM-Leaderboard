It first checks if the list is empty, and if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function compares the average temperature to the first and last temperatures in the list. If the average is greater than the last temperature, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. If the average is less than the first temperature, the trend is set to `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should return the following named tuple:\n\n```\n(average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:decreasing)\n```\n\nThe solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[297,484],"elapsed":4.510203792,"cost":0.0006792500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-18846,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
