Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if all(temps[1:end-1] .< temps[2:end])\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[1:end-1] .> temps[2:end])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` as input, and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) of the temperatures.\n\nIf the input list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThe function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum of the temperature data. It then checks the trend of the temperatures by comparing the values of consecutive days. If all temperatures are increasing, the trend is set to `:increasing`; if all temperatures are decreasing, the trend is set to `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the named tuple with the calculated results.","status":200,"tokens":[181,349],"elapsed":3.080939,"cost":0.00048150000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-13731,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
