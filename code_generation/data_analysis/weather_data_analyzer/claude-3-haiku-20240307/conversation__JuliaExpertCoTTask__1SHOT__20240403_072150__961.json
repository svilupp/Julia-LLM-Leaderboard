Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Think through your approach step by step\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Write any functions and other code you need\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Solve the task\n    if all(temps[2:end] .> temps[1:end-1])\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[2:end] .< temps[1:end-1])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Check that your solution is correct\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThe steps I followed:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step:**\n   - Check if the input list `temps` is empty.

For the provided example data, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and correctly identifies the trend as `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[263,558],"elapsed":4.993861375,"cost":0.00076325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":20989,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
