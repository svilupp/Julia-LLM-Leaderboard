[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n    \n    diff = mx - mn\n    if diff <= 1.0\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We first check if the input `temps` list is empty. If so, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. We then calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the `Statistics` package functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`, respectively.\n3. To determine the `trend`, we check the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the difference is less than or equal to 1.0, we consider the trend as `:stable`. Otherwise, we check if the first temperature is less than the last temperature, in which case the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n4. Finally, we return the results in a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n\nThis solution should work for the given task and meet the requirements.
