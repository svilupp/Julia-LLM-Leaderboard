[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) >= 3\n        first_three = temps[1:3]\n        last_three = temps[end-2:end]\n        if mean(last_three) > mean(first_three)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif mean(last_three) < mean(first_three)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the solution works:\n\n1. We first check if the input list `temps` is empty. If so, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. If the list is not empty, we calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the `mean()`, `maximum()`, and `minimum()` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\n3. To determine the `trend`, we check if the list has at least 3 elements. If so, we compare the mean of the first 3 elements with the mean of the last 3 elements:\n   - If the mean of the last 3 is greater than the mean of the first 3, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If the mean of the last 3 is less than the mean of the first 3, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - If the means are equal, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n4. If the list has less than 3 elements, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n\n5. Finally, we return the results as a named tuple.\n\nThis solution should work for the given task.
