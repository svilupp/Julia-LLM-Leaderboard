Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function that performs the requested analysis on the temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if all(temps[1] <= temp for temp in temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[1] >= temp for temp in temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty, in which case it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function checks if all the temperatures are either increasing or decreasing.
