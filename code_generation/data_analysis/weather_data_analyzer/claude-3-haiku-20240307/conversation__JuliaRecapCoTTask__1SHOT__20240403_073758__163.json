[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if diff(temps) |> all(x -> x > 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif diff(temps) |> all(x -> x < 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nLet's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we import the `Statistics` package, which provides useful functions like `mean()`, `maximum()`, and `minimum()`.\n\n2. The `weather_data_analyzer` function takes a list of daily temperatures `temps` as input.\n\n3. If the `temps` list is empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n4. Otherwise, we calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the appropriate functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\n5. To determine the `trend`, we calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures using `diff(temps)`. If all the differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`; if all the differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n6. Finally, we return a named tuple containing the calculated values.\n\nThis solution should work for the given task.
