Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we'll write the function and import the necessary package.\n2. Then we'll calculate the required statistics.\n3. We'll determine the trend.\n4. Finally, we'll return the results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        first_half = temps[1:div(end,2)]\n        second_half = temps[div(end,2)+1:end]\n        if mean(second_half) > mean(first_half)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif mean(second_half) < mean(first_half)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output something like:\n```\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nLet's also test with an empty list to ensure it handles that case correctly:\n\n```julia\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer([])\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n(average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` now correctly analyzes the temperature data, calculating the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as determining the overall trend. It also handles the case of an empty input list as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[263,498],"elapsed":6.60540125,"cost":0.008259,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-9429,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
