Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we'll define the function and import the necessary package.\n2. We'll handle the empty list case.\n3. We'll calculate the required statistics.\n4. We'll determine the trend.\n5. Finally, we'll return the results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        if all(diff(temps) .≥ 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .≤ 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n\n# Test with empty list\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer(Float64[])\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\nLet's check if the solution is correct:\n\n1. The function handles both non-empty and empty lists.\n2. It calculates the average, max, and min temperatures correctly.\n3. It determines the trend based on the temperature changes:\n   - If all differences are non-negative, it's increasing.\n   - If all differences are non-positive, it's decreasing.\n   - Otherwise, it's stable.\n4. For a single temperature, it considers the trend as stable.\n5. It returns the results in a named tuple as required.\n\nThe function should work correctly for the given example and other cases. You can test it with different inputs to verify its behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[263,487],"elapsed":7.112554792,"cost":0.008094,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":32642,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
