Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution following the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through the approach:\n   - Import the Statistics package\n   - Define the function with the given name\n   - Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n   - Determine the trend\n   - Return results as a named tuple\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) > 1\n        if all(diff(temps) .>= 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .<= 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3.
