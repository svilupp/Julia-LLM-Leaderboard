X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

I'll solve it step by step using Julia, following the given instructions. Let's start by recalling some useful Julia snippets and then implement the solution.\n\nUseful Julia snippets:\n- Named tuple construction: `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`\n- Statistics package: `using Statistics`\n- Mean calculation: `mean(array)`\n- Maximum and minimum: `maximum(array)`, `minimum(array)`\n- Trend calculation: We can use `isless` for comparison\n\nNow, let's solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        differences = diff(temps)\n        if all(>=(0), differences)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(<=(0), differences)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We start by importing the `Statistics` package to use the `mean` function.\n\n2. We define the function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a vector of numbers as input.\n\n3. We first check if the input vector is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n4. If the vector is not empty, we calculate the average using `mean(temps)`, the maximum using `maximum(temps)`, and the minimum using `minimum(temps)`.\n\n5. To determine the trend, we first check if the vector has less than 2 elements. If so, we consider it stable.\n\n6. For vectors with 2 or more elements, we calculate the differences between consecutive elements using `diff(temps)`.\n\n7. We then check if all differences are non-negative (increasing), non-positive (decreasing), or mixed (stable).\n\n8. Finally, we return a named tuple with all the calculated values.\n\nThis solution meets all the requirements:\n- It uses the `Statistics` package for statistical analysis.\n- It returns results in a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n- It handles empty input by returning a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- The trend is determined as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n- It uses general type annotations (`Vector{<:Number}`) to allow for different numeric types.\n\nTo double-check the correctness, we can test the function with some sample inputs:\n\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([]))  # Empty input\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20.5]))  # Single element\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20.5, 21.0, 21.5, 22.0]))  # Increasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25.0, 24.0, 23.0, 22.0]))  # Decreasing trend\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([20.0, 21.0, 20.5, 21.5]))  # Stable trend\n```\n\nThese test cases cover the main scenarios and should help verify that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[432,832],"elapsed":12.331838959,"cost":0.013776,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":18279,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
