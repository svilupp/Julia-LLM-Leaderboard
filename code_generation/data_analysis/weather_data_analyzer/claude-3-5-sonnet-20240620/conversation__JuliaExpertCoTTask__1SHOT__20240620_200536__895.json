Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we'll import the necessary package and define our function.\n2. We'll check if the input list is empty and return appropriate results.\n3. If not empty, we'll calculate the required statistics.\n4. We'll determine the trend based on the first and last elements of the list.\n5. Finally, we'll return the results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output something like:\n```\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nLet's also test with an empty list to ensure it handles that case correctly:\n\n```julia\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer([])\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n(average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` now correctly handles both non-empty and empty input lists, performs the required statistical analyses, determines the trend, and returns the results in a named tuple as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[263,449],"elapsed":6.13023925,"cost":0.007524,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":28933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
