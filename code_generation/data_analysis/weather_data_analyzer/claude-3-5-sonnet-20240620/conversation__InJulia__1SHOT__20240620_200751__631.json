It first checks if the input vector `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. If `temps` is not empty, it calculates the mean (average), maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\n3. To determine the trend, it splits the data into two halves and compares their means:\n   - If the means are approximately equal (within a tolerance of 0.1), it's considered stable.\n   - If the second half's mean is greater, it's considered increasing.\n   - If the first half's mean is greater, it's considered decreasing.\n   - If there's only one temperature in the list, it's considered stable by default.\n\n4. Finally, it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [20.5, 21.0, 22.5, 23.0, 22.0, 21.5, 23.5]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output something like:\n```\n(average = 22.0, max = 23.5, min = 20.5, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nAnd for an empty list:\n\n```julia\nempty_temps = Float64[]\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer(empty_temps)\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n(average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\n\nThis implementation should meet all the requirements you specified.","status":200,"tokens":[144,678],"elapsed":8.36440175,"cost":0.010602,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":19617,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
