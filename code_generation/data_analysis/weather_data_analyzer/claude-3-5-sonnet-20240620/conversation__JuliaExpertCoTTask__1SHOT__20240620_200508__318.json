Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we'll import the necessary package and define our function.\n2. We'll handle the empty list case.\n3. We'll calculate the required statistics.\n4. We'll determine the trend.\n5. Finally, we'll return the results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .≥ 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .≤ 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test our function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis should output something like:\n```\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :stable)\n```\n\nLet's also test with an empty list to ensure our error handling works:\n\n```julia\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer([])\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\n(average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n```\n\nThe function correctly handles both cases: it performs the required statistical analyses on non-empty input and returns a tuple with `nothing` values for empty input. The trend is correctly identified as `:stable` for the given data, as the temperatures fluctuate up and down.","status":200,"tokens":[263,459],"elapsed":6.43512,"cost":0.007674,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-23981,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
