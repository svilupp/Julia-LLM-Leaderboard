Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'll follow the problem-solving steps to write the `weather_data_analyzer` function.\n\n### Step 1: Think through the approach\n\nTo solve this task, we'll use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures. For the trend, we'll compare the first and last temperatures in the list. If the last temperature is higher, the trend is increasing. If it's lower, the trend is decreasing. Otherwise, the trend is stable.\n\n### Step 2: Write the necessary code\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow, let's use the `weather_data_analyzer` function to analyze the provided temperature data:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresults = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(results)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check the solution\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```julia\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nThis indicates that the average temperature is 23.4, the maximum temperature is 27, the minimum temperature is 20, and the trend is decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[259,421],"elapsed":3.665259834,"cost":0.0004854,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-611483570,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
