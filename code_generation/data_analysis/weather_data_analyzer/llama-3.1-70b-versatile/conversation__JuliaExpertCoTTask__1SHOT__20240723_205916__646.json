Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'll solve this task step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Think through the approach\n\nTo solve this task, I'll use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures. For the trend, I'll compare the first and last temperatures in the list. If the last temperature is higher than the first, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last temperature is lower than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n### Step 2: Write any functions and other code needed\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow, I'll call the `weather_data_analyzer` function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n\nThe output of the `println` statement should be:\n\n```julia\n(average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :decreasing)\n```\n\nThis result seems reasonable based on the input data.","status":200,"tokens":[259,416],"elapsed":1.984454166,"cost":0.00048145,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":793939175,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
