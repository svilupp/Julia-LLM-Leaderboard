Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend = temps[end] > temps[1] ? :increasing : temps[end] < temps[1] ? :decreasing : :stable\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntemps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as input and returns a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend.
