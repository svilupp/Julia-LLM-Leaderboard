Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;\n            average = nothing,\n            max = nothing,\n            min = nothing,\n            trend = nothing\n        )\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        mx = maximum(temps)\n        mn = minimum(temps)\n\n        if temps[1] < temps[end]\n            tr = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n            tr = :decreasing\n        else\n            tr = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (;\n            average = avg,\n            max = mx,\n            min = mn,\n            trend = tr\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package are used to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend, we simply compare the first and last elements of the list. This assumes that the trend is defined by whether the temperature has increased, decreased, or remained stable over the period.\n\nNote that this is a simple definition of trend. For a more robust definition of trend that can handle non-monotonic temperature data, you may need to use more sophisticated methods such as linear regression. \n\nYou can call this function with a list of temperature data as follows:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]\nresults = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(results)\n```\n\nThis will output the results of the statistical analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[147,339],"elapsed":5.013269,"cost":0.00035454,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1821663013,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
