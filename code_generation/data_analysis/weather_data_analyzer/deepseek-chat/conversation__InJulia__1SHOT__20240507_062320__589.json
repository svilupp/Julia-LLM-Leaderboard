[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `mean` function to calculate the average, `maximum` and `minimum` functions to calculate the highest and lowest temperature, respectively. For the `trend`, you can calculate the difference between each consecutive pair of temperatures, and then count the number of positive differences and negative differences. If the number of positive differences is significantly greater than the number of negative differences, then the trend is `:increasing`. If the number of negative differences is significantly greater than the number of positive differences, then the trend is `:decreasing`.

If the list of temperatures is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,392],"elapsed":22.652390042,"cost":0.00013020000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1917434385,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
