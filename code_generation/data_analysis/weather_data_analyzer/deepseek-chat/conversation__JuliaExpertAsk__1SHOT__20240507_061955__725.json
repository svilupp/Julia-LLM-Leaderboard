Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to the problem using the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x >= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x <= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if so. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and determines the trend based on the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is increasing; if all differences are non-positive, the trend is decreasing; otherwise, the trend is stable. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[185,298],"elapsed":17.809959667,"cost":0.00010934000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1143067367,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
