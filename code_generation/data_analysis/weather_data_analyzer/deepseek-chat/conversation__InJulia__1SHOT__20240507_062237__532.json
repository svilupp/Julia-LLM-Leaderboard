Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is the function `weather_data_analyzer` implemented in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate trend\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    if all(x -> x <= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(x -> x >= 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by looking at the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all differences are non-positive, the trend is `:decreasing`. If all differences are non-negative, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,321],"elapsed":18.972160334,"cost":0.00011032,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1467385945,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
