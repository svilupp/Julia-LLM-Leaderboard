Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    sorted_temps = sort(temps)\n    diffs = diff(sorted_temps)\n    if all(x -> x == 0, diffs)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can now use the function like this:\n\n```julia\ndata = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(data)\n```\n\nThe `result` variable will contain the named tuple with the calculated statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[278,306],"elapsed":19.643893958,"cost":0.0001246,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1983480688,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
