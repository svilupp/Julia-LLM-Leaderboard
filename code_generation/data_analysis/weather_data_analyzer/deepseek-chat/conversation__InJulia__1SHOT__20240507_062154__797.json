Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        diffs = diff(temps)\n        if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, we calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo determine the `trend`, we first check if the length of `temps` is less than 2. If it is, we set the trend to `:stable` because we don't have enough data to determine a trend.\n\nIf we have at least two data points, we calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures using the `diff` function. If all differences are positive, we set the trend to `:increasing`. If all differences are negative, we set the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, we set the trend to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[146,421],"elapsed":24.457687459,"cost":0.00013832,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":713038198,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
