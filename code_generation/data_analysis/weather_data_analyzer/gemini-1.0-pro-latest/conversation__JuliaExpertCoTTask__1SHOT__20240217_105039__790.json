If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nweather_data_analyzer(temps) = if isempty(temps)\n    (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\nelse\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    incdec = [diff(temps[_]) > 0, false] # initialize with the fact that the first value is not increasing\n    trend = if all(incdec)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(!incdec)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    (; average = avg, max = max, min = min, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,0],"elapsed":3.8503355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
