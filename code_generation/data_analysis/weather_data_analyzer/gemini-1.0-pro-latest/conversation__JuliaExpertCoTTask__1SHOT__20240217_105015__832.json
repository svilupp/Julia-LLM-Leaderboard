Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nweather_data_analyzer(temps) = (\n    average = mean(temps) <|> nothing,\n    max = maximum(temps) <|> nothing,\n    min = minimum(temps) <|> nothing,\n    trend = if length(temps) == 0\n        nothing\n    elseif length(temps) == 1\n        :stable\n    else\n        r = corr(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end])\n        if r > 0.0\n            :increasing\n        elseif r < 0.0\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n    end\n)\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,0],"elapsed":3.821605584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
