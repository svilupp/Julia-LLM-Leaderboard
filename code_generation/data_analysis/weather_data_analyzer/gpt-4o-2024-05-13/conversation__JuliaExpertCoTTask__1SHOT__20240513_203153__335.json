Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the `Statistics` package for statistical calculations.\n2. Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function.\n3. Check if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions.\n5. Determine the temperature trend by comparing elements in the list:\n    - If the list is strictly increasing, set the trend to `:increasing`.\n    - If the list is strictly decreasing, set the trend to `:decreasing`.\n    - Otherwise, set the trend to `:stable`.\n6.
