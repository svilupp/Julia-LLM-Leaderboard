Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish the specified task, we will use the `Statistics` package in Julia to compute the average, max, and min temperatures. We'll also determine the trend of the temperature data.

Otherwise, it calculates the average, max, and min temperatures. The trend is identified by evaluating the differences between consecutive elements in the `temps` list. If all these differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`, if all are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`, otherwise, it's `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[175,282],"elapsed":3.693779375,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-505120387,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
