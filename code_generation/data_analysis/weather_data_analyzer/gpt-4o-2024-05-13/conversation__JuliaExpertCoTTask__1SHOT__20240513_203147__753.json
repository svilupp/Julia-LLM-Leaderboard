Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's go through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Package:** First, the `Statistics` package needs to be imported to perform statistical calculations.\n2. **Define the Function:** We'll define `weather_data_analyzer` that accepts a list of temperature data.\n3. **Edge Case Handling:** If the provided list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. **Calculate Statistical Metrics:**\n   - Compute the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n   - Analyze the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list and check if the list is sorted in increasing or decreasing order.\n5. **Return the Results:** Package the calculated values in a named tuple and return it.\n\nLet's write the Julia function for this logic:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if issorted(temps, lt = <=)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif issorted(temps, lt = >=)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)  # Output will be (average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:stable)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Importing `Statistics`:** We need this package to use the `mean` function.\n- **Handling Empty List:** If `temps` is empty, a named tuple with `nothing` values is returned immediately.\n- **Calculating Average, Max, and Min:** We use `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n- **Analyzing Trend:**\n  - If the list is sorted in an increasing order (`issorted(temps, lt = <=)`), the trend is `:increasing`.\n  - If sorted in a decreasing order (`issorted(temps, lt = >=)`), the trend is `:decreasing`.\n  - Otherwise, it is `:stable`.\n\nThe example usage at the end demonstrates the function with the sample provided temperatures.\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)  # Output will be (average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:stable)\n```\n\nThis should solve the given task efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[254,582],"elapsed":6.37472975,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":569256994,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
