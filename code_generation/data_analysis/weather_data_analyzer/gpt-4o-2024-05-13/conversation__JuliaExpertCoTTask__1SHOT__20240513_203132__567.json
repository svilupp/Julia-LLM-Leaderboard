Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's break down our approach step-by-step:\n\n1. **Import the Required Modules**: We will use the `Statistics` module for statistical analyses.\n2. **Handle Edge Case for Empty List**: If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. **Calculate Statistical Measures**: Compute average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n4. **Determine the Temperature Trend**:\n    - If temperatures are consistently increasing, trend is `:increasing`.\n    - If temperatures are consistently decreasing, trend is `:decreasing`.\n    - Otherwise, trend is `:stable`.\n5. **Return Results**: Construct and return a named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = ifelse(all(diff(temps) .> 0), :increasing,\n                ifelse(all(diff(temps) .< 0), :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example Usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Implementation:\n- **Imports**: `using Statistics` to get access to `mean`.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: `isempty(temps)` checks if the list is empty.\n- **Statistical Measures**: Compute `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` of `temps`.\n- **Trend Calculation**: \n  - `diff(temps)` computes the difference between consecutive elements.\n  - `all(diff(temps) .> 0)` checks if all differences are positive (increasing).\n  - `all(diff(temps) .< 0)` checks if all differences are negative (decreasing).\n  - `ifelse` determines the trend based on these conditions.\n- **Returning Results**: Constructs and returns a named tuple with the results.\n\nThis should provide a comprehensive solution to the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[254,479],"elapsed":4.572562792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1903939164,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
