Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Check**: The function starts by checking if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculating Statistics**:\n    - `avg_temp`: Uses `mean` from `Statistics` to calculate the average temperature.\n    - `max_temp`: Uses `maximum` to find the highest temperature.\n    - `min_temp`: Uses `minimum` to find the lowest temperature.\n3. **Trend Detection**: \n    - Checks the differences between consecutive temperatures using `diff`.\n    - Determines the trend based on whether the differences are all positive (`:increasing`) or all negative (`:decreasing`). If neither, the trend is `:stable`.\n4. **Return**: Returns a named tuple with the calculated statistics.\n\n### Example:\nWhen running `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`, the function calculates:\n- `average` as 23.4\n- `max` as 27\n- `min` as 20\n- `trend` as `:stable` because the sequence shows no consistent increase or decrease.","status":200,"tokens":[254,420],"elapsed":4.367609333,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1778853223,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
