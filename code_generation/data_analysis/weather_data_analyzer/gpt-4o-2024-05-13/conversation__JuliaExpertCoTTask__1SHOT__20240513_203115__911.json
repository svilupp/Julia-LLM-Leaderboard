Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To perform the required task, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import required package**: I'll use the `Statistics` package for calculating the mean of temperatures.\n2. **Check for empty list**: If the input list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. **Calculate average, max, and min**: These are straightforward statistical calculations.\n4. **Determine trend**: Compare consecutive elements to determine if the overall trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Step 1**: Import the `Statistics` package.\n- **Step 2**: Check if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all components set to `nothing`.\n- **Step 3**: Calculate `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n- **Step 4**: Calculate the trend of the temperature data:\n  - If all differences between consecutive temperatures are positive, the trend is `:increasing`.\n  - If all differences are negative, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n  - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nThis function covers all specified tasks and handles edge cases like an empty list appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[254,454],"elapsed":4.180035167,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-63518000,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
