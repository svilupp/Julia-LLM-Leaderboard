Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import the necessary package**: We need the `Statistics` package to compute the average.\n2. **Define the function**: We'll create a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as input.\n3. **Check for an empty list**: If the input list is empty, we'll return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. **Compute statistical measures**: Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using appropriate functions.\n5. **Determine the trend**: Check whether the temperatures are in an increasing, decreasing order, or stable.\n6. **Return results**: Return the results in a named tuple format.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if issorted(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif issorted(temps; rev=true)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage with the provided data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Average, Max, and Min**: We use `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` from the `Statistics` package to calculate these values.\n- **Trend**: We use `issorted` to check if the data is sorted in increasing or decreasing order.\n- **Named Tuple**: The syntax `(; key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)` is used to create the named tuple for output.\n- **Empty List Handling**: If the list is empty, a named tuple with all values as `nothing` is returned. \n\nThese steps ensure that we cover all cases and return the results in the expected format.","status":200,"tokens":[254,457],"elapsed":4.881696208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":697625925,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
