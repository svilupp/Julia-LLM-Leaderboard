Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine if the input list `temps` is empty**: If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. **Calculate the average temperature**: Use the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. **Find the maximum and minimum temperatures**: Use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions, respectively.\n4. **Determine the trend**: The trend is determined as:\n    - `:increasing` if each temperature is greater than the one before.\n    - `:decreasing` if each temperature is less than the one before.\n    - `:stable` if neither of the above conditions is satisfied.\n5. **Return the results in a named tuple**.\n\nLet's write the code that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(temps[i] < temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps) - 1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] > temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps) - 1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return results in a named tuple\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis code solves the task as required:\n- It handles empty input by returning `nothing` for each field.\n- It calculates the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n- It determines the trend based on a simple comparison of consecutive elements.\n- It returns the results as a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[254,462],"elapsed":4.972799041,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-81906977,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
