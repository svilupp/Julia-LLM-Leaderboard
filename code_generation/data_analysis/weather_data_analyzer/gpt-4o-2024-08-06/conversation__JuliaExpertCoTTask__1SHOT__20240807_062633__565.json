Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the given task, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Import the necessary package**: We will use the `Statistics` package to compute the average.\n2. **Handle the edge case**: Check if the list is empty and return a named tuple with `nothing` values.\n3. **Compute statistical measures**:\n   - Calculate the `average` temperature.\n   - Find the `max` and `min` temperatures.\n4. **Determine the trend**: \n   - Compare successive elements to determine if temperatures are generally increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n5. **Return the results in a named tuple**.\n\nLet's implement this in the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Edge case: If the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistical measures\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    increasing = all(temps[i] <= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    decreasing = all(temps[i] >= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    \n    if increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the named tuple\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test with provided data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function checks if the temperature list is empty, computes statistical values, determines the trend, and encapsulates the results in a named tuple.
