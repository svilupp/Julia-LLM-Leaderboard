This function will utilize the `Statistics` package for statistical operations and determine the trend based on the temperature readings.\n \nHere is how you can implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- **Statistics Calculation**:\n  - `average=nothing` is replaced by `avg_temp`, calculated using `mean(temps)`.\n  - `max=nothing` is replaced by `max_temp`, determined by `maximum(temps)`.\n  - `min=nothing` is replaced by `min_temp`, determined by `minimum(temps)`.\n- **Trend Detection**: \n  - The `diff` function calculates the difference between each consecutive pair of temperature readings.\n  - Using `all(diff(temps) .> 0)`, we check if all differences are positive, indicating an increasing trend.\n  - Similarly, `all(diff(temps) .< 0)` checks for a decreasing trend.\n  - If neither condition is met, we assume the trend is `:stable`.\n  \nThis structure ensures clear and concise code with proper statistical analysis and trend detection for any list of daily temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[142,448],"elapsed":5.740647,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-78014051,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
