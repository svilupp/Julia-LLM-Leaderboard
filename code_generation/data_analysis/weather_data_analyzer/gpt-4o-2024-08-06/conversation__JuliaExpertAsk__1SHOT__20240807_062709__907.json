Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To analyze the temperature data as specified, we can utilize the `Statistics` package in Julia for computing the mean, and basic functions for finding the minimum and maximum values. The function will also determine the trend based on the comparison of the first and last elements of the list. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks if the list is empty, returning `nothing` for all fields if so. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list.","status":200,"tokens":[175,243],"elapsed":2.899968125,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1140597497,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
