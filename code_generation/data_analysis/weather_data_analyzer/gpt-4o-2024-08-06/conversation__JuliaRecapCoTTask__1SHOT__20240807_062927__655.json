[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll utilize the `Statistics` package in Julia for some simple data analysis on temperature data, and return the results in a named tuple. The main requirements are to calculate the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and determine the trend of the data series. If the list is empty, the return values should be set to `nothing`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Import Required Package**: We'll use the `Statistics` package for the `mean` function.\n2. **Calculate Average**: Use `mean` from the `Statistics` package.\n3. **Calculate Maximum and Minimum**: Use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions.\n4. **Determine Trend**: \n   - \"Increasing\" if each element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous one.\n   - \"Decreasing\" if each element in the list is lesser than or equal to the previous one.\n   - \"Stable\" if neither increasing nor decreasing.\n5. **Handle Empty List**: If the input list is empty, return a named tuple with all entries set to `nothing`.\n6. **Return the Results**: Create and return a named tuple with the results.\n\nLet's implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    is_increasing = all(temps[i] <= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    is_decreasing = all(temps[i] >= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    \n    if is_increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- We use `isempty` to check if the temperature array is empty.\n- `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions are employed for statistical calculations.\n- The trend is determined by comparing each pair of consecutive elements in the list.\n\nThis implementation should cover the task requirements and provide the necessary outputs efficiently.
