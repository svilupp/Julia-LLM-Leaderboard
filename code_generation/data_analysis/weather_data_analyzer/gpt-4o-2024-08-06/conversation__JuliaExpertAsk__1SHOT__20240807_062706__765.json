Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia to perform statistical analysis on the temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n            :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum of the temperatures. The `trend` is determined by checking if all differences between subsequent temperatures are positive, negative, or neither, thus categorizing the trend as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. If the temperature list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[175,255],"elapsed":2.836244625,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1197014973,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
