Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you need to perform statistical analyses on a list of temperature data using Julia's `Statistics` package. Here's how you can implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list `temps` is empty and immediately returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if true. Otherwise, it calculates the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. The `trend` is determined by checking if the temperature differences between consecutive days are all positive, all negative, or otherwise. Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[175,266],"elapsed":3.211513709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":109072543,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
