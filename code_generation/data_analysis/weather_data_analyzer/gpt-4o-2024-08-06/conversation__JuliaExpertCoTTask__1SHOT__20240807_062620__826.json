Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we need to calculate statistics on the given list of temperatures: average, maximum, and minimum values. Additionally, we need to determine the trend of the temperature changes. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the Statistics:**\n   - Use the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package to find the average temperature.\n   - Use the built-in `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find the max and min temperatures.\n\n2. **Determine the Trend:**\n   - Calculate the differences between consecutive elements.\n   - Check if these differences are consistently positive (indicating an `:increasing` trend), consistently negative (`:decreasing` trend), or a mix of both (`:stable` trend).\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n   - If the list is empty, return a tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n4. **Construct a Named Tuple:**\n   - Construct the result using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate trend\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    \n    if all(diffs .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diffs .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's break down this code:\n\n- We first check if the `temps` list is empty. If so, we return a named tuple with `nothing` for all fields.\n- We calculate the average, maximum, and minimum using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`, respectively.\n- We determine the trend by checking the sign of the differences between consecutive elements.\n- Finally, the result is returned as a named tuple. \n\nWhen you test the function with the data `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, it will output the corresponding statistical values and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[254,520],"elapsed":5.342660709,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-726267913,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
