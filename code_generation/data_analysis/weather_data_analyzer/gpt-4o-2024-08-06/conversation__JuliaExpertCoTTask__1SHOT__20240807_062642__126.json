Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Let's start by importing the necessary package and creating the function.\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Let's use the given data to test the function\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n\n# Check for edge cases like an empty list\nempty_result = weather_data_analyzer([])\nprintln(empty_result)\n```\n\n- I first checked if the list is empty and returned a named tuple with `nothing` values in that case.\n- I used `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` to calculate the statistical values.\n- The `diff` function was used to determine the trend by checking if differences between consecutive elements are consistently positive, negative, or mixed.\n- A named tuple was returned with the calculated statistics. \n\nBy this implementation, the function produces the expected output for both the provided data and an empty list.","status":200,"tokens":[254,349],"elapsed":3.837327292,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":370550272,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
