Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `weather_data_analyzer` function, we'll follow the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Check for Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, return a named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n\n2. **Calculate Statistical Measures**:\n    - Calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n    - Find the maximum temperature using the `maximum` function.\n    - Find the minimum temperature using the `minimum` function.\n\n3. **Determine the Trend**:\n    - If temperatures are strictly increasing, set the trend as `:increasing`.\n    - If temperatures are strictly decreasing, set the trend as `:decreasing`.\n    - Otherwise, set the trend as `:stable`.\n\n4. **Return Results**: Return the results in a named tuple.\n\nLet's implement this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    # Check for empty input\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average, max, and min\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    if issorted(temps, rev=false) && length(temps) > 1 && temps[1] != temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif issorted(temps, rev=true) && length(temps) > 1 && temps[1] != temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- We first check if the input `temps` is empty, returning a tuple with `nothing` for all values.\n- We use `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` to find the relevant stats.\n- We determine the trend by checking if the list is sorted in increasing or decreasing order using `issorted`. We ensure it is not the same value throughout by checking the ends.\n- The final output is returned as a named tuple as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[254,500],"elapsed":6.732946209,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1204496146,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
