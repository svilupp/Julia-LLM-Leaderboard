It sorts the events by their start times and then checks for any overlapping events using a loop. If any conflicts are found, it creates a dictionary to store the conflicting events. Finally, based on whether conflicts were found or not, the function returns either \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict with details\".","status":200,"tokens":[137,311],"elapsed":3.776153929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
