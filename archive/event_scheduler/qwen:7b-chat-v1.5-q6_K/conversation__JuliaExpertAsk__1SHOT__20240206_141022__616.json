It first checks for empty events list and returns appropriate message. Then it iterates through each event, checking for overlap with subsequent events. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found throughout all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,196],"elapsed":2.335192851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
