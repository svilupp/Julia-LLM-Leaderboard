If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n\nIf there are events, the function iterates through each event and checks for any overlapping events by comparing their start and finish times.\n\nAny overlapping events are stored in a dictionary where the key is the starting time of the conflict and the value is the finishing time.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the dictionary of conflicts is empty. If it is, that means there were no scheduling conflicts, so it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf there are conflicts, the function constructs a string with the conflict times and returns it along with the message \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":4.069719371,"_type":"aimessage"}]
