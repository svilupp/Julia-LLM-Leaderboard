It uses the `Dates` package for parsing dates from strings.\n\nThe function first handles the case where there are no events by returning \"No events\". Then, it iterates through each event checking for overlapping events with future start times.\n\nIf any conflicts are found, they are stored in a dictionary along with the conflict message. If no conflicts are detected, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nFinally, if the dictionary of conflicts is not empty, the function constructs and returns a conflict message including all detected conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":3.776347605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
