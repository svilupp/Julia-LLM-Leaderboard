It uses the `Dates` package to parse datetime strings.\n\nThe `overlap` function is used to check if two events overlap in time. If there are any overlapping events, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflict\".\n\nThe main `event_scheduler` function iterates through the list of events, checks for overlaps using the `overlap` function, and stores the results. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are conflicts, it throws an exception with a message indicating the issue.","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":6.013837932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
