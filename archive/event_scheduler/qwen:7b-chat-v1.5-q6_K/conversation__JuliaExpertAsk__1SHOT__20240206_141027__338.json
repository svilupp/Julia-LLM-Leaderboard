Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary packages: `Dates` for handling dates and times.\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function that takes a list of event tuples as input.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the event start and finish times as keys.\n4. Iterate through the given events and add each event's start and finish times to the dictionary.\n5. Check if any overlapping events exist by iterating through the dictionary and comparing key pairs.\n6. If there are no conflicts, return \"No conflicts\". If there is a conflict, return \"Conflict\".\n7. If the input list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nHere's the complete code implementing the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    event_dict = Dict{Tuple{Date, Time}, Tuple{Date, Time}}}\n    \n    for event in events\n        start_time = Date(event[1][1]], event[1][2]])\n        end_time   = Date(event[2][1]], event[2][2]])\n\n        event_dict[start_time, end_time] = (event[1], event[2]]), nothing\n    end\n    \n    overlapping_events = []\n    \n    for time_range in event_dict.values()\n        if !isempty(time_range) && start_time <- end_time\n            overlapping_events.append(time_range)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if isempty(overlapping_events))\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 10:30\"), (\"2023-01-01 11:00\", \"2023-01-01 13:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)))\n```\n\nThis code should provide the expected output based on the provided events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":5.25586858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
