Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    start_times = [event[1]...] for event in events]\n    finish_times = [event[2]...] for event in events]\n\n    overlapping_events = Dict()\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times))\n        for j in i+1:length(start_times)\n            if overlap(start_times[i], finish_times[i]), start_times[j], finish_times[j])\n                overlapping_events[(i, j))] = true\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if isempty(overlapping_events)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(2022-01-01), (2022-01-02)), (2022-01-03))]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)))  # Output: Conflict\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if the list of events is empty.

If the `overlapping_events` dictionary is empty, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\" along with a list of conflicting pairs (in this example, just one pair is shown)).","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":4.525903312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
