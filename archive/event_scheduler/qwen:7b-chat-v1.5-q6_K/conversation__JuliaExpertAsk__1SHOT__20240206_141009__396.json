If it's, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThen, it iterates through each event and compares its start and finish times with the existing conflicts in the `conflicts` dictionary.\n\nIf a conflict is found, it adds an entry to the `conflicts` dictionary indicating the conflict.\n\nFinally, the function checks if there are any conflicts. If not, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns a string listing the conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":3.790656006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
