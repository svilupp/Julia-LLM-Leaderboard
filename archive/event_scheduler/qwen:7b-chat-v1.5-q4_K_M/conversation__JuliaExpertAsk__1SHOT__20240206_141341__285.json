It first sorts the events by their start time. Then it checks for any overlapping events by comparing the start times of consecutive events. If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If at least one overlap is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". If the input list is empty, it also returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.370540658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
