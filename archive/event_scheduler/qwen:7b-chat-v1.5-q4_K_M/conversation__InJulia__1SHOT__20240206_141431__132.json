If it is, it returns \"No events\". Then, it parses the start and finish times of each event as `EventTime` objects with a `date` field. Next, it compares these event times to find any overlapping intervals. If it finds any conflicts, it appends a conflict message to a list. Finally, if no conflicts were found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":3.880558156,"_type":"aimessage"}]
