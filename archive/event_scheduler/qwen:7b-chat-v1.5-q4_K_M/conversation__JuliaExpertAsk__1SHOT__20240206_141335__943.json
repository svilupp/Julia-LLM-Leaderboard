Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    conflicts = Dict()\n\n    for (i, (start, finish))) in enumerate(events)\n        start_date = DateTime(start)\n        finish_date = DateTime(finish)\n\n        # Check for overlapping events\n        for conflict_event in conflicts[start_date:finish_date]]\n            if isequal(conflict_event[1]], i) && overlap(conflict_event[2], start, finish))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n\n        conflicts[start_date:finish_date]] = [i]\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 14:00\", \"2023-01-01 16:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: No conflicts\n```\nThis function `event_scheduler` checks for scheduling conflicts between events by comparing their start and finish times.
