Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    event_dict = Dict{Tuple{Date, Date}, String}, ()...)\n\n    conflicts = filter!(event -> findfirst(x -> x.start <= event[1] && event[1] <= x.finish, event_dict)) !== nothing, events)\n\nif isempty(conflicts)\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nelse\n    return \"Conflict\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events in the format tuples with start and finish dates. It uses the `Dates` package for parsing the dates.\n\nThe function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n\nIf there are events, the function converts each event tuple into a dictionary with the event details (start and finish date). This allows easy checking for conflicts later.\n\nNext, the function filters out any overlapping events by searching for similar events in the dictionary. Events are considered overlapping if their start dates overlap or their finish dates overlap.\n\nIf there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIf there are overlapping events, the function returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.563811662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
