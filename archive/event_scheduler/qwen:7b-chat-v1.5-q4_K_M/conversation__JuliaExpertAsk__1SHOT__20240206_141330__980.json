The function uses the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times. It then compares each event's duration with the intervals between other events to identify overlapping time periods. Finally, the function returns either \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\" based on the presence of scheduling conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[137,278],"elapsed":2.932216265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
