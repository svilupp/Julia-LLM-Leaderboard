Define a function called `event_scheduler`.\n3. Check if the list of events is empty. If so, return \"No events\".\n4. Convert the start and finish times of each event to a `DateTime` format using the `Date` function and the `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M` format string.\n5. Iterate through each event and compare its start and end times with the start and end times of all subsequent events.\n6. If any overlapping events are found, return \"Conflict\".\n7. After checking all possible pairs of events, if no conflicts were found, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's the Julia code for the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    datetime_events = map(event -> (\n        start_time = Date(\"$(event[1]) $(event[2][1:5]))\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n        finish_time = Date(\"$(event[1]) $(event[2][6:end]))\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n    ), events)\n    \n    conflicts_found = false\n    for i in 1:(length(datetime_events) - 1))\n        event_i = datetime_events[i]\n        for j in (i + 1):length(datetime_events)\n            event_j = datetime_events[j]\n            \n            if (event_i.finish_time > event_j.start_time) &&\n                (event_i.finish_time < event_j.finish_time)\n                \n                conflicts_found = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n        \n        if conflicts_found\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflicts_found ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-01-01\", \"09:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01\", \"14:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01\", \"16:00\")\n]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)  # Output: Conflict\n```\n\nIn the example above, we define three events on January 1st, 2023.
