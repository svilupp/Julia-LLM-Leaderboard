Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The function first parses the input events into proper Date objects, and then checks for overlapping intervals using the `isoverlapping` function on ranges. If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe provided test case is run at the end to verify that the function works correctly in handling scheduling conflicts among events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":20.563841136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
