Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_date_time(date_string)\n    return DateTime(date_string, \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"))\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        previous_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        \n        if current_event[1] < previous_event[2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if the list of events is empty.

Otherwise, after checking all pairs, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":12.588391774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
