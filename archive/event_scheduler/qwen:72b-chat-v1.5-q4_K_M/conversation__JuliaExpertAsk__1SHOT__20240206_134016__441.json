Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> Date(x[1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if Date(sorted_events[i-1][2]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") < Date(sorted_events[i][1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` first checks if the event list is empty.

If the end time of a previous event is less than the start time of the current event, there's no overlap and the loop continues. If an overlapping event is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":14.380904545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
