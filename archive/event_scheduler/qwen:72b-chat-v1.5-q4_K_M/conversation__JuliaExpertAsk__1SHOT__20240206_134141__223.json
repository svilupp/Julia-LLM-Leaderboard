Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If there's at least one conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if there are no conflicting events or the list is empty, it returns \"No conflicts\" or \"No events\", respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":15.132958817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
