Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Each event is a tuple with start and finish times in the given format.\n\nFirst, the function checks if there are any events in the list. If not, it returns \"No events\".\n\nNext, the events are sorted by their start time using the `sort!` function.\n\nThe function then iterates over the sorted events. For each event, it compares its start time with the end time of the previous event. If the current event starts before the previous one ends, there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe example provided in the task is executed at the end of the code to show that it correctly identifies a scheduling conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":22.100655448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
