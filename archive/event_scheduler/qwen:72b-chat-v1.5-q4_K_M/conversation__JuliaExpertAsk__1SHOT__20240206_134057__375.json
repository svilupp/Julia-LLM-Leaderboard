Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> Date(x[1]), \"YYYY-MM-DD\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if Date(sorted_events[i][1]), \"YYYY-MM-DD\") < Date(sorted_events[i-1][2]], \"YYYY-MM-DD\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` first checks if the event list is empty. If it is, the function returns \"No events\". \n\nNext, the function sorts the events based on their start dates.\n\nThen, the function iterates through the sorted events starting from the second event. For each pair of consecutive events, the function checks if the start date of the current event (second in the pair) is earlier than the end date of the previous event (first in the pair). If this condition is met, it means there's a scheduling conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":14.273110703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
