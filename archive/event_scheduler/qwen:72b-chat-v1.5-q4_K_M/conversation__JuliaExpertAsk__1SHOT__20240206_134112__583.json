Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_event(event)\n    start_time = Date(string(event[1])), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish_time = Date(string(event[2])), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    return (start_time, finish_time)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(map(parse_event, events)), by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events as input. It first parses the event tuples into start and finish dates using the `parse_event` helper function.\n\nThe parsed events are then sorted by their start times. The function iterates over the sorted events, comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If any overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned immediately.\n\nIf no conflicts are detected after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":15.140826828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
