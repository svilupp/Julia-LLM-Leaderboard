Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> Date(x[1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        previous_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        \n        if Date(current_event[1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") < Date(previous_event[2]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, I first check if the events list is empty. If so, it returns \"No events\". \n\nNext, the events are sorted by their start time using `sort!`. \n\nThen, a loop iterates over all pairs of consecutive events. For each pair, the start time of the current event is compared with the end time of the previous event. If the current event starts before the previous one ends, it indicates a scheduling conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf the loop completes without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":14.443411993,"_type":"aimessage"}]
