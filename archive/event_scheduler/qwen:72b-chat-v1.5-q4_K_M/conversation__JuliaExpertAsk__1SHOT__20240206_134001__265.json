Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_event(event)\n    start_time = Date(string(event[1])))\n    finish_time = Date(string(event[2])))\n    (start_time, finish_time)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events; by=parse_event))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        event1 = parse_event(sorted_events[i-1])\n        event2 = parse_event(sorted_events[i])\n\n        if event1[2] > event2[1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function `event_scheduler` first checks if the events list is empty.
