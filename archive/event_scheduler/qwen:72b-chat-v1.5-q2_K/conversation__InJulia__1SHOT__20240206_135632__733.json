Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of event tuples as input.\n2. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return \"No events\".\n3. Iterate over the list and compare each event's start and finish times with the other events.\n4. If any event overlaps with another event, return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's an implementation of `event_scheduler` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_i, finish_i = map(Dates.DateTime, events[i]))\n            start_j, finish_j = map(Dates.DateTime, events[j]))\n\n            if isoverlapping(start_i, finish_i, start_j, finish_j))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction isoverlapping(start1, finish1, start2, finish2)\n    return (start1 <= start2 && start2 < finish1) ||\n           (start1 <= finish2 && finish2 > start1)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this code with example events to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":12.717618037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
