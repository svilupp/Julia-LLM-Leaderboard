[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If the list is empty.\n2. If there are no overlapping events.\n3. If there are any events that overlap in time.\n\nHere's how I would implement this in Julia using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1))\n        event_i, event_j = events[i], events[i+1]\n        \n        if is_before(event_j[1], event_i[2])) && !is_simultaneous(event_i[1], event_j[2]))\n            conflicts = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflicts ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nNow, you can use the `event_scheduler` function to check for scheduling conflicts in a list of events.\n\nRemember, this implementation assumes that the input is already in the correct format (tuples with DateTimes).
