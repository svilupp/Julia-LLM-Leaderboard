[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It involves checking for scheduling conflicts among a list of events. I understand that we should use the Julia `Dates` package to parse the date and time strings.\n\nHere's how I will approach this problem:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function called `event_scheduler` which takes a list of event tuples as its argument.\n2. **Parse Dates**: Use the `Dates` package to parse the start and finish times into proper `Date` objects.\n3. **Check Conflicts**: Loop through each event in the list, comparing its end time with the start time of the next event (if any). If there's an overlap, return \"Conflict\".\n4. **No Conflicts or Events**: If no conflicts are found and the list is not empty, return \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on my approach.","status":200,"tokens":[0,197],"elapsed":8.916545068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
