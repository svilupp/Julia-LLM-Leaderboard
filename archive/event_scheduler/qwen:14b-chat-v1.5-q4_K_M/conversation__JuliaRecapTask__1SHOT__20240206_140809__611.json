[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Import the necessary package: `Dates`.\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function that takes a list of event tuples as input.\n3. Check if the input list is empty and return \"No events\" if true.\n4. Iterate through each event tuple in the list.\n5. For each event, create two `DateTime` objects using the start and finish times provided.\n6. Compare the `DateTime` objects to check for any overlaps between events.\n7. If there are no overlapping events, continue to the next iteration.\n8. If an overlap is found, return \"Conflict\".\n9. After iterating through all events, if there were no conflicts, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (start_time, finish_time) in events\n        start_date = parse_date_string(start_time)\n        finish_date = parse_date_string(finish_time)\n\n        if start_date <= finish_date\n            # Check overlapping events by comparing their dates\n            for (i, (inner_start, inner_finish)) in enumerate(events))\n                if i != j && start_date >= inner_start && finish_date <= inner_finish\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n                end\n            end\n        else\n            error(\"Invalid event time: $start_time)\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis implementation should solve the task as described.
