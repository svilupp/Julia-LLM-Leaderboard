[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case.\n\nThe function then iterates through the list of events, comparing each event with its subsequent ones to check for overlapping time periods.\n\nIf a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are detected after iterating through all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nAdditionally, there's a `parse_date_time` helper function that parses a date and time string into separate Date and Time objects. This function is used within the main `event_scheduler` function to handle the event tuples' start and finish times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":4.859308315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
