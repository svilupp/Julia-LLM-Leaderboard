Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = parse_date_times(events[i])\n        start2, finish2 = parse_date_times(events[i+1]))\n\n        if start1 ≤ finish2 && start2 ≤ finish1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Helper function to parse date-time tuples\nfunction parse_date_times(event)\n    start_time, finish_time = event\n    start_date, start_hour = split(start_time, ' ')\n    start_year, start_month = split(start_date, '-')\n\n    finish_date, finish_hour = split(finish_time, ' ')\n    finish_year, finish_month = split(finish_date, '-')\n\n    return (Dates.DateTime(start_year, Month[parse(\"month\", start_month))], start_hour, 0), \n             Dates.DateTime(finish_year, Month[parse(\"month\", finish_month))]), finish_hour, 0)\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of event tuples and checks for scheduling conflicts. The helper function `parse_date_times` is used to convert the start and end time strings into `DateTime` objects.\n\nTo test this function, you can call it with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the result of the event scheduler function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,386],"elapsed":6.151191433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
