Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1]))))\n\n    has_conflict = false\n    prev_end_time = nothing\n\n    for (start_time, _) in sorted_events\n        if prev_end_time !== nothing && start_time <= prev_end_time\n            has_conflict = true\n            break\n        end\n\n        prev_end_time = start_time + Dates.Hour(1) # Assuming events last 1 hour\n    end\n\n    if has_conflict\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the events by their start times. Then it iterates through the sorted events, checking for overlapping events. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":3.243804122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
