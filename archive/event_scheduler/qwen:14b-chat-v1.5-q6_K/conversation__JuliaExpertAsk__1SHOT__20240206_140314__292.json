Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function using Julia and the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (i, (start, finish)) ) in enumerate(events, 1)\n        for j in i:length(events)\n            if events[j][1] <= finish && events[j][2] >= start\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the event list and checks for any overlapping time periods between events.
