Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time.\nThe function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns \"No events\".\nNext, the function loops through each event tuple in the list. For each event tuple, the function calculates the end time of the previous event tuple (if there was one) and then adds the start and end times of the current event tuple to create a new event tuple.\nAfter looping through all the event tuples, the function checks if any two event tuples overlap in time. If two or more event tuples overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\nThe function `event_scheduler` is a powerful tool for scheduling events and checking for scheduling conflicts among the events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.815017696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
