Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Start, Finish}})))\n    # Check if events list is empty\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort events by start time\n    events_sorted_by_start_time = sort(events, by: :start))\n    \n    # Initialize variables for calculating conflicts\n    overlapping_events = false\n    event_conflicts = false\n    \n    # Check if there are any overlapping events in the sorted list\n    for (i, e)) in enumerate(events_sorted_by_start_time))\n        if Dates.Date(e.Start) <= Dates.Date(e.Finish))\n            overlapping_events = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate event conflicts\n    event_conflicts = false\n    for (i, e1)) in enumerate(events_sorted_by_start_time))\n    for (j, e2)) in enumerate(events_sorted_by_start_time))\n        if Dates.Date(e1.Start) <= Dates.Date(e1.Finish))))\n            if Dates.Date(e2.Start) <= Dates.Date(e2.Finish))))\n                event_conflicts = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Check for any conflicts among events\n    if overlapping_events || event_conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\n    \n    # Return \"No conflicts\" if there are no conflicting events\n    if !overlapping_events && !event_conflicts\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply pass in a vector of tuples representing events. The function will then return either \"No conflicts\", \"Conflict\", or \"No events\" depending on whether there are any overlapping events, event conflicts, or no events at all.\nI hope this helps!
