If there is an overlap, the function sets a boolean value `conflicts` to true.\n\nAfter checking all events in the list, the function returns `conflicts` to true if there are any overlapping events in the list or returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":3.843691811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
