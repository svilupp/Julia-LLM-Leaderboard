Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    events = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n        start_times = events[:, 1]]\n        finish_times = events[:, 2]])\n        \n        overlap_events = []\n        \n        for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n            if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n                overlap_events.append(i)\n                \n        \n        return overlap_events\n        \n    end\nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events\n        \nend\n\nevents = event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) do\n    overlap_events = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(start_times) - 1:\n        if (start_times[i] ] .union(finish_times[i]]) .size() > 0:\n            overlap_events.append(i)\n            \n        \n    return overlap_events","status":200,"tokens":[0,1617],"elapsed":15.968676953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
