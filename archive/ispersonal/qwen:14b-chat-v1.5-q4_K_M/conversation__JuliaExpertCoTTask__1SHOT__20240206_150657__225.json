All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, the `ispersonal` function for `Car` returns `true`, as specified in the task.\n\nWhen you call `ispersonal(Car())`, it will return `true` because we are using the `Car` type, which has a `true` value for `ispersonal`.\nassistantIf you need further assistance or examples, please let me know.
