The function `ispersonal` takes a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns `true` if it's a personal vehicle (`Car` or `Motorcycle`) and `false` otherwise. The example demonstrates the usage of the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":12.344458242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
