The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Five mutable structs are created as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n\nThe function `ispersonal` takes a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as input (through its `Type`). It checks if the input type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `ispersonal` function with each vehicle type and prints the results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":14.279381662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
