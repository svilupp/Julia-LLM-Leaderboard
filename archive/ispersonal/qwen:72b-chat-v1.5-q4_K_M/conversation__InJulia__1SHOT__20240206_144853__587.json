The function `ispersonal` takes a `Type{<:AbstractVehicle}}` as input and returns `true` if the vehicle is a personal vehicle (`Car` or `Motorcycle`) and `false` otherwise. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":12.308402098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
