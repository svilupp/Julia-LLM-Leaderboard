We then implement the function `ispersonal`, which checks the type of the input vehicle and returns `true` for personal vehicles (Cars and Motorcycles) and `false` for commercial or public transport vehicles (Buses and Trucks). The code also includes an example of using the `ispersonal` function with a Car object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":12.863419474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
