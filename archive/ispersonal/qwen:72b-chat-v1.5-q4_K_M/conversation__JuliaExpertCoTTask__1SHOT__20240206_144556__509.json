The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle type is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, returning true in those cases. For `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns false. The example demonstrates how to use the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":12.823020579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
