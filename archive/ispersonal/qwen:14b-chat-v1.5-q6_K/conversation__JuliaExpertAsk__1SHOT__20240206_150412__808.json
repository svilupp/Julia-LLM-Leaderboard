All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution that implements the `ispersonal` function as described:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nmutable struct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Additional fields specific to a car\nend\n\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Additional fields specific to a motorcycle\nend\n\n# ...

The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different types of vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":4.353809792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
