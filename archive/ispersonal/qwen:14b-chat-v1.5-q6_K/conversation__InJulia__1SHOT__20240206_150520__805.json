All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

These types have an `ispersonal` field set to `true` by default.\n\nThe `Bus` and `Truck` types are defined with an `ispersonal` field set to `false`.\n\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a `AbstractVehicle` instance and returns the value of its `ispersonal` field.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":4.571028834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
