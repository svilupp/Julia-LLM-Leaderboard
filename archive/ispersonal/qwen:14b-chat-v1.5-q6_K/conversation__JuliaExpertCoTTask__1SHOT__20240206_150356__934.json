All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This function should take an array of integers as input, find all the odd numbers in that array, and return them as a new array. The function should handle both positive and negative integers.\nFor example, if you call `get_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, -4, -5, 6]))`, the expected output is `[1, 3, -5]`.\nHere's some starter code to help you get started:\n```julia\nfunction get_odd_numbers(arr::Array{Int, 1}})\n    # Your code here\nend\n```\n# Data\n```julia\nget_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, -4, -5, 6]))\n```\n0\nassistant번역결과  \n# 데이터\n```julia\nget_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, -4, -5, 6]))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":7.773117545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
