All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# First, let's define an abstract type for vehicles.\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Now, we'll create concrete types for each vehicle category.\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Add any additional properties or methods if needed.\nend\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Add any additional properties or methods if needed.\nend\n\n# For buses and trucks, we can define them similarly.\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Add any additional properties or methods if needed.\nend\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    # Add any additional properties or methods if needed.\nend\n\n# Now, let's define the ispersonal function.\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_car = Car()\nmy_motorcycle = Motorcycle()\nmy_bus = Bus()\nmy_truck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(my_car)))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(my_motorcycle)))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(my_bus)))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(my_truck)))  # Output: false\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function checks if a given `AbstractVehicle` is a car or motorcycle and returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":6.024149493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
