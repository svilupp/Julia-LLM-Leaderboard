All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Car and Motorcycle types have an expected `drive_for Everyday` method, hence they return True. Bus and Truck types do not match these conditions, so they return False. The default behavior for other AbstractVehicle subtypes is also False.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":2.097556413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
