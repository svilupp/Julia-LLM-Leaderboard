The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it's either of these two, it returns `true`. For Bus and Truck, it returns `false`, as per the task requirements. For any other type not covered by the examples, it assumes `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":2.109529012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
