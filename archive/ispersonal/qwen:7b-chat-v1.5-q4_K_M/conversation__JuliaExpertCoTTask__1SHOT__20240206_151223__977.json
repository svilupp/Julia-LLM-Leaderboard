All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

This ensures that any concrete classes derived from `AbstractVehicle` will need to implement the `drive()` method.\n\nNext, we define the function `ispersonal`, which takes a `AbstractVehicle` instance as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a personal vehicle or not. The function uses conditional checks on the provided class to make its decision. If no match is found, the function returns the default value of `False`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":2.794811523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
