All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It uses type checking to determine the correct behavior for each subtype.\n\nThe example usage shows that the function correctly identifies Cars and Motorcycles as personal vehicles, while it returns false for Buses and true with the default value (true) for Trucks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.289408509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
