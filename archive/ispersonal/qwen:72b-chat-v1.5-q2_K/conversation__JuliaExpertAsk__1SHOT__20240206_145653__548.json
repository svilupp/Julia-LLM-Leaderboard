The `ispersonal` function is defined to return `true` for personal vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) and `false` for non-personal vehicles (Bus and Truck). If any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is passed, the function returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":10.502859977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
