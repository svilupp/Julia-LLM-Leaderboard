All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function correctly returns `true` for personal vehicles (Car and Motorcycle) and `false` for non-personal vehicles (Bus and Truck).","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":11.221205285,"_type":"aimessage"}]
