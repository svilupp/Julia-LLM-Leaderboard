All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For non-personal vehicles (Bus and Truck), it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[97,205],"elapsed":9.371829484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
