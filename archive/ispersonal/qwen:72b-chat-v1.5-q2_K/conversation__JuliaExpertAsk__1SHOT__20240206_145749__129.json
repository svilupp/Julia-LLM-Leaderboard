The `ispersonal` function is defined to check if a given vehicle type is a personal vehicle. It returns true for Car and Motorcycle types and false for Bus and Truck types. An example usage of the `ispersonal` function is provided at the end of the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":9.962038991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
