All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nmutable struct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nmutable struct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where T <: AbstractVehicle\n    if T === Car || T === Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T === Bus || T === Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's provide an example:\n\n```julia\n# Create some sample vehicles\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\n# Check if they are personal vehicles\nprintln(ispersonal(car))   # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))   # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))   # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))   # Output: false\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how the `ispersonal` function works with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":9.843026888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
