All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then create specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`, which are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a vehicle object as input and checks if it is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If the input type is one of these two, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":7.647026232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
