All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `PersonalVe hicles` tuple contains the specific personal vehicle types (Car and Motorcycle).\n\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a `vehicle` as input, checks if it's a subtype of the personal vehicles, and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.\n\nIn the example usage, `ispersonal(Car())` correctly returns `true`, while `ispersonal(Bus())` returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":2.571645232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
