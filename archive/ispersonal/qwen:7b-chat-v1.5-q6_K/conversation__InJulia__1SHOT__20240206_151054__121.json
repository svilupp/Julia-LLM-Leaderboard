All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function checks if a given vehicle type has the trait and returns the appropriate result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":3.92663567,"_type":"aimessage"}]
