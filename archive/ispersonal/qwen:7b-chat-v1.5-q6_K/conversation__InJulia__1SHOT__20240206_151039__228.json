The function `ispersonal.vehicle_type` checks if the provided vehicle type belongs to the `Personal Vehicles` union.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that the function correctly identifies personal vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`) and returns `true`, while returning `false` for non-personal vehicles like buses and trucks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":2.538286063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
