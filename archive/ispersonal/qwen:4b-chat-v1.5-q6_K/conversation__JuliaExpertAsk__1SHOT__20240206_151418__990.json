All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

First, we define the abstract `Vehicle` type, which serves as a base class for all vehicle types that will be defined later.\n\n2. Next, we define the trait `PersonalVehicle` that represents a personal vehicle. This trait is based on an `if` statement that checks if the provided `Vehicle` type is a personal vehicle by checking if it has a string value for its `type` field and a string value for its `用途` field). If the check passes, then the `PersonalVehicle` trait is returned as `true`. Otherwise, `false` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.8131007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
