[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please provide a DateTime.\")\n    end\n\n    # Adding bump hours to the DateTime\n    bumped_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n\n    return bumped_dt\nend\n```\n\nThis function checks whether the input `dt` is a DateTime or a Date type. If it's a Date, an error is thrown.\n\nIf the input is valid, the function adds `bump` hours (defaulting to 3) to the DateTime using the `Hours` constructor from the Julia standard library.\n\nFinally, the bumped DateTime is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":2.561613412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
