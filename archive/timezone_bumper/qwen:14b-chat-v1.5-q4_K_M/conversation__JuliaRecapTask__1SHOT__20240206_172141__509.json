[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This function will take two arguments: `dt`, which is a DateTime type, and `bump`, which is an optional integer representing the number of hours to bump (defaulting to +3).\n\nHere's the implementation for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```julia\nimport DateTime\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime))\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n\n    return dt + hours(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `dt` is indeed of the DateTime type. If not, it throws an error.\n\nIf the input is valid, the function adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp and returns the bumped datetime.\n\nYou can test this function with various inputs to ensure its correctness and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":3.014210905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
