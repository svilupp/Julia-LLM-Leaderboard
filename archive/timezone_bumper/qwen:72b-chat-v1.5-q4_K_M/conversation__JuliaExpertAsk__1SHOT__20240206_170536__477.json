If not, it then checks if `dt` is a subtype of `DateTime`. If this condition is met, the timestamp is incremented by `bump` hours using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\nIf neither of the conditions is fulfilled, an error with an appropriate message is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":10.072466167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
