The function returns a new `DateTime` object representing the original time plus `bump` hours.\n\nThe provided data is then used to call the function and store the result in the `result` variable. Finally, the result is printed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":9.083085125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
