[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

The `timezone_bumper` function takes a DateTime object and an optional integer for the number of hours to bump. It then returns a new DateTime object with the adjusted time.\n\nIf a Date type is passed instead of a DateTime, the `invalid_type_error` function is called, which throws an ArgumentError with a specific error message.\n\nThe provided data is used to call the `timezone_bumper` function and print the resulting DateTime. Additionally, a test case with a Date type input is included to demonstrate how the error-handling mechanism works.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":15.06241746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
