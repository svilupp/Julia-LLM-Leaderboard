It also includes a helper function `invalid_type_error` to throw an error when a `Date` object is passed.\n\nThe code includes a test function `test_timezone_bumper`, which ensures that the `timezone_bumper` function works correctly and throws the expected error for `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":15.756765588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
