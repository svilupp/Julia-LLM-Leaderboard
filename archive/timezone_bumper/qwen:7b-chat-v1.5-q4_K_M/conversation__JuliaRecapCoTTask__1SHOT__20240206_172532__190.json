[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) !== \"DateTime\"\n        throw ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime.\")\n    end\n\n    new_dt = dt + TimeSpan(hours=bump))\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `timezone_bumper` function takes two parameters: `dt`, which is the input DateTime, and `bump`, which is an optional integer to increase the time by.\n2. The first line checks if the input type is a `DateTime`. If it's not, an `ArgumentError` is thrown with a message indicating the required type.\n3. If the input type is correct, the function calculates the new DateTime by adding the specified number of hours (default is +3) to the input.\n4. The new DateTime is returned as the output of the function.\n\nThis implementation adheres to the given task and special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":2.007243483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
