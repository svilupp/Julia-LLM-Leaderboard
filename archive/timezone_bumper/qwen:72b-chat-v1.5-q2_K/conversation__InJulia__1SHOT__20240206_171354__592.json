Please convert your Date to DateTime.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two versions of the `timezone_bumper` function. The first one takes a `DateTime` type as input and adds the specified number of hours. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n\nThe second version of the function takes a `Date` type as input. However, since the task requires handling only `DateTime` types, this function throws an error with an informative message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":7.538462383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
