The function checks if the input is indeed a `DateTime`. If it's not, it throws an error with a specific message. Otherwise, it calculates the new `DateTime` based on the provided input and the bump value.\n\nThe function then returns this newly calculated `DateTime`.\n\nFinally, the code includes a test case using the provided data to verify that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":10.748476929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
