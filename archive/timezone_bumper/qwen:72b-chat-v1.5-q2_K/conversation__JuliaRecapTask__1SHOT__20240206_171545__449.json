X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets: We need to work with DateTime types and throw errors if the input is not as expected.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt +Dates.Hour(bump))\nend\n\nfunction assert_datetime(dt)\n    isa(dt, DateTime) || error(\"Input must be a DateTime\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct: The function `timezone_bumper` increments the input DateTime by `bump` hours (defaulting to 3 hours). The `assert_datetime` function checks if the input is a DateTime and throws an error otherwise.\n\nWith these functions in place, you can use `timezone_bumper` with DateTime inputs and safely handle Date types with `assert_datetime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":7.979702166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
