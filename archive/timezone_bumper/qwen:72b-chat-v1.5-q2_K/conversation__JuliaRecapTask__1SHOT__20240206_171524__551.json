[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets: We need to work with DateTime types and throw errors if other types are provided.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Increase timestamp by 'bump' hours\n    new_dt = dt + Dates.Hour(bump))\n    \n    return new_dt\nend\n\n# Error handling for Date type input\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3) \n    error(\"Error: This function works only with DateTime types. Please convert the Date to DateTime first.\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The main `timezone_bumper` function correctly increases a DateTime by the specified number of hours.\n- A separate `timezone_bumper` function has been defined for Date input, which throws an error indicating that the function works only with DateTime types.\n\nThe solution is now complete.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":9.445092587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
