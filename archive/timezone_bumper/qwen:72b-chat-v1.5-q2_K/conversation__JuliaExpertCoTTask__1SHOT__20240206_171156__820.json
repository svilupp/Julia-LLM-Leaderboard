The function first checks if the input is a `DateTime`. If it's a `Date`, an error message is displayed. For any other input type, an error message is also shown.\n\nIf the input is a `DateTime`, the function adds `bump` hours to the input timestamp and returns the new `DateTime`.\n\nThe provided test data is used to call the `timezone_bumper` function, and the result is printed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":11.788390362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
