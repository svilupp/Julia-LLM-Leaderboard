If this condition fails, an error is thrown with the appropriate message.\n\nNext, the implementation checks that the input `bump` is a non-negative integer. If this condition fails, an error is thrown with the appropriate message.\n\nFinally, the implementation adds the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the input `dt`. The resulting value is returned from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.624456084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
