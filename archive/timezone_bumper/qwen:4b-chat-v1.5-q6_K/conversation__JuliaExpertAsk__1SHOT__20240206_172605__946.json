Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3))\n    if !isDateTime(dt)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"dt must be a DateTime type.\"))))\n    \n    bumped_time = dt + hours(bump))\n    \n    return bumped_time\nend\n```\n\nThis Julia function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments:\n\n1. `dt`: a `DateTime` object representing the timestamp you want to bump.\n2. `bump`: an optional `Int` value that represents the number of hours by which you want to bump the provided timestamp.\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function first checks whether the input `dt` is actually a `DateTime` type. If it's not, the function throws an error with the message \"dt must be a DateTime type.\"'.\n\nIf the input `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type, the function then calculates the bumped timestamp by adding the provided `bump` value to the provided `dt` value. This calculation is done using the `+` operator in Julia.\n\nFinally, the function returns the bumped timestamp calculated in the previous step.\n\nThis implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function ensures that it only works for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":2.453001932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
