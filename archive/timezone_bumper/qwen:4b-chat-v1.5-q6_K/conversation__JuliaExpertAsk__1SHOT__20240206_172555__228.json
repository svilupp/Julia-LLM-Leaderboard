If no `bump::Int` is provided, it defaults to +3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if the input object is of type `Date`. If it is, then an error message is thrown indicating that the `DateTime` type cannot be bumped for Date types.\n\nIf the input object is of type `DateTime`, then the number of hours specified by the optional argument `bump::Int` are added to the input object using the `+hours(bump))` syntax. The resulting `DateTime` object is returned as the output of the function.\n\nThis function handles both `DateTime` and `Date` types, ensuring that only valid input objects are processed correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[93,227],"elapsed":2.159949199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
