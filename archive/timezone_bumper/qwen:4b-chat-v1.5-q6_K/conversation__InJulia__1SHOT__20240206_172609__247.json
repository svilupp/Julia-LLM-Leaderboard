Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int))\n    # Check if input is of type DateTime\n    if !isdatetime!(dt))\n        throw(\"Input must be of type DateTime\")\n    end\n\n    # Increase timestamp by specified number of hours\n    dt += bump * 3600\n\n    return dt\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks whether the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error with a message indicating that the input must be of type `DateTime`.\n\nIf the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`, the function increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours. The resulting timestamp is then returned from the function.\n\nNote that the implementation assumes that the bump value passed to the function is non-negative and less than 24 hours (3600 seconds)). If the bump value violates these conditions, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.","status":200,"tokens":[65,211],"elapsed":2.000694617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
