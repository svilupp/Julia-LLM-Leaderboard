Bump must be between -23 and 23 hours.\")\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    dt += bump * 60\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in two arguments: `dt::DateTime` and `bump::Int`. It returns a modified version of `dt`, with the value increased by `bump` hours.\nThe function first checks that `bump >= -23 && bump <= 23 hours.` This ensures that `bump` is within the valid range. If `bump` is not within the valid range, the function prints an error message and returns nothing.\nAfter checking that `bump` is within the valid range, the function checks whether `bump < 0`. If `bump < 0`, this means that the value of `dt` should be decreased by `-bump` hours. However, since we're increasing the value of `dt` by `bump` hours, and decreasing the value of `dt` by `-bump` hours, it makes sense to simply avoid performing any decrease in the value of `dt`.\nTherefore, if `bump < 0`, the function simply prints an error message and returns nothing.\nIf `bump >= -23 && bump <= 23 hours.` and `bump > 0`, this means that we should increase the value of `dt` by `bump` hours. Since `bump > 0` implies that `bump` is a positive number, it makes sense to simply perform an increase in the value of `dt`. Therefore, if `bump >= -23 && bump <= 23 hours.` and `bump > 0`, the function simply performs an increase in the value of `dt` by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":4.100243773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
