[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Return the bumped timestamp.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    # Check if input is a DateTime\n    if !(dt isa DateTime))\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n\n    # Bump the timestamp by specified hours (default 3)\n    bumped_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n\n    return bumped_dt\nend\n```\n\nWith this function, you can bump a provided `DateTime` by specifying the number of hours to add. If you pass a `Date`, it will throw an error as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":2.456126913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
