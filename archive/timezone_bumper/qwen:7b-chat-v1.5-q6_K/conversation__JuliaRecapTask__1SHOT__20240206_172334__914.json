[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime, throw error for Date\n    if typeof(dt) != typeof(DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime\")\n    end\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by `bump` hours (default +3)\n    bumped_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n\n    return bumped_dt\nend\n```\n\nThis function now accepts a DateTime object and an optional bump value. It first checks if the input is indeed a DateTime, and throws an error if it's a Date.\n\nThen, it increases the timestamp by `bump` hours (defaulting to +3). Finally, it returns the bumped DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":2.20333196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
