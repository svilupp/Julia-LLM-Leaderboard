Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

The trend is then assigned to the `trend` field of the named tuple.\n\nFinally, the named tuple containing all the analyzed results is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":16.164675123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
