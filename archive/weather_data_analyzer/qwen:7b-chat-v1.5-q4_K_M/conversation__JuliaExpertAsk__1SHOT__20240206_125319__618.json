It first checks if the list is empty; if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, max, min temperatures and determines the trend based on whether the temperatures are increasing or decreasing. Finally, it constructs the named tuple with the analysis results and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.878073386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
