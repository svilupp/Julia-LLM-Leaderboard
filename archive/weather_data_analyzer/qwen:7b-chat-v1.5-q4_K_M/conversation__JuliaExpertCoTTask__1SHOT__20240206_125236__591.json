Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for the given task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing,\n                     min = nothing, trend = nothing))\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if all(temps .> avg_temp), \"increasing\"\n               elseif all(temps .< avg_temp), \"decreasing\"\n               else \"stable\"\n               end\n\n    result = (; average = avg_temp, max = max_temp,\n                       min = min_temp, trend = trend))\n\n    return result\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]]) \n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of daily temperature data as input and returns the statistical analysis results in the form of a named tuple.\n\nFor the given example `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, the function returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a \"stable\" trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":2.621473152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
