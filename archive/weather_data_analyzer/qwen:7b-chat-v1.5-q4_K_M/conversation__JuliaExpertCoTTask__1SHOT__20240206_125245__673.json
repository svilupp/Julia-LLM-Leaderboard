Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"``` julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average= nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend= nothing))\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = if all(x > y for (x, y) in zip(temps, temps[1:end-1]])))) :increasing\n    elseif all(x < y for (x, y) in zip(temps, temps[1:end-1]])))) :decreasing\n    else :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend))\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]])\n```\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` is given.
