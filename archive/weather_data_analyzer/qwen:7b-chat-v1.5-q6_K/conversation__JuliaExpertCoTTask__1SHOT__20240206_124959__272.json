Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average= nothing, max= nothing, min= nothing, trend= nothing))\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if all(t -> t isa Int, temps[2:end]) && temps[1] == min_temp\n                        :decreasing\n                    elseif all(t -> t isa Int, temps[2:end]]) && temps[end] == max_temp\n                        :increasing\n                    else\n                        :stable\n                    end\n\n    analysis_results = (;\n        average = avg_temp,\n        max = max_temp,\n        min = min_temp,\n        trend = trend\n    ))\n\n    return analysis_results\nend\n\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]])\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis code defines a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of daily temperatures as input.
