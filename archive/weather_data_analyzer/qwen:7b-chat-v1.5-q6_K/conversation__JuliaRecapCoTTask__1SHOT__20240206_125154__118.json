[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    isempty(temps) ? nothing : begin\n        # Calculate statistics\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        # Determine trend\n        if all(temps .> average_temp))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(temps .< average_temp)))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        # Create named tuple with results\n        result = (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of daily temperature data as input and returns statistical analysis results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. If the input list is empty, it creates a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`average_temp`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures.\n3. It determines the trend by checking if the temperature is consistently above or below the average. If no clear trend is observed, it is labeled as `:stable`.\n4. Finally, it creates a named tuple called `result` containing all the calculated statistics along with the determined trend.\n\nThe function can be used like this:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 28, 27, 26] # Daily temperature data\nanalysis = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(analysis)\n```\nThis will output the statistical analysis results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":4.26328795,"_type":"aimessage"}]
