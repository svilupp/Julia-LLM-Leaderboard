Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        result = (; average=nothing, max=nothing,\n                                  min=nothing, trend=nothing))\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(allIncreasing(temps)), :increasing,\n                                           ifelse(allDecreasing(temps)), :decreasing,\n                                           :stable)\n\n        result = (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp,\n                              trend=trend))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\n temps = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]]\n result = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n println(result)\n```\nThis code defines a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of daily temperatures as input.
