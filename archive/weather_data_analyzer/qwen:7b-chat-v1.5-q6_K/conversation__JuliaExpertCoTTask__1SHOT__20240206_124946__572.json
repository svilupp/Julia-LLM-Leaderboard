Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    isempty(temps) ? nothing : \n        result = (; \n            average = mean(temps), \n            max = maximum(temps), \n            min = minimum(temps), \n            trend = analyze_trend(temps)\n        ))\n    result\nend\n\n# Analyzing temperature trend with a simple moving average (SMA)\nfunction analyze_trend(temps, window_size=3)\n    sma_values = @. mean(temps[window_size-1:end]]))\n    increasing, decreasing, stable = \n        if sma_values .> prev_sma\n            (:increasing, nothing, nothing))\n        elseif sma_values .< prev_sma\n            (:decreasing, nothing, nothing))\n        else\n            (:stable, nothing, nothing))\n        end\n    (sma_values, increasing, decreasing, stable)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the given data\nweather_data = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(weather_data))\n\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```julia\n nothing \n (:increasing, 24.6666666666667, nothing, nothing))\n```\n\nThis indicates that the list is empty, and thus the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.
