If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task requires writing a Julia function called `weather_data_analyzer` that takes in an array of daily temperature data.
