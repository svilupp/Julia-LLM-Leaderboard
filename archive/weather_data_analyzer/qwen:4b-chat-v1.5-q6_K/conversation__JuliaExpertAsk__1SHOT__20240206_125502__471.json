Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function as described in the prompt, we need to import several packages and define the function accordingly.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nimport Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector))\n    # Check if input is a vector\n    @assert isvector(temps)\n\n    # Define variables for storing results\n    ave_temp = nothing\n    max_temp = nothing\n    min_temp = nothing\n    trend = nothing\n\n    # Perform statistical analyses on the input data\n    ave_temp = mean(temps))\n    max_temp = maximum(temps))\n    min_temp = minimum(temps))\n    trend = trend(temps))\n\n    # Construct and return a named tuple containing the results of the statistical analyses\n    result_tuple = (:average,ave_temp),(:max,max_temp),(:min,min_temp),(:trend,trend_value))\n    return result_tuple\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first define several variables to store the results of the statistical analyses. We then import the `Statistics` package and call its `weather_data_analyzer` function, passing it our list of daily temperature data.\n\nFinally, we construct and return a named tuple containing the results of the statistical analyses performed by our `weather_data_analyzer` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":2.628912064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
