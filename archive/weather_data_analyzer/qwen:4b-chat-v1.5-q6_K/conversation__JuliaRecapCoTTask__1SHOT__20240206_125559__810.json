[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, you will need to use the Statistics package in Julia. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. Load the Statistics package by using the following code:\n```python\nimport Statistics\n```\n\n2. Define a function called `weather_data_analyzer` that takes an input list called `temps` and returns a named tuple containing the required statistical analysis results.\n\nHere's an example of what the `weather_data_analyzer` function might look like:\n```python\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    stats = Statistics.describe(temps))\n    \n    result = (; key1=stats.mean, key2=stats.max, key3=stats.min, key4=trend(stats))})\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNote that this is just an example of how the `weather_data_analyzer` function might look like. You may need to modify it to suit your specific needs and requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[8,191],"elapsed":1.846996239,"_type":"aimessage"}]
