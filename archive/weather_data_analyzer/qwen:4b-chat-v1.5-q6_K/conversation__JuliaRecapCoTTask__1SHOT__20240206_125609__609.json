[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

We store this result in the `average` key of a named tuple called `results`.\n- Next, we use the `max()` function from the Statistics package to find the maximum temperature in the `temps` array. We store this result in the `max` key of the named tuple called `results`.\n- Similarly, we use the `min()` function from the Statistics package to locate the minimum temperature in the `temps` array. We store this result in the `min` key of the named tuple called `results`.\n- Once we have calculated all the temperatures and stored them in the `results` named tuple, we use a conditional statement (`if`) to determine whether there are any temperatures in the `results` named tuple.\n- If there are no temperatures in the `results` named tuple, then we can safely say that the temperatures in the `temps` array have been stable over time. In this case, we simply store the value of the `isX ? X : Y` ternary operator in the `trend` key of the `results` named tuple.\n- However, if there are any temperatures in the `results` named tuple, then we cannot be sure that the temperatures in the `temps` array have been stable over time. In this case, we simply store the value of the `isX ? X : Y` ternary operator in the `trend` key of the `results` named tuple.\n- Once we have calculated all the temperatures and stored them in the `results` named tuple, we use a conditional statement (`if`) to determine whether there are any temperatures in","status":200,"tokens":[0,528],"elapsed":5.077546955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
