Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if !isvector(temps)) || length(temps) == 0\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps))\n    \n    max_temp = maximum(temps))\n    \n    min_temp = minimum(temps))\n    \n    trend = increase_decrease_stable(avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp)))\nend\n```\n\nHere's how this function works:\n\n1. It first checks whether the input `temps` is a valid vector (i.e., not a string or other non-numeric data type)). If it's not, the function returns `nothing`.\n\n2. If `temps` is a valid vector, the function calculates the average (`avg_temp`) temperature in the vector.\n\n3. The function then calculates the maximum (`max_temp`) temperature in the vector.\n\n4. The function calculates the minimum (`min_temp`) temperature in the vector.\n\n5. The function finally determines whether the overall trend of temperatures in the vector is increasing, decreasing, or stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":2.174629563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
