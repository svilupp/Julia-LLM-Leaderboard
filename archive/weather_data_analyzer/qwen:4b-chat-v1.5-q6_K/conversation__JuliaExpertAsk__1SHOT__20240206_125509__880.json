Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia's built-in statistical functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps)) == 0\n        return nothing\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps))\n        max_temp = max(temps))\n        min_temp = min(temps))\n        \n        trend = :increasing if max_temp > avg_temp\n              trend = :decreasing if avg_temp > min_temp\n              trend = :stable if avg_temp == min_temp && max_temp == avg_temp\n              trend = :unknown\n\n        return (avg_temp, max_temp, min_temp, trend))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` and performs the required statistical analyses.
