Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing,\n                 max = nothing,\n                 min = nothing,\n                 trend = nothing))\n    end\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend\n    if length(unique(diff([1, temps...]))))) <= 1\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing if all(diff(temps)) .>= 0)\n        trend = :decreasing if all(diff(temps)) .<= 0)\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp,\n                 max = max_temp,\n                 min = min_temp,\n                 trend = trend))\nend\n\n# Test case\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes a list of daily temperatures and performs statistical analysis on them.
