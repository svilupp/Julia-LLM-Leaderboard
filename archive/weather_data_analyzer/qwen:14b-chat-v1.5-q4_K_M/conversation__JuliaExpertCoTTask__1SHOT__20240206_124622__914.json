Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        increasing = all(diff(sort(temps)))) .> 0)\n        decreasing = all(diff(sort(temps)))) .< 0)\n        stable = !increasing && !decreasing\n\n        trend = increasing ? :increasing :\n                 decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable\n\n        return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n\n# Test case\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe code defines a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes in a list of daily temperatures and performs statistical analysis as required.
