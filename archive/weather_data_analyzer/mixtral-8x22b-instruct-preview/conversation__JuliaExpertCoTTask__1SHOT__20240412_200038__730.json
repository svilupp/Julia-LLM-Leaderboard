Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"- Define a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes an array, `temps`, as input and returns the statistical analyses as specified in the task.\n- Import the `Statistics` package.\n- Calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using the respective functions from the `Statistics` package: `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`.\n- Determine the `trend` using a loop.
