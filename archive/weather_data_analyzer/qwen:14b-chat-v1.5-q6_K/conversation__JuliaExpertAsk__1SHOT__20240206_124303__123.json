Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function using the `Statistics` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;\n            average=nothing,\n            max=nothing,\n            min=nothing,\n            trend=nothing,\n        )\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    increasing = all(diff(sort(temps)))) .> 0)\n    decreasing = all(diff(sort(temps)))) .< 0)\n    stable = !increasing && !decreasing\n\n    trend = stable ? :stable :\n             decreasing ? :decreasing : :increasing\n\n    return (;\n        average=avg,\n        max=max_temp,\n        min=min_temp,\n        trend=trend,\n    )\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty.
