Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will follow the Problem Solving Steps and use Julia's `Statistics` package for statistical calculations.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Perform statistical calculations\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend based on average change\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        avg_change = diff([average_temp, last(temps)]))\n        if avg_change[1] > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg_change[1] < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = nothing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data:\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will output the results of the statistical analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[270,300],"elapsed":10.66776633,"_type":"aimessage"}]
