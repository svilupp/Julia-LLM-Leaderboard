Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function using the `Statistics` package in Julia. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to write this function:\n\n1. Import the `Statistics` package.\n2. Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes the list `temps` as input.\n3. Check if the list is empty, and return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. If the list is not empty, calculate the average, max, and min temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n5. Determine the trend of the temperatures by comparing consecutive temperature differences. If all differences are positive or zero, it's `:increasing`. If all differences are negative or zero, it's `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it's `:stable`.\n6. Return a named tuple containing the calculated statistics and trend.\n\nHere's the Julia code for this function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    temp_differences = diff(temps)\n    increasing = all(temp_differences .>= 0))\n    decreasing = all(temp_differences .<= 0))\n    stable = !increasing && !decreasing\n\n    trend = ifelse(increasing, :increasing, \n                                           decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable))\n\n    return (average = average_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nThis code defines the `weather_data_analyzer` function with the required functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":6.998469609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
