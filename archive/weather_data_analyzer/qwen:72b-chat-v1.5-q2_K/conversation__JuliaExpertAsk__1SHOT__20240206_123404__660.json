Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number}}) \n    isempty(temps) && return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if min_temp < avg_temp < max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < avg_temp < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` takes a list of temperature data as input. It first checks if the list is empty; if so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using Julia's `Statistics` package.\n\nNext, the function determines the trend of the temperature data. If the average temperature is between the minimum and maximum temperatures, the trend is considered `:increasing`. If the reverse is true (average is between max and min but in the opposite order), the trend is considered `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if the minimum and maximum temperatures are equal or the average temperature lies exactly at the extreme values, the trend is considered `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":14.307314811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
