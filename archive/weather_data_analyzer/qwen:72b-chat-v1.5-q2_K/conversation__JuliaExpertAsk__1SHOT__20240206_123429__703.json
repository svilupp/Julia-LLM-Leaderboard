Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number}}) \n    isempty(temps) && return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if max_temp > min_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` vector is empty. If it is, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned.\n\nIf the `temps` vector is not empty, the function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe trend (`:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`) is determined by comparing the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the maximum is greater than the minimum, the trend is `:increasing`. If the maximum is less than the minimum, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, a named tuple with the calculated values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":13.216176861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
