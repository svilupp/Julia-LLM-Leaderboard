Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Here's the code for the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number}}) \n    n = length(temps)\n    \n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:stable))\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if max_temp > min_temp \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif max_temp < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` vector is empty. If it is, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned.\n\nIf the `temps` vector is not empty, statistical analyses are performed using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe trend is determined based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than or less than the minimum temperature. If they are equal, the trend is considered stable.\n\nFinally, a named tuple with the results of the statistical analysis is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":13.264201766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
