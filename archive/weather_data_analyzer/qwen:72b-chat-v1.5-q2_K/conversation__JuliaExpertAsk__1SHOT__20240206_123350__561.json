Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number}}) \n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if isincreasing(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif isdecreasing(temps)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average = average_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `weather_data_analyzer` first checks if the input temperature data `temps` is empty.

If neither condition is met, it assumes the trend is stable.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[172,283],"elapsed":12.987808907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
