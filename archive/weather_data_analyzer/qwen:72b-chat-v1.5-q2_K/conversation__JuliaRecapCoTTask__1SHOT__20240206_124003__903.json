[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"As there are no specific special instructions, I'll proceed with the standard approach.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we have the `Statistics` package installed. In Julia, you can add packages with the command `add PackageName`. However, since I am not currently running a Julia session, I cannot execute this command directly. Instead, please run `add Statistics` in your Julia environment if it is not already installed.\n\nWith the `Statistics` package installed, we can now proceed to define the function `weather_data_analyzer`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Number}) :: NamedTuple\n    isempty(temps) && return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing))\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    if isnothing(min) || isnothing(max)\n        trend = nothing\n    elseif max > min\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (average = average, max = max, min = min, trend = trend))\nend\n```\n\nNow we have a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes in a list of daily temperatures and returns a named tuple with statistical results.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with a vector of temperature data:\n\n```julia\ntemps_example = [20, 18, 25, 23, 27]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps_example)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the named tuple containing the statistical results for the given temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":15.740546157,"_type":"aimessage"}]
