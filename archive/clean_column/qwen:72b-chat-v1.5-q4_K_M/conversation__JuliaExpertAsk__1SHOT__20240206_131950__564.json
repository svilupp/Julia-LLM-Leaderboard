It first strips leading and trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. Then it lowers the case of the string with `lowercase`. To replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, the `replace` function is used with a regular expression pattern to match spaces and hyphens (`r\"\\s|-\"`). Finally, an additional underscore is appended at the end for consistency in the output format.","status":200,"tokens":[98,127],"elapsed":7.624196609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
