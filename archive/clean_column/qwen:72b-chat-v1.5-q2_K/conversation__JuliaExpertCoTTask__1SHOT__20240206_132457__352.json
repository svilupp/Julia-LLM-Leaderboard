The function performs the necessary operations to clean the column name according to the provided specifications.\n\nAfter defining the function, the code tests it using the given example `\"My Column\"`. It then prints the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,138],"elapsed":6.113635616,"_type":"aimessage"}]
