[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the task description and since no special instructions were provided, I will proceed to write the `clean_column` function using the guidelines mentioned earlier.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    str = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n    str = lstrip(rstrip(str))\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    str = replace(str, \" \" => \"_\")\n    str = replace(str, \"-\" => \"_\")\n\n    return str\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` representing the column name to be cleaned. It then follows the steps mentioned in the task description to clean the column name.\n\nNow that the function is defined, you can test it with different input strings to verify its correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":7.571993954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
