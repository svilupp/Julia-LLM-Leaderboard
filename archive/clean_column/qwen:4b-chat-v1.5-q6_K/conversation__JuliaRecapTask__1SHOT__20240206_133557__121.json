[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) as described in the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return lowercase(col) . trim(col) . replace(col, \"_\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a single argument `col`, which is the column name to be cleaned. \n\nThe function uses multiple string operations to clean the input column name. It first converts the input column name to lowercase using the built-in Julia function `lowercase`. \n\nNext, it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces that may have been added during conversion to lowercase. This can be achieved using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions like `trim` and `replace`.\n\nFinally, the function replaces any spaces and hyphens in the input column name with an underscore. This is done using Julia's built-in string manipulation functions like `replace`.\n\nThe function then returns the cleaned column name as a result of all the string operations that were performed on it.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[338,223],"elapsed":2.206930188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
