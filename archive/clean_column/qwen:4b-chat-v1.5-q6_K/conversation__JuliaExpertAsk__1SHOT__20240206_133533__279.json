The function first converts the input column name to a string. Then it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string. Next it converts all characters in the string to lowercase. Then it replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `replace` function. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,144],"elapsed":1.350967289,"_type":"aimessage"}]
