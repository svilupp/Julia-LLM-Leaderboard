[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\":\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, \" \", \"-\", \"_\"))\n\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with different column names:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Original Column Name: My Column\")\ncol_name = \"My Column\"\ncol = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(\"Cleaned Column Name: my_column\")\nprintln(\"Cleaned Column Value: \", col)\n```\n\nThis should output the original and cleaned column name, as well as the cleaned column value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":2.018415814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
