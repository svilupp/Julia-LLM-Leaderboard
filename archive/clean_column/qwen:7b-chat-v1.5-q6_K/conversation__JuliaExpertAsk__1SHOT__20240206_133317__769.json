Then, the `trim` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n\nNext, a regular expression (re) pattern `r\"[\\s-]+\", re)` is used with the `match` function. This pattern matches one or more spaces or hyphens and replaces them with an underscore.\n\nFinally, the cleaned column name is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,141],"elapsed":1.683555242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
