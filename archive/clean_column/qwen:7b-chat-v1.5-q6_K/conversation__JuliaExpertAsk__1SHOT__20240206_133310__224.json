The `clean_column` function takes a column name as input.\n2. The `lowercase` function is used to convert the entire column to lowercase.\n3. `strtrim` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces.\n4. The regular expression `[isspace()]]` is used to check for whitespace characters only, which are then removed with `strtrim`.\n5. The final result is a cleaned column name with all lowercase, leading/trailing whitespaces removed, and any spaces or hyphens replaced by an underscore.\n\nYou can now use this function on any column name to clean it:\n\n```julia\ncol_name = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_col_name = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(cleaned_col_name)  # Output: my_column\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,202],"elapsed":2.456666977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
