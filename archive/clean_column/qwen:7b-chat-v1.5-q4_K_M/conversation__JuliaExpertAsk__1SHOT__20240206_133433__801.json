The `clean_column` function takes a string `col` as input.\n2. `lowercase()` is used to convert the entire column name to lowercase.\n3. `strip(string(col)), \" \\t-\\n\")` removes leading and trailing whitespaces, as well as any spaces and hyphens that may be present in the middle of the string.\n4. Finally, all remaining non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with an underscore using the ASCII replacement rule.\n\nThe function returns the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,143],"elapsed":1.479363672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
