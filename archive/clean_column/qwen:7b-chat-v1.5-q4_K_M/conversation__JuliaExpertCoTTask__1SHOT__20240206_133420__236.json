It first converts the input string to lowercase and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n\nNext, it replaces spaces with underscores and hyphens with underscores in between hyphens (to maintain a consistent naming format).\n\nFinally, the cleaned column name is returned. In the provided example \"My Column\", the function returns \"my_column\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":1.544186378,"_type":"aimessage"}]
