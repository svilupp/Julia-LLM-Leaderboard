Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's the code for the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter by manufacturer and model\n    filtered_df = df_cars[df_cars[:manufacturer]] .== \"audi\", \n                                  :model] .== (\"a4\" | \"a4 quattro\"))\n    \n    # Create new column with true values\n    filtered_df[:audi_a4_ type] .= true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\nresult\n```\n\nThis will filter the DataFrame based on the criteria and return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":3.233613513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
