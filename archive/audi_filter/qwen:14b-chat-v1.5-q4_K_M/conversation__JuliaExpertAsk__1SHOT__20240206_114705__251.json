Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = df_cars[df_cars[:manufacturer]] .== \"audi\", :]\n    \n    model_conditions = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    df_filtered[:, :audi_a4_type]] .= any.(model_conditions .=> df_filtered[:, :model]]),)\n\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function `audi_filter` filters the given DataFrame `df_cars` based on the manufacturer and model conditions.
