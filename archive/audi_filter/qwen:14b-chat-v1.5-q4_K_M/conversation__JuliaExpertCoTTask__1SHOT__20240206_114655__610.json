It then creates a new column indicating whether the row matches the criteria or not.\n\nAfter defining the function, you can test it by passing the `df_cars` DataFrame to `audi_filter`. The resulting filtered DataFrame will be stored in `df_cars_filtered`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":3.397615628,"_type":"aimessage"}]
