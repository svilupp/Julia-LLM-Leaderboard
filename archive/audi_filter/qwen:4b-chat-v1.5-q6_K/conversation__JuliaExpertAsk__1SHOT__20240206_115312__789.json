Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function audi_filter written in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = df_cars[manufacturer == \"audi\"] && model ∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]]\n    \n    # Create new column `audi_a4_ type` that equals `true` across all rows.\n    df_filtered[\"audi_a4_type\"] = true\n\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the function audi_filter:\n\n```julia\n# Load data from CSV file into DataFrame df_cars.\ndf_cars = read.csv(\"cars_data.csv\"))\n\n# Call audi_filter function on df_cars DataFrame and assign returned value to new DataFrame df_filtered.\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars))\n\n# Print first few rows of df_filtered DataFrame.\nprintln(df_filtered[1:5]]))\n```\n\nThis code will load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame `df_cars`. It will then call the function `audi_filter` on `df_cars` DataFrame and assign returned value to new DataFrame `df_filtered`. Finally, it will print first few rows of `df_filtered` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.285302182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
