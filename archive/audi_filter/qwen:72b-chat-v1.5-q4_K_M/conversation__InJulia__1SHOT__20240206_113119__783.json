Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's how to write the `audi_filter` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n\n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_ type] = true\n\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first filter the DataFrame `df_cars` using a lambda function that checks if the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The filtered DataFrame is stored in `df_filtered`.\n\nNext, we add a new column named `:audi_a4_type` to `df_filtered`, setting its value to `true` across all rows.\n\nFinally, we return the resulting DataFrame `df_filtered`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":11.814716093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
