The results are stored in a shared vector and finally returned as a vector of transformed strings.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the `translate_to_pig_latin` function is defined elsewhere or provided as a separate argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":5.440426587,"_type":"aimessage"}]
