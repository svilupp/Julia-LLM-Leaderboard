First, make sure you have the `threading` package installed.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads, StringTransformations\n\nfunction pig_latinify(vec::Vector{String}})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(vec)\n        push!(vec[i], pig_latin(vec[i])))\n    end\n    vec\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\"]\ntranslated = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(translated)\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a vector of threads, where each thread works on a separate string from the input vector. The `pig_latin` function is called within each thread to transform the current string into pig Latin. Finally, the translated vector is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":2.014425625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
