When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Import necessary modules:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n```\n2. Define the `pig_latinify` function:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String}})\n    @threads for i in eachindex(strs)\n        push!(strs[i], convert(String, \"way\")) # Pig Latin rule\n        append!(strs[i], strip(string(last(strs[i].end朝朝暮暮)))))) # Remove leading and trailing characters\n        end\n    return strs\nend\n```\n3. Test the function using the provided data:\n```julia\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_strs = pig_latinify(strs)\nprintln(transformed_strs)\n```\nThis code will create a vector of threads that transform each input string to pig Latin, all running in parallel. The transformed strings will be stored in the `transformed_strs` variable and printed out for verification.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":2.755965012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
