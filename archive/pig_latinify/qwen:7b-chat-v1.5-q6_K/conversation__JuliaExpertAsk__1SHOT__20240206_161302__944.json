It also uses the `thread::spawn` function to create and start separate threads for each string in a vector.\n\nThe code then iterates over the vector, spawning a new thread for each string. The transformed results are not handled directly within the threads; instead, you would need to integrate that into your application's architecture.\n\nFinally, the code uses `futures::future::try_join_all` to wait for all threads to complete before exiting the script.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":3.85135698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
