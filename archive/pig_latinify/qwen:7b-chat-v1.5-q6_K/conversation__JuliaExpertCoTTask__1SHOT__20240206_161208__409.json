The `pig_latinify` function processes each string in a separate thread using the `Threads.@spawn` macro. It then stores the transformed string back to the main thread using an async callback (`yield()`). Finally, it collects all transformed strings into a single vector and returns it.\n\nThe provided test data is used to demonstrate the functionality of the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":5.176401288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
