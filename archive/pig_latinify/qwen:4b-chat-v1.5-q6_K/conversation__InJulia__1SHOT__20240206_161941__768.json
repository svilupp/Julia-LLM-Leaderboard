Each iteration over each string in the input vector performs a pig Latin translation on it, and submits the result to the current thread's task queue. Finally, it returns a vector of strings containing the translated pig Latin strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":2.45808877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
