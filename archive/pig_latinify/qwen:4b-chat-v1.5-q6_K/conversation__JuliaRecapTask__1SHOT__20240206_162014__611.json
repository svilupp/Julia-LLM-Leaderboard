[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformer should iterate over each string and change it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the Problem\nTo write the `pig_latinify` transformer, we first need to determine what problem we are trying to solve. In this case, we want to transform strings from English to Pig Latin.\n\n## Step 2: Develop an Understanding of Pig Latin\nBefore writing the `pig_latinify` transformer, it is essential to have a good understanding of Pig Latin. This will allow us to correctly transform strings from English to Pig Latin.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Input and Output Types for the Transformer\nTo write the `pig_latinify` transformer, we need to determine the input and output types for the transformer. In this case, we want to transform strings from English to Pig Latin. Therefore, the input type for the transformer will be a string of English characters. Similarly, the output type for the transformer will also be a string of English characters.\n\n## Step 4: Write the Code for the Transformer\nTo write the `pig_latinify` transformer, we need to write the code for the transformer. In this case, we want to transform strings from English to Pig Latin. Therefore, the code for the transformer will include several lines of code that will be executed on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.129770369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
