It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}}, num_threads::Int)\n    # Split strings into words\n    words = split(strings, \" \"))\n    \n    # Create threads for each word\n    threads = collect(Parallel.@threads(words[i]], num_threads) for i = 1:length(words))\n    \n    # Join threads and concatenate words to form pig latin\n    pig_latin = join(threads, :)) + \"ay\"\n    \n    # Return pig Latin words\n    return words[pig_latin == \"ay\"}]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `Parallel` module in Julia to create threads for each word. It then joins the threads and concatenates the words to form pig latin. Finally, it returns the pig latin words.\nNote that this implementation assumes that all strings in the input vector are valid English words. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":1.968152721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
