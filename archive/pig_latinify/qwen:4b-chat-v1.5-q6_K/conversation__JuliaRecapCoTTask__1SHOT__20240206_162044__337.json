X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Write a Julia function called `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings as input.\n\n2. Implement multiple threads to speed up the processing time.\n\n3. Use a combination of string manipulation functions, data structures like arrays and tuples, and thread management techniques to efficiently process and output the pig Latin versions of the input strings.\n\n4. Test the `pig_latinify` function with various test cases, including both simple and complex cases that showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of the `pig_latinify` function in processing and outputting the pig Latin versions of the input strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,134],"elapsed":1.285064021,"_type":"aimessage"}]
