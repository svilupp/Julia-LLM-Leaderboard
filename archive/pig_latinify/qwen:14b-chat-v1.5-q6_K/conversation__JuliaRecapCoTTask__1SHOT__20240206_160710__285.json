[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Ensure the final output is a vector of transformed strings.\n\nHere's the code to solve this task:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    function transform(string)\n        # Pig Latin rules: move consonants after 'a' or 'e'\n        # If starts with vowel, add \"way\" and return; otherwise transform normally.\n        if startswith(string, \"aeiou\"))\n            return string*\"way\"\n        end\n\n        last_consonant_idx = findlast(isalpha, string) .- 1)\n        if last_consonant_idx == -1\n            # All-vowel word, add \"ay\" and return; otherwise transform normally.\n            return string*\"ay\"\n        else\n            # Insert 'way' after the consonants (or 'ay' if all-vowel)\n            return string[1:last_consonant_idx+2] .*\n                    (last_consonant_idx == length(string) - 2 ? \"ay\" : \"way\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Create a thread pool and transform each string in parallel\n    threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    transformed_strings = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings)))\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for i in 1:length(strings)\n            # Launch a new thread to process the current string\n            @spawn transformed_strings[i] = transform(strings[i])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_strings\nend\n```\nThis code defines the `pig_latinify` function, which takes a vector of strings as input. It creates a thread pool using Julia's multithreading capabilities and processes each string in parallel.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that words with consecutive consonants should keep only the last consonant (e.g., \"banana\" becomes \"ananabay\"). If you need a different rule, you can modify the `transform` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":8.734299312,"_type":"aimessage"}]
