[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll then use Julia's multi-threading capabilities by employing the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        # Perform pig latin transformation\n        # Assuming vowels are \"aeiou\"\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(isin(\"aeiou\"), s), 1)\n\n        if first_vowel_index === nothing\n            # No vowels found at the beginning, so move the entire string to the end and add \"ay\"\n            pig_latin_form = join(s[2:end]...), \"\") * \"ay\"\n        else\n            # Move the substring after the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\"\n            pig_latin_form = s[first_vowel_index:end]...\n                * (s[1:first_vowel_index]] == \"\" ? \"\" : \"way\")\n        end\n\n        strings[i] = pig_latin_form\n    end\n\n    strings\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the iterations over the input strings. It then performs the pig latin transformation on each string and updates the original vector.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":5.618556674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
