It uses multiple threads with `Threads.@threads` to process each string in parallel.\n\nNote: The provided example is simplified and assumes that the pig latin transformation logic consists only of appending \"ay\" to the word. You should replace this logic with your own implementation according to the rules of pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":4.978889213,"_type":"aimessage"}]
