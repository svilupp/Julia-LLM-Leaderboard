The function uses the Plingual library for translation and parallel execution using Julia's `Threads` library.\n\nTo run the provided data:\n```julia\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will output the pig Latin translations of the given strings.","status":200,"tokens":[177,477],"elapsed":14.051492065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
