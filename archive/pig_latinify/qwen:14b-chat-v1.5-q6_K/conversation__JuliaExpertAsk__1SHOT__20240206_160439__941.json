It creates an array of threads and assigns each thread to process one string.\n\nThe worker function performs the actual transformation from English to Pig Latin. After all threads have completed their work, the function returns the modified vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":4.372656812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
