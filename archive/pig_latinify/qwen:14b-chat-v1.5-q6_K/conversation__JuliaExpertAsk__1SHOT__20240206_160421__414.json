If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n            # 2. If the word starts with a consonant, move the first letter to the end, then add \"ay\".\n\n            if has_vowel(str[1]))\n                pig_latin = str * \"way\"\n            else\n                first_consonant = str[2:end][1])\n                rest_of_word = str[2:end][2:end]...]\n                pig_latin = rest_of_word * (first_consonant * \"ay\")))\n            end\n\n            strings[i] = pig_latin\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Test the function\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a separate thread for each input string, ensuring parallel processing. The pig Latin rules are applied within the threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":5.144964376,"_type":"aimessage"}]
