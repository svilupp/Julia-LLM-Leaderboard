The `Base.PigLatin` struct is used to perform the actual Pig Latin conversion.\n\nPlease note that Julia's parallelism is based on processes, not threads, by default. To enable threading in this example, you might need to adjust your Julia environment or use the `Threads.@threads` macro explicitly.\n:\n:","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":4.088382436,"_type":"aimessage"}]
