[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll utilize Julia's `Threads` library to parallelize the transformation process.\n\nHere's how you can implement `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    # Consonant cluster finder (leaves only first consonant)\n    first_consonant = findfirst(isletter, word[2:end])) == nothing ? word[1] : word[findfirst(isletter, word[2:end])) + 1]\n\n    # Pig latin rule: move initial consonant to end and append \"ay\"\n    return word * (isalpha(first_consonant)) ? \"ay\" : \"\")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    threads = Vector{Thread}()\n    \n    for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n        thread = Threads.init(() -> to_pig_latin(string)))\n        push!(threads, thread)\n    end\n    \n    for thread in threads\n        join(thread)\n    end\n    \n    return strings .=> s -> getfield(s, :value))\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `to_pig_latin` is a single-threaded function that converts a single word to pig latin. The main `pig_latinify` function uses Julia's `Threads` library to create and manage separate threads for each input string.\n\nRemember to import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n```\nNow you can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings as an argument.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":6.455292823,"_type":"aimessage"}]
