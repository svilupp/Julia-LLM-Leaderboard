[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll then use Julia's multithreading capabilities by utilizing the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @threads for (index, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        # Pig Latin rules: Move first consonant to end, add \"ay\"\n        piglat_str = String[substr(str, i), 1) for i in 2:length(substr(str, startof(str)!>1),))]'*\"ay\"$\n        \n        # Replace original string with the pig latin version\n        strings[index] = piglat_str\n    end\n\n    return strings\nend\n```\nThis implementation defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings and returns another vector with each string translated to pig latin. The translation is performed in separate threads using Julia's multithreading facilities.","status":200,"tokens":[327,223],"elapsed":4.418421534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
