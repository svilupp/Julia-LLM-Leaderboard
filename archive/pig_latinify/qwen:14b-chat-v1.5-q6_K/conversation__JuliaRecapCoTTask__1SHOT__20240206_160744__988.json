[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Create an instance of the `Threads.@threads` macro, which allows us to execute each iteration on a separate thread.\n3. Iterate over the input vector using the `@threads` macro and apply the `pig_latinify` function to each string in parallel.\n4. Return the transformed vector of strings.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str)\n    # Implement your Pig Latin rules here, for example:\n    if str[1] in 'aeiou'\n        return \"$(str)[1:end-1]]ay$(split(str, \"\")[end])\")\n    else\n        first_letter = split(str, \"\")[1]\n        return \"$(first_letter)way$(replace(str, first_letter => \"\"), 1))\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(v::Vector{String})\n    @threads for (i, str) in enumerate(v)\n        v[i] = pig_latinify(str)\n    end\n    return v\nend\n```\nYou can now call the `pig_latinify_vector` function with a vector of strings to transform them into Pig Latin. Each iteration will run on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":5.386132935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
