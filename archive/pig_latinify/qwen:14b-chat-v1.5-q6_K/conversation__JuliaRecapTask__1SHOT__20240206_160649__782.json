[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Define a helper function to convert a single string to pig latin.\n2. Use a `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the conversion of each string.\n3. Combine the results from all threads.\n\nHere's the Julia code:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if occursin(vowels, word) || startswith(word, 'y'))\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_char = first(word)\n        return word[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads results = [to_pig_latin(string) for string in strings]\n    return results\nend\n```\nNow you can use the `pig_latinify` function to convert a vector of strings into pig latin, with each iteration running on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":4.376903953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
