It then iterates over each string and applies the rules of Pig Latin to transform it.\n\nEach iteration is run on a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`. The transformed words are collected in a vector, which is returned by the function.\n\nFinally, the code demonstrates the usage of the function by applying it to an example list of words. The transformed words are then printed for verification.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":16.135503878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
