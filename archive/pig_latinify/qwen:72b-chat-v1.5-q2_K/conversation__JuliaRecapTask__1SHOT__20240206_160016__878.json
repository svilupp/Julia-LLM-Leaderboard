[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Additionally, we'll use Julia's threading capabilities to process each string in a vector concurrently.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    # Rule 1: If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n    if occursin(\"aeiou\", word[1]))\n        return join([word, \"way\"], \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Rule 2: If the word starts with a consonant, move all consecutive consonants to the end, then add \"ay\".\n    return join(filter(isletter, word[1:end-1])) .|>\n        {s -> join([word, s, \"ay\"], \"\")}, \"\")\nend\n\nfunction parallel_pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(string)\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use the `parallel_pig_latinify` function to transform a vector of strings into pig latin, running each transformation on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":12.074633401,"_type":"aimessage"}]
