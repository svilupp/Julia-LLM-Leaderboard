It uses Julia's `@spawn` macro to run each transformation on a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is used to transform a single word into pig latin. It checks if the word contains any vowels, and then constructs the pig latin form accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":9.760522589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
