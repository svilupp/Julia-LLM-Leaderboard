Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) -> Vector{String}\n    result = similar(words)  # Create a new vector with the same size\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_vowel = findfirst(isequal('a'), word.lower()) - 1\n    if first_vowel == 0\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[first_vowel+1:end])$(word[1:first_vowel])ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latinify` and `pig_latin`. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, applies the `pig_latin` transformation on each string in parallel using Julia's threading capabilities.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function itself implements the pig latin rule for transforming individual words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":10.925283736,"_type":"aimessage"}]
