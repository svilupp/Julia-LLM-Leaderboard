[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, I'll implement a multi-threaded approach for iterating over each string and converting it to pig latin.\n\nLet's start by defining the necessary utility functions:\n\n```julia\n# Utility function to convert a word to Pig Latin\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    ends_with_vowel = occursin(vowels, lastword)\n\n    if isuppercase(firstchar(word)))\n        return uppercasefirst(to_pig_latin(lowercase(word))))\n    else\n        if ends_with_vowel\n            return join([word[1:i] for i in 1:length(word)-1], '') * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return join([word[1:i] for i in 1:length(word)-2]], '') * lastword(word) * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Function to check if the first character of a string is uppercase\nisuppercasefirst(x::AbstractString) = isuppercase(firstchar(x))\n```\n\nNow, let's define `pig_latinify` and implement the multi-threaded approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(strings)))\n    \n    # Create a thread for each string in the input array\n    Threads.@threads for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(str)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with each string transformed into Pig Latin. The multi-threaded approach is achieved by using the `Threads.@threads` directive to create a separate thread for each string in the input array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":18.801683276,"_type":"aimessage"}]
