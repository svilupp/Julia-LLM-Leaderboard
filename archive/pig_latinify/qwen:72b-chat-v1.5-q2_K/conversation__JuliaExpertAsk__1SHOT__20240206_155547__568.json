It creates an output array with the same length.\n\nThe function uses a `@threads` macro to run each iteration in a separate thread. The actual transformation from English to Pig Latin is done by the `pig_latin` function, which is included in this code snippet for completeness.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":10.267268103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
