[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

In Pig Latin, we move the first consonant cluster to the end and add \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, we just add \"way\" at the end.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString}) :: Vector{AbstractString}\n    results = similar(words)\n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if occursin(r\"[aeiouyAEIOUY]\", word[1])\n            results[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            consonants = r\"^[^aeiouyAEIOUY]*\"\n            first_cluster = match(consonants, word))\n            end_cluster = \"\"\n            if isnothing(first_cluster)\n                end_cluster = \"ay\"\n            else\n                end_cluster = first_cluster.match * \"ay\"\n            end\n            \n            results[i] = word[end_cluster:end] * end_cluster\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use this function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)  # [\"appway\", \"banway\", \"cheryway\"]\n```\nPlease note that since Julia is not natively designed for multithreading, the performance benefit from using threads may be limited in some cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":15.324574033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
