[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function will take a vector of strings as input.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = similar(strings)  # Preallocate result array\n    @threads for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        results[i] = pig_latin_transform(s)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNow we need to define the `pig_latin_transform` function which will transform a single string into pig latin.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::String)\n    # Add your pig latin transformation logic here\n    # This is just an example, you might want to use a more complex rule\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nNow the `pig_latinify` function will take each string in parallel and transform it into pig latin.\n\nRemember that actual implementation of pig latin rules can vary, so this solution is a starting point. You may need to adjust or expand the transformation logic depending on the specific requirements for Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":11.7996603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
