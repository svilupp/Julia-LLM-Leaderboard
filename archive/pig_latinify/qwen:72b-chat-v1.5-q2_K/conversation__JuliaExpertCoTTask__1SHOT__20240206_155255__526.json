It then uses the `@threads` macro to run each translation on a separate thread.\n\nThe `translate_word` function is responsible for converting an individual word into Pig Latin. This function checks if the first vowel occurs after the first letter, and then returns the appropriate Pig Latin form.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":10.3329118,"_type":"aimessage"}]
