The main function `pig_latinify` iterates over each string in the input vector on separate threads, transforming them into pig latin using the `pig_latin` function. Finally, it returns a new vector containing the transformed words.\n\nThe code ends with a test of the `pig_latinify` function using the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":11.004697766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
