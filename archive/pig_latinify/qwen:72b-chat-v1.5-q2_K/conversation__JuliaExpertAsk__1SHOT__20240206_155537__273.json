Here's an implementation using `Threads`:\n\n```julia\n# Define a helper function for Pig Latin transformation\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    if starts_with(word, \"qu\")\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])\" * \"ay\"\n    else\n        vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n        is_vowel = x -> any(v -> v == x, vowels)\n\n        first_consonants = filter(is_vowel, word)[1] |> nothing\n\n        if first_consonants === nothing\n            return \"$(word)ay\"\n        else\n            return \"$(word[2:end])$(first_consonants)$word\" * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Define the main function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin on separate threads.\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        results[i] = join(filter(x -> x != nothing), [\n            pig_latin_word(word) for word in split(str)\n        ]))\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nTo test the function, you can use:\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"quacky\"]\nresults = pig_latinify(strings)\n\nfor (original, transformed) in zip(strings, results)\n    @info \"Original: $original -> Pig Latin: $transformed\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code should create a multithreaded function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":15.927089421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
