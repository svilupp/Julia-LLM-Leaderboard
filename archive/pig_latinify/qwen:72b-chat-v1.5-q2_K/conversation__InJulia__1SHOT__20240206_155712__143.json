First, ensure that you have at least Julia version 1.3 or later, as threading was introduced in version 1.3.\n\nHere's the implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Helper function to transform a single word into Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if in(word[1], vowels)\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    else\n        return \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    @threads for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n        result = join(string |> split |> x -> pig_latin_word(x)), \" \")\n        results[i] = result\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings_to_transform = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_strings = pig_latinify(strings_to_transform)\n\nprintln(\"Transformed strings:\")\nfor string in transformed_strings\n    println(string)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input, transforms each string into Pig Latin using the `pig_latin_word` helper function, and returns a vector of transformed strings.\n\nThe implementation uses Julia's multithreading capabilities via the `Threads` module. It launches separate threads for each iteration over the input strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":15.652697311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
