[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere's the solution with the requested features, including the `Instructions`. I'll use Julia's standard library for threading (`Threads`), and create a function that transforms strings into Pig Latin.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Function to transform a single word to pig latin\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    if isuppercase(first(word)))\n        return lowercase(word[2:end]) * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings into pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    @threads for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        words = split(str)\n        transformed_words = map(pig_latin_word, words)\n        results[i] = join(transformed_words, \" \")\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings_to_transform = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_strings = pig_latinify(strings_to_transform)\n\nprintln(\"Transformed Strings:\")\nfor (i, str) in enumerate(transformed_strings)\n    println(\"($i): $str\")\nend\n```\n\nThis solution defines the `pig_latin_word` function to transform a single word into Pig Latin. Then, it defines the main `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings and transforms each string into Pig Latin using multiple threads via Julia's `Threads` module.\n\nTo use this solution, simply copy and paste the code into a Julia session or save it as a `.jl` file and run it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":15.42399947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
