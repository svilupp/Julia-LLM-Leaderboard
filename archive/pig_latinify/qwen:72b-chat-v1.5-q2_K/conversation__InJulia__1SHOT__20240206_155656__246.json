Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = similar(words)  # Create a vector to store the transformed words\n    threads = 1:length(words)  # Define a range for each thread\n\n    # Iterate over each word and transform it in a separate thread\n    Threads.@threads for i in threads\n        index = i - 1  # Index adjustment because we want to access 'results[index]'\n\n        if index >= 0 && index < length(words)\n            # Apply the Pig Latin transformation\n            first_char = words[index][1]\n            rest_of_word = words[index][2:end]\n\n            if isvowel(first_char)  # If the first letter is a vowel, add \"way\" to the end\n                results[index] = rest_of_word * \"way\"\n            else  # If the first letter is not a vowel, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\"\n                results[index] = rest_of_word * first_char * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if a character is a vowel\nisvowel(char::Union{Char, String}))::Bool = in(lowercase(char)), ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n\n# Test the `pig_latinify` function\nwords_to_transform = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bird\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words_to_transform)\n\nprintln(\"Transformed words: $transformed_words\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `pig_latinify`, which takes a vector of strings as input. The function transforms each string to Pig Latin and stores the transformed words in a new vector.\n\nThe implementation uses multi-threading with the help of Julia's `Threads` module. Each word is transformed in a separate thread, improving the overall performance when dealing with large inputs.\n\nRemember that to run this code, you need to have Julia version 1.0 or later installed on your system.","status":200,"tokens":[0,467],"elapsed":20.807586483,"_type":"aimessage"}]
