Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) -> Vector{String}\n    result = String[]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if occursin(r\"[aeiouyAEIOUY]\", word)\n            # First letter is vowel: add \"way\" to the end\n            pig_word = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # First letter is consonant: move first consonants to the end, add \"ay\"\n            consonants = r\"^[^aeiouyAEIOUY]\"\n            match = match(consonants, word))\n            \n            if isa(match, Vector{SubString{String}}}))\n                pig_word = join(word[2:end]) * match[1] * \"ay\"\n            else\n                # If no consonants found at the beginning, treat it as a vowel case\n                pig_word = word * \"way\"\n            end\n        end\n        \n        push!(result, pig_word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\"]\nresults = pig_latinify(words)\n\nfor (original, piglated) in zip(words, results)\n    println(\"$original becomes $piglated\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will output the Pig Latin versions of each word on separate lines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":13.985677907,"_type":"aimessage"}]
