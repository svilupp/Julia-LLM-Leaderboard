[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll use Julia's threading capabilities to parallelize the processing of each string in the input vector.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\n# Implement the pig_latinify function\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if contains(vowels, first(split(word, \"?\")))) # Handle words ending with a vowel\n        return join(split(word, \"?\"), \"ay\")\n    else # Handle words ending with a consonant\n        return join(reverse(split(word, \"?\")), init=1), \"way\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Implement the parallel processing using threads\nfunction parallel_pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words)))\n    \n    # Create a new thread for each word\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(word)\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Test the function with example sentences\nwords_to_transform = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\"]\ntransformed_words = parallel_pig_latinify(words_to_transform)\n\nprintln(\"Original words: $words_to_transform\")\nprintln(\"Transformed words: $transformed_words\")\n```\n\nThis code first defines the `pig_latinify` function for converting a single word to pig latin. Then, it uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to create a separate thread for each word in the input vector. The results are collected in a new vector and returned.\n\nIn this implementation, we have assumed that the input strings do not contain any special characters or punctuation marks other than \"?\" (used as a delimiter between the consonant cluster at the beginning of a word and the rest of the word). If your input strings might contain other types of punctuation, you may need to modify the `pig_latinify` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":19.576108981,"_type":"aimessage"}]
