Here's a concise implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = similar(words) # Create an output vector with the same size as input\n    threads = 1:length(words) # Create a range for each thread\n\n    @threads for tid in threads\n        i = tid - 1 # Convert thread ID to index in words\n        if i >= 0\n            result[i] = translate_to_pig_latin(words[i]) # Replace with your pig latin translation function\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word)\n    # Implement your pig latin translation logic here\n    # This is just a placeholder, replace it with the actual implementation\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latinify` which handles multi-threading and calls the `translate_to_pig_latin` function to perform the actual pig latin translation.\n\nRemember to replace the `translate_to_pig_latin` placeholder with your actual implementation of the pig latin transformation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":11.381077426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
