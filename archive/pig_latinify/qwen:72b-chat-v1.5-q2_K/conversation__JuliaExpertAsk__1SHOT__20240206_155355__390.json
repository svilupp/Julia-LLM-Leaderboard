Here's an implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Function to transform a single word to pig latin\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if any(x -> x in vowels, word[1:2]))\n        return join([word[2:end]], word[1]]), false\n    else\n        last_vowel_index = findlast(vowels, word)\n        return join([word[last_vowel_index+1:end]],\n                          word[1:last_vowel_index-1],\n                          word[last_vowel_index]]),\n                   last_vowel_index != length(word)\n    end\nend\n\n# Function to transform a vector of strings to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n        words = split(string)\n        transformed_words = String[]\n        \n        for word in words\n            transformation_result, is_ungrouped =\n                pig_latin_word(word)\n            \n            if is_ungrouped\n                push!(transformed_words, transformation_result)\n            else\n                push!(transformed_words, join(transformation_result, \"\"))\n            end\n        end\n        \n        results[i] = join(transformed_words)\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latin_word` for transforming a single word to pig latin, and `pig_latinify` for applying the transformation to a vector of strings. The parallelism is achieved using the `Threads.@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[88,373],"elapsed":16.933583407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
