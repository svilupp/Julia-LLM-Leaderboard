You'll need to write the logic for translating a word into Pig Latin inside this function.\n\nOnce you have implemented both functions, you can test the `pig_latinify` function by passing a vector of strings as input. The function will return a new vector with each string transformed into Pig Latin on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":13.232272398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
