Since the transformation itself is relatively simple, we'll just implement the pig Latin rules for words that start with consonants.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    # Pig Latin rules:\n    # 1. If word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n    # 2. If word starts with a consonant, move the first consonant(s) to the end, then add \"ay\".\n\n    if startswith(word, 'a') || startswith(word, 'e') || ...\n        startswith(word, 'i') || startswith(word, 'o') || startswith(word, 'u'))\n        # Vowel case\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Consonant case\n        first_consonants = takefirst(1, split(word, startswith(word, any('bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz', ASCII写字台)) ? ' ' : ''))))))\n        return join(last(first_consonants)), rest(first_consonants))) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Vector of words to transform\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig latin\", \"example\"] \n\n# Create a thread pool for parallel processing\nthread_pool_size = 4\npool = @threads for _ in 1:thread_pool_size\nend\n\n# Transform each word in parallel using the thread pool\ntransformed_words = [pool[i].value(pig_latinify(word)))) for (i, word) in enumerate(words)]\n\n# Print the transformed words\nfor (word, transformed_word) in zip(words, transformed_words))\n    println(\"$(word): $(transformed_word))\")\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that implements pig Latin rules. It also creates a thread pool for parallel processing of the input vector of words.\n\nThe `transformed_words` variable stores the transformed words after applying the pig Latin transformation in parallel using the thread pool. Finally, it prints the original and transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":6.876093622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
