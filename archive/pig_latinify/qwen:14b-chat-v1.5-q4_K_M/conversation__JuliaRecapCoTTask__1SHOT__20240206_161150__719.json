[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll use Julia's `Threads` library to parallelize the transformations across separate threads.\n\nHere's the Julia code that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Anonymous function for pig Latin transformation\n    transform_to_pig_latin = (word) -> \n        if startswith(word, \"aeiou\"))\n            return word*\"ay\"\n        else\n            return popfirst!(word)*\"way\"\n        end\n\n    @sync begin\n        for input_string in input\n            # Create a separate thread for each string transformation\n            push!(results, Threads.Condition())\n            Threads.@async begin\n                transform_result = transform_to_pig_latin(input_string)\n                condition = results[end]\n                lock(condition)\n                condition通知(condition) = true\n                unlock(condition)\n                condition.notify()\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect the transformed strings\n    results = [fetch(condition)) for condition in results]\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNow you have a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings, performs pig Latin transformations on each string in parallel using separate threads, and returns the transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":4.551787209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
