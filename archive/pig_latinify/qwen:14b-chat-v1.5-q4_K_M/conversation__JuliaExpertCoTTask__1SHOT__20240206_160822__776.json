Then, we'll use Julia's `Threads` package to iterate over the input strings in separate threads.\n\nHere's the code:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    if startswith(word, \"aeiou\"))\n        return string(\"way\", dropfirst(lowercase(word)))))\n    else\n        return string(dropfirst(lowercase(word)))),\n                  \"way\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    transformed_strings = Vector{Pair{String, String},}}()\n    \n    for (index, word) in enumerate(strings)\n        thread_id = Threads.Atomic{Int}(0))\n        @async begin\n            global thread_id\n            thread_id[] += 1\n            \n            transformed_word, prefix = pig_latinify_word(word)\n            transformed_strings[index] = (transformed_word, prefix), thread_id[]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_strings\nend\n\n# Test the function\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes in a vector of strings. It uses Julia's `Threads` package to convert each word into pig latin in separate threads.\n\nThe test case provided should return the expected pig-latin transformed strings for each input word.\n:\n:","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":4.761196247,"_type":"aimessage"}]
