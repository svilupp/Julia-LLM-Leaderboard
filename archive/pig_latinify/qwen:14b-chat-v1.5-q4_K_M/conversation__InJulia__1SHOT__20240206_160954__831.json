Here's how you can implement the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        # Split string into words and convert each word to pig latin\n        pig_latin_words = map(word -> pig_latinize_word(word), length(word)), split(s, ' '))\n        \n        # Reconstruct the pig latinized string\n        pig_latin_string = join(pig_latin_words, ' ') * \"ay\"\n        \n        # Replace the original string with the pig latinized one in the input vector\n        strings[i] = pig_latin_string\n    end\n    \n    return strings\nend\n\n# Helper function to convert a word to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinize_word(word)\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    \n    if occursin(vowels, word))\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a helper function `pig_latinize_word` to convert individual words to pig latin. The main `pig_latinify` function iterates over the input vector and applies the pig latinization process on each string in parallel threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":4.630440128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
