Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Words\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @threads for string in strings\n        # Split the string into words\n        words = splitwords(string)\n\n        # Perform pig latin transformation on each word\n        pig_latin_words = map(word -> convert_word_to_pig_latin(word), word), words)\n\n        # Join the pig latin words back into a single string\n        pig_latin_string = join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n\n        # Print or return the pig latin transformed string\n        println(\"Pig Latin: $pig_latin_string\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Julia\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input. It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the transformation process for each string.\n\nNote: The `convert_word_to_pig_latin` function is not defined in this example. You would need to implement that function separately, which typically involves moving the first letter to the end and adding \"ay\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":4.329171793,"_type":"aimessage"}]
