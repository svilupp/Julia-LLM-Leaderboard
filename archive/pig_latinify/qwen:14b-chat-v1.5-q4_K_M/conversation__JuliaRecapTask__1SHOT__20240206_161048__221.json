[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll use Julia's `Threads` library to apply the pig Latin converter to each string in parallel.\n\nLet's start with the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(word)\n    # Conventional rule: If word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" and the remaining letters.\n    # If starts with consonant, move first letter to end, append \"ay\"\n    vowels = (\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\")\n    \n    if occursin(uppercasefirst(v), vowels))\n        return *(word[2:end])*\"way\", word[1])\n    else\n        return *(word[1:end-1]])*\"ay\", word[end]\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `pig_latinify` function that uses multiple threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings)))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        results[i] = convert_to_pig_latin(strings[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input, and returns a vector of pig Latin translations. The conversion is performed concurrently using multiple threads provided by the `Threads` library in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":4.921642302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
