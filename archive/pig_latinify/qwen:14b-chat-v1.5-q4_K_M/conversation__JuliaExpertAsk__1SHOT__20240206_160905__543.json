It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, we'll use Julia's built-in concurrency features, specifically `Threads`. Here's the `pig_latinify` function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    threads = Array{Thread}(undef, length(strings)))\n\n    for (i, s) in enumerate(strings)\n        new_thread = @async begin\n            pig_latin_string = latinize_word(s)\n            push!(strings[i:end], pig_latin_string))\n        end\n\n        threads[i] = new_thread\n    end\n\n    join(threads)\n\n    return strings\nend\n\nfunction latinize_word(word)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if occursin(uppercase.(vowels)), word)\n        word = word[2:end]\n    end\n    \n    return \"$(word)yay\"\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a separate thread for each string in the input vector. The `latinize_word` function handles the conversion of words to pig latin.\n\nPlease note that this implementation may not be optimal in all scenarios, but it should meet your requirements as stated.","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":3.787595498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
