[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll use Julia's `Threads` library to apply the conversion function to each string in parallel.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Create a function for converting a single string to pig latin.\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word)\n    # Remove any leading vowels and add \"way\" to end\n    if startswith(word, 'a') || startswith(word, 'e')...) || startswith(word, 'i')...)\n        return word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Move first consonant cluster to end, then add \"ay\"\n        for (index, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if !isalpha(char)\n                break\n            end\n        end\n        return word[index+1:end] * word[1:index+1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n1. Use `Threads` to parallelize the pig latin conversion for each string.\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(vector::Vector{AbstractString}})\n    # Initialize empty vector to store pig-latinized strings\n    pig_latin_vector = Vector{AbstractString}()\n\n    # Create a thread pool with as many threads as there are elements in the input vector\n    num_threads = length(vector)\n    @sync begin\n        for i in 1:num_threads\n            # Launch a new thread to process each string in parallel\n            @async begin\n                string_to_convert = vector[i]\n                pig_latin_string = to_pig_latin(string_to_convert)\n                push!(pig_latin_vector, pig_latin_string)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_vector\nend\n```\nNow you have a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings, converts each string to pig latin in parallel using Julia's `Threads` library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":6.546544262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
