It uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the processing of each string.\n\nEach iteration runs on a separate thread and performs the pig latin conversion for the given word.\n\nFinally, it prints out the results for each thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":4.72511556,"_type":"aimessage"}]
