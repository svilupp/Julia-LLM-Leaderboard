The transformations are performed in separate threads using Julia's `@threads` macro.\n\nNote: In practice, multithreading in Julia might not provide significant speedup due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, the example still demonstrates how to use threading in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":16.697500382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
