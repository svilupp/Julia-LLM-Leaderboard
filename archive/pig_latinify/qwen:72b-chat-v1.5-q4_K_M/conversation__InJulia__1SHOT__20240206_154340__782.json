First, make sure you have the latest version of Julia installed.\n\nHere's how to implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(words)  # Create a new array with the same size as input\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # If the first letter is uppercase, preserve it\n            result[i] = uppercase(pig_latinify([word])[1]))\n        else\n            result[i] = pig_latinify([word])[1])\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    \n    if in(word[1], vowels)  # If the first letter is a vowel, add 'way' to the end\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else  # If the first letter is a consonant, move all the leading consonants to the end and add 'ay'\n        lead_consonants = \"\"\n        for char in word\n            if !in(char, vowels) && !isspace(char)\n                lead_consonants *= char\n            else\n                break\n            end\n        end\n\n        return word[findfirst(vowels, word)):end] * lead_consonants * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"uliahJway\", \"s_MAY\", \"wesomeAY\"]\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `pig_latinify` for operating on a vector of strings, and an inner `pig_latinify` function that handles the transformation of individual words.\n\nThe outer `pig_latinify` function utilizes Julia's Threads package to parallelize the processing of each word in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":25.877761075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
