It creates an output vector and uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each string in a separate thread.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_single` function is responsible for converting a single string into Pig Latin. It checks if the first letter is a vowel or not, and then constructs the Pig Latin word accordingly.\n\nFinally, we test the `pig_latinify` function with an example input vector and print the transformed words in Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":20.692697186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
