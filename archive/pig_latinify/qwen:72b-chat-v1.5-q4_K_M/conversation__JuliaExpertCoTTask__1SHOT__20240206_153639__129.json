The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, iterates over each string in a separate thread using the `@threads` macro, and returns a filtered vector of resulting pig latin words.\n\nThe provided test case is executed at the end to showcase the functionality of the implemented functions.","status":200,"tokens":[177,416],"elapsed":36.807569542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
