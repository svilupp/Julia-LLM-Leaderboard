However, note that I/O tasks like printing or transforming text may not benefit significantly from threading due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in some languages.\n\nAssuming we don't have a GIL in Julia, here's how you could implement a pig latin transformer:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    \n    # If the word starts with a vowel\n    if startswith(word, vowels)\n        return \"$(word)ay\"\n    else\n        # Find the index of the first vowel\n        first_vowel_idx = findfirst(isequal-any(vowels), word))\n        \n        # If there's no vowel, just add \"way\" at the end\n        if isnothing(first_vowel_idx)\n            return \"$(word)way\"\n        else\n            # Move the consonants before the first vowel to the end\n            new_word = join(word[first_vowel_idx:end]], \"\")\n            \n            # Add the original consonants and the appropriate suffix\n            return \"$(new_word)$(word[1:first_vowel_idx-1])ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        result = pig_latinify(word)\n        println-threading(\"$(Dates.format(now(), \"HH:MM:SS\"))) - $(word) -> $(result)\")\n    end\nend\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a single word and transforms it into pig latin. The main function, `main()`, creates a vector of words and then iterates over them in parallel using the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n\nEach iteration prints the original word, the transformed result, and the current time for tracking purposes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":23.195496771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
