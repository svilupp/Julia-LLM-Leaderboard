[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Check if the first letter is uppercase.\n2. If not uppercase, set the prefix to an empty string and keep the original word as the stem.\n3. If the first letter is uppercase, copy it to the prefix, convert the rest of the word to lowercase, and use that as the stem.\n4. Remove the first letter from the stem and append \"ay\" to create the transformed word.\n5. Save the transformed word in the result vector.\n\nThe function makes use of Julia's multithreading capabilities with the `@threads` macro, which allows for parallel execution of the transformation process for each string in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[8,316],"elapsed":18.518242781,"_type":"aimessage"}]
