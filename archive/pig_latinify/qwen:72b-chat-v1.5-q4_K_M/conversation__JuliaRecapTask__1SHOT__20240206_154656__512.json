[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we'll create the main function which will iterate over each string in the input vector and apply the pig latin transformation on separate threads.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\n# Helper function to convert a single word to pig latin\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if any(isequal, vowels), findfirst(vowels, word)] != 1\n        # Non-vowel starts the word, move initial consonants to end\n        consonants = filter(!isequal, vowels), word)\n        return join(consonants[2:end]), \"\") * consonants[1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Vowel starts the word, add \"way\" or \"ay\"\n        return word * (word[end] == 'y' ? \"way\" : \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to convert a vector of strings to pig latin on separate threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words)))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word(word)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use the `pig_latinify` function to transform a vector of strings into pig latin on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":18.177241791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
