It creates a similar result array, and then processes each input string in parallel using Julia's threading capabilities.\n\nFor each word, the function checks if the first character is a letter. If not, it leaves the word unchanged in the result array.\n\nIf the first character is a letter, the function scans the rest of the word to find the index of the first vowel. If no vowels are found after the first letter, the word is transformed by appending the initial letter to the end of the remaining letters.\n\nIf a vowel is found, the transformation involves appending the initial consonant cluster (i.e., the initial letter up to but not including the first vowel) to the end of the remaining letters.\n\nThe function returns the result array containing the pig latin versions of the input words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":18.62531193,"_type":"aimessage"}]
