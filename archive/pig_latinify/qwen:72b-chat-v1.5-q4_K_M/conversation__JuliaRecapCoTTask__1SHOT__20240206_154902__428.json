[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given no special instructions, I will assume the standard rules for Pig Latin:\n\n1. If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"way\" to the end.\n2. If the word starts with a consonant cluster (two or more consecutive consonants), move that cluster to the end and add \"ay\".\n3. If the word starts with a single consonant, follow rule 2 but only move one consonant.\n\nHere's the implementation of `pig_latinify` using Julia's threading capabilities:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words)))\n    \n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if occursin(r\"^[aeiou]\", word)\n            results[i] = string(word, \"way\")\n        else\n            first_consonant = findfirst(âˆ‰(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])), word)\n            cluster = word[1:first_consonant-1]\n            results[i] = string(word[first_consonant:end], cluster, \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation should take a vector of strings as input and return the corresponding Pig Latin versions in a new vector. Each transformation is executed on a separate thread using Julia's `@threads` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":17.232225606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
