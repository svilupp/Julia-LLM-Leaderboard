[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The special instructions are empty, so we'll proceed with the standard task.\n\nTo implement `pig_latinify`, we first need to define a function for converting an individual word to pig latin. After that, we'll use Julia's threading capabilities (`@threads`) to run each string conversion on a separate thread.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = Set{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\n    \n    if startswith(lowercase(word), collect(vowels)))\n        return \"$(word[2:end])ay\"\n    else\n        first_consonants = lowercase(replace(word, r\"^[aeiou]$\" => \"\")))\n        return \"$first_consonantsay$(word[first_consonants.length+1:end])\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this code by calling `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings. Each string will be transformed into pig latin, and the results will be returned as a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":15.999491957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
