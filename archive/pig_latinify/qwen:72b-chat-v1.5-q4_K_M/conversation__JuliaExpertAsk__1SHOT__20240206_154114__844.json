It then creates separate threads for each string and applies the pig latin transformation on each thread.\n\nAfter all threads have finished, the function returns a vector of the transformed strings.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `pig_latinify` function with a sample input vector and prints the original and transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":21.363861487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
