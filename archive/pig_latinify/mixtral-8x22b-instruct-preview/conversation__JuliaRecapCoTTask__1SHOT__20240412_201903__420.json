[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If true, it returns the original word (in pig latin there are no changes for words starting with vowels).\nIf it doesn't, the first consonant is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended. Additionally, the casing of the first letter is maintained.\nThe function makes use of multiple dispatch.\n\nUsage: `pig_latinify(\"apple\")` returns \"appleay\", `pig_latinify(\"tomato\")` returns \"omatotay\", and `pig_latinify(\"Apple\")` returns \"Appleay\".\n\n#Julia snippet used","status":200,"tokens":[379,200],"elapsed":3.541356667,"cost":0.0005211,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":810536203,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
