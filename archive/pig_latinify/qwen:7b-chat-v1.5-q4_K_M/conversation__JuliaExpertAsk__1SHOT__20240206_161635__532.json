The code creates separate threads for each word and applies the Pig Latin rules in each thread. The synchronization is done using a mutex to ensure thread safety.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there are enough CPU cores available to create multiple threads without causing overloading or other issues.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":5.271562412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
