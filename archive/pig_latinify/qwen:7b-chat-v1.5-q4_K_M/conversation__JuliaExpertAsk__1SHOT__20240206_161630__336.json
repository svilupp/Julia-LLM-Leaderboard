First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. In this case, we'll use the built-in `Threads` and `String` modules.\n\n2. Define the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings as input.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    Threads.nthreads()\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    Threads.eachthread do |tid|\n        for str in strs\n            # Your pig Latin transformation logic goes here\n            latin_str = ...  # Implement the conversion\n\n            push!(results, latin_str * \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n3. Replace `...` with the actual logic to convert each string to Pig Latin.\n\n4. Now you can use this function by passing a vector of strings as an argument.\n\n```julia\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(strs)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a separate thread for each input string, which should result in efficient parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":2.55911306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
