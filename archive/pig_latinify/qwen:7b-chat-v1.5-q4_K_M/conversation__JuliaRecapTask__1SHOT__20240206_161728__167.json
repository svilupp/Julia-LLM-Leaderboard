[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of their Pig Latin forms.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Function to convert a word to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    # Handle special cases (like words starting with 'i' or 'a')\n    if endswith(word, \"i\"))\n        return word[1:end-1] + \"way\"\n    elseif beginswith(word, \"a\"))\n        return word[2:] + \"igh\"\n    else\n        # Regular case: move consonants to the end and add 'ay'\n        firstletter = first(word)\n        consonants = filter(c -> !in(\"aeiou\", c)), string(firstletter, word[2:end])))\n        if length(consonants) > 0\n            return word[1] + \" \"$(consonants)*)\"ay\"\n        else\n            return word + \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Create a Vector{String} for storing the transformed words\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}()\n\n    # Start multi-threading\n    threads = ThreadsVector([Threads.@thread pig_latin(word) for word in str] for str in strs))\n\n    # Join and append the transformed words to the vector\n    for thread in threads\n        push!(transformed_words, thread[].value))\n    end\n\n    return transformed_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\"]\ntranslated_words = pig_latinify(strs)\nfor word in translated_words\n    println(word)\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a separate thread for each input string. The `pig_latin` function is called within each thread and updates the corresponding transformed words. Finally, all transformed words are collected and returned.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the CPU has multiple cores for multi-threading. If your system doesn't support multi-core threading, this code won't work as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":4.754371674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
