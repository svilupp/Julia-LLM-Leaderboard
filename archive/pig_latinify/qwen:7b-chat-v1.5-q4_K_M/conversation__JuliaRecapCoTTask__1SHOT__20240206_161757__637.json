[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String}, nthreads=Julia.nthreads()) :: Vector{String}\n    # Split strings into chunks for parallel processing\n    chunk_size = div(length(strings), nthreads))\n    \n    threads = []\n    for i in 1:nthreads\n        start_index = (i - 1) * chunk_size + 1\n        end_index = min(start_index + chunk_size - 1, length(strings)))\n        \n        thread = Threads.@thread pig_latinize_substring(strings[start_index:end_index]]))\n        threads << thread\n    end\n    \n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect the result\n    results = []\n    for i in 1:nthreads\n        push!(results, fetch(threads[i])) .# Replace with proper pig latin output format\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\"]\npiggy_output = pig_latinify(strings, nthreads=4))\nprintln(piggy_output)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that processes a vector of strings in parallel using multiple threads. The function splits the input into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate thread for processing.\n\nMake sure to adjust the number of threads (`nthreads`) based on your system's capabilities. Also, note that the pig Latin output is not properly formatted in this example, replace `. ..` with the actual pig Latin output.","status":200,"tokens":[8,337],"elapsed":3.619331204,"_type":"aimessage"}]
