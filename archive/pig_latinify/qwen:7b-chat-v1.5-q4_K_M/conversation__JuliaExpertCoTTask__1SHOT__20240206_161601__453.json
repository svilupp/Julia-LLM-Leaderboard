It also creates a thread-based `transform_string` function to apply the transformation to each word in a vector.\n\nThe code then demonstrates the usage by providing a vector and transforming it using the `pig_latinify_vector` function. The transformed vector is printed at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.929502409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
