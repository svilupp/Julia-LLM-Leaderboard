It then creates multiple threads to process the string vectors in parallel. The converted strings are collected back into a single result.\n\nThe given task and data example is used to demonstrate the usage of the `pig_latinify_vector` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.368513286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
