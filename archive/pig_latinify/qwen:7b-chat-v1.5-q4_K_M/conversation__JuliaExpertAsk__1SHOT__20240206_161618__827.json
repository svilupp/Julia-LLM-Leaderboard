It uses `Threads` and a thread pool to process these tasks concurrently.\n\nThe `convert_to_pig_latin` function is responsible for converting a single string to pig Latin. It handles different cases based on the presence of vowels in the consonant cluster.","status":200,"tokens":[0,349],"elapsed":3.614227081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
