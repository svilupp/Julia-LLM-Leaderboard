Each task is a separate `pig_to_pig` thread that converts a given word to Pig Latin.\n\nThe main thread waits for all tasks to finish by dequeuing them from the queue and joining their threads. The translated words are then returned as a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,363],"elapsed":3.757320486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
