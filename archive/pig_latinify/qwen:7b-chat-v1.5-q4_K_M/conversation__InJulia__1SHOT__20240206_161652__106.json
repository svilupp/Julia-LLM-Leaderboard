Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    n_threads = max(1, Threads.nthreads()))\n    \n    # Split the string into words\n    words = split.(strs, \" \")\n\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    threads = Vector{Thread}()\n    \n    # Create worker threads for each word\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        thread_id = i % n_threads\n        thread = Threads.@thread pig_latinify_word(word)\n        \n        push!(threads, thread)\n        push!(results, thread_id => thread.return_value))\n    end\n    \n    # Wait for all worker threads to finish\n    for thread in threads\n        @sync begin\n            wait(thread)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\n# Pig Latinify a single word\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word)\n    if endswith(word, \"y\") && !endsWith(word, \"ey\"))\n        return word[1:end-1] + \"ay\"\n    elseif endswith(word, \"ie\"))\n        return word[1:end-2] + \"ee\"\n    else\n        return word + \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\"]\nresults = pig_latinify(strs)\nprintln(results)  # Output: Dict{Int64, Any}, Dict{Int64, Any}, ...\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings. It uses the `Threads.@thread` macro to create worker threads for each word in the input strings.\n\nThe `results` dictionary returned by `pig_latinify` contains the transformed words for each original string, along with their thread IDs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":4.280562939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
