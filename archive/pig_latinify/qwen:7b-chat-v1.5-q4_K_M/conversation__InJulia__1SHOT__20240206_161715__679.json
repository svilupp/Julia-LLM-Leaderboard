Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Pig Latin transformation rules\nfunction pig_latinify(str)\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = split(str, ' ')\n\n    # Function to transform a word to pig Latin\n    function transform_word(word)\n        if endswith(word, 'y') && !isletterlast(word)\n            return word * 'ay'\n        elseif isletterword(word) || occursin('aeiou', word)\n            return word * 'o' # Add 'o' to the end of a consonant or vowel\n        else\n            error(\"Invalid character in $word\") # Handle non-letter characters\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Transform each word and concatenate them\n    transformed_words = map(transform_word, words))\n    return join(transformed_words, ' '))\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\"]\ntranslated_strings = @threads $(map(pig_latinify, strings)), wait=true)\nprintln(translated_strings)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings and uses parallel threads to transform each string. The rules for transforming words to pig Latin are included in the `transform_word` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":3.02833086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
