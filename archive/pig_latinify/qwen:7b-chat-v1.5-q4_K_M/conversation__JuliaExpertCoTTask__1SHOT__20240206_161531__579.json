It creates a thread pool based on the number of available cores. Then, it divides the strings into chunks and assigns each chunk to a separate worker thread. The workers transform the chunks to pig Latin using the provided transformation function (`pig_latin_transform`). After all threads complete, the results are gathered and returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `pig_latinify` function with the given data.","status":200,"tokens":[177,497],"elapsed":8.359744038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
