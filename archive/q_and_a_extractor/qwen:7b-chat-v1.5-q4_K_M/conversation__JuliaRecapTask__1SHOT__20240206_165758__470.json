[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the input markdown text `md`.\n2. Find the Question and Answer sections by searching for lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the question and answer from each section.\n4. Remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n5. Return the answer as a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Step 1: Parse markdown\n    parsed_md = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Step 2: Find Question and Answer sections\n    question_sections = findall(r\"^# Question\", parsed_md))\n    answer_sections = findall(r\"^# Answer\", parsed_md))\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the questions and answers\n    questions = []\n    for section in question_sections\n        line = parsed_md[section]\n        questions.append(String(line)[2:end]))  # Remove leading hash character\n    end\n\n    answers = []\n    for section in answer_sections\n        line = parsed_md[section]\n        answers.append(String(line)[2:end])))  # Remove leading hash character\n    end\n\n    # Step 4: Remove leading spaces and newlines\n    questions = join(questions, \" \"), \"\\n\")\n    answers = join(answers, \" \", \"\\n\"), \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Return the answer as a tuple\n    return (questions, answers))\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use this function to extract the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":3.547705028,"_type":"aimessage"}]
