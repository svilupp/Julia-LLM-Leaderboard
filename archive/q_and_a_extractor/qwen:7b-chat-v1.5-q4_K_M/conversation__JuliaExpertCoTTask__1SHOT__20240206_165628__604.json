Import necessary libraries for string manipulation.\n2. Define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text as input.\n3. Inside the function, use regex or other string parsing methods to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n4. For each found section, extract the question by removing any leading spaces and newlines, and then the answer in a similar manner.\n5. After extracting both the question and answer for all found sections, return them as a tuple.\n\nNow, let's write the code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Find Question and Answer sections\n    questions_pattern = r\"^\\s*# Question\\s*$\"\n    answers_pattern = r\"^\\s*# Answer\\s*$\"\n\n    questions_matches = re.findall(questions_pattern, md), flags=re.MULTILINE)\n    answers_matches = re.findall(answers_pattern, md), flags=re.MULTILINE)\n\n    # Extract question and answer from matched sections\n    q_and_a_list = []\n    for question_match in questions_matches:\n        question = question_match.strip()\n        q_and_a_list.append((question, None)))\n\n    for answer_match in answers_matches:\n        answer_start = answer_match.start(0)\n        if q_and_a_list:  # If there's already a question extracted\n            previous_q_and_a = q_and_a_list[-1]\n            previous_question = previous_q_and_a[0]  # Get the previous question\n            if answer_start < len(previous_question):  # Check if this is a continuation of the previous question\n                q_and_a_list[-1][1]] = previous_q_and_a[1] + answer_match.group()  # Append the answer to the previous one\n                break  # Skip processing this answer, as it's part of a larger question\n\n        answer = answer_match.group().strip()\n        q_and_a_list.append((previous_question or \"\", answer)))\n\n    return tuple(q_and_a_list)\n\n# Test case\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")\nprint(result)  # Output: ((None, 'What is the capital of France?')), (('', 'Paris.')), (('', ''))))\n```\n\nThis code defines a `q_and_a_extractor` function that takes a markdown-formatted text as input and returns a tuple containing the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,537],"elapsed":5.635448942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
