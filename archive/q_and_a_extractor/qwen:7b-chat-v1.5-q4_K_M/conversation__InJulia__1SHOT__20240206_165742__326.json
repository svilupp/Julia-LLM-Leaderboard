Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

For example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer 1\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question 2\nHow does a computer process data?\n\n# Answer 2\nA computer processes data using its Central Processing Unit (CPU).\n\"\"\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(question)\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(answer)\")\n```\n\nThis will output the extracted question and answer for both sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":3.191708017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
