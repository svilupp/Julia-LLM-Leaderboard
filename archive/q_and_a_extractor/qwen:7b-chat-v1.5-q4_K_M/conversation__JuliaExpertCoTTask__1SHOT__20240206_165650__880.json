Import the necessary functions for string manipulation.\n2. Define the function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n3. Inside the function, use regular expressions to find the start of the Question and Answer sections.\n4. Once the sections are found, extract the question and answer by splitting on the newline character `\\n` and removing leading spaces.\n5. Return the extracted question and answer in a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md_text):\n    # Find the start of Question section\n    question_start = re.search(r\"# Question\\n\", md_text, flags=re.IGNORECASE), md_text)\n    \n    # If no Question section found, return None\n    if question_start is None:\n        return None\n    \n    # Find the end of Answer section (inclusive)\n    answer_end = re.search(r\"(# Answer|\\n)+$\", md_text[question_start.end():], flags=re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE), md_text)\n\n    # If no Answer section found, extract the Question\n    if answer_end is None:\n        return (md_text[:question_start.end()]], md_text[:question_start.end()]))\n\n    # Extract the question and answer\n    question = md_text[question_start.end():answer_end.start()] + answer_end.group()\n    answer = md_text[answer_end.end():]\n\n    # Remove leading spaces from both question and answer\n    question = re.sub(r\"^\\s*\", \"\", question)\n    answer = re.sub(r\"^\\s*\", \"\", answer)\n\n    return (question, answer))\n\n# Test the function with given data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\nprint(result)  # Output: (('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.'), ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')))\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text as input and extracts the question and answer from the sections marked with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It returns a tuple containing both the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":4.928242381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
