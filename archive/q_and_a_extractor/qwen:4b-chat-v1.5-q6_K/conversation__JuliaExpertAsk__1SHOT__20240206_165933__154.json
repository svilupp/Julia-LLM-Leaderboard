Extract all text in markdown sections Question and Answer\n   * Use regular expression pattern `text_pattern`\n   * Search for the pattern within the markdown-formatted string `md`\n   * If the pattern is found, extract all text within the corresponding markdown-section using a list comprehension to create an empty list. Then, iterate over each match of the pattern in the Markdown-formatted string `md`. For each match, append the extracted text to the empty list created in the previous step. Finally, return the contents of the list, which should be an empty list since no text was extracted from the Markdown-formatted string `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":4.067827706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
