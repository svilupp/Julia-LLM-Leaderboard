It then extracts the question and answer sections from each section in turn. Finally, it combines all of these sections into a single string, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and returns the answer tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each question and answer pair is contained within a separate section starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, respectively. It also assumes that any leading spaces and newlines in the extracted text should be stripped before returning the answer tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.135975947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
