Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

We can then strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's some sample code that should do the trick:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract question and answer sections\n    sections = md.split(\"\\n\\n\") # split markdown on 2 newline chars\n\n    # Extract question and answer sections\n    answers = []\n    for section in sections\n        if section.start_with(\"# Question\")) # start with # Question\n            answers.append(section[7:end]]) # extract question from section\n            break # exit loop after extracting question\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Extract answer text\n    answer_text = \"\"\n    for section in sections\n        if section.start_with(\"# Answer\")) # start with # Answer\n            answer_text += \"\\n\" + section[7:end]]) # extract answer from section\n            break # exit loop after extracting answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (answers, answer_text))\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes as input a markdown-formatted string `md`. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is an array of strings representing each question in the markdown-formatted text `md`. The second element is an array of strings representing each answer in the markdown-formatted text `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.808966252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
