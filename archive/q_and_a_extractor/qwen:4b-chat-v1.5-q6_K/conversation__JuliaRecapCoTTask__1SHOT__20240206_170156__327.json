[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we need to extract the text that is formatted as a Question and Answer pair. We can achieve this by using regular expressions to match the specific formatting of a Question and Answer pair. Once we have extracted the relevant text, we can simply split the string into two parts at the point where the Q&A pair formatting ends. Finally, we can simply return the second part of the string as our answer tuple.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract text that starts with \"#Question\"\n    question_text = md[md.starts_with(\"#Question\")].strip(\" \")\n    \n    # Extract text that starts with \"#Answer\"\n    answer_text = md[md.starts_with(\"#Answer\")]].strip(\" \")\n    \n    # Split the extracted text into two parts at the point where the Q&A pair formatting ends\n    question_and_answer_text = [question_text,answer_text)]\n    \n    return question_and_answer_text\n    \nend\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
