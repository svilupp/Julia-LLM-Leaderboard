[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The extracted text is then returned as a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":1.546046803,"_type":"aimessage"}]
