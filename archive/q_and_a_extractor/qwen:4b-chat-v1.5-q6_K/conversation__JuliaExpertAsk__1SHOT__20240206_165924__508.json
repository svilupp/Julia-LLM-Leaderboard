It then checks each section to see if it starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a section matches one of these two patterns, that section is considered a \"question and answer\" (Q&A) section.\n\nFor each Q&A section found in the input markdown text, this implementation extracts the question and answer from those sections and stores them as separate tuples. The extracted question and answer are then returned from this function in a single tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n\nFinally, before returning the extracted question and answer tuple from this function, it removes any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text stored as the second element of the returned tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[118,252],"elapsed":2.422262441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
