This allows the function to correctly identify and extract all relevant information from the markdown text.\nNext, the function extracts all markdown sections starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'. This allows the function to correctly identify and extract all relevant information from the markdown text.\nFinally, the function iterates through each question_answer_section in the list. For each section, the function checks if the current markdown section starts with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If it does, then the function extracts and stores the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Finally, the function returns the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\nI hope this explanation of how the `q_ands_a_extractor` function works helps you understand its purpose and how to use it effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":4.551153888,"_type":"aimessage"}]
