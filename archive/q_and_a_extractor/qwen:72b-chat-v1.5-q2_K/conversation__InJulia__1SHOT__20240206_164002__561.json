Then it iterates through each line to identify lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. The function strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question and answer texts.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple of tuples `(question,answer)`, where each inner tuple represents a single question-answer pair found in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[90,213],"elapsed":9.734783313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
