X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We'll then strip any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Parse the markdown text to find lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text from these lines, removing any leading spaces or newlines.\n3. Combine the question and answer texts into a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia code.\n\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    # Parse markdown to find Question and Answer sections\n    for line in eachline(String(md)))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[8:end], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\")\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[8:end], r\"^\\s*\" => \"\")\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Combine question and answer texts into a tuple\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` takes the markdown-formatted text `md` as input, extracts the Question and Answer sections, and returns a collection of tuples `(question,answer)`.\n\nTo test this function, you can provide markdown text with Question and Answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[357,298],"elapsed":13.959615794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
