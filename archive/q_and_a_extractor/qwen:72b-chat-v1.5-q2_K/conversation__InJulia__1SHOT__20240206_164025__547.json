Then it iterates over each line in the markdown content, matching the patterns to extract the questions and answers.\n\nThe extracted questions and answers are stored in separate arrays, and then they're returned as a tuple of tuples `(question,answer),(question,answer),...`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":10.479192588,"_type":"aimessage"}]
