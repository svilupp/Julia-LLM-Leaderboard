[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement, I will write a function that extracts the question and answer sections from the provided markdown input.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = lstrip(line)  # Remove leading spaces\n\n        if startswith(stripped_line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(stripped_line[9:end])))\n\n        elseif startswith(stripped_line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(stripped_line[8:end])))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers))\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` first initializes empty arrays for questions and answers. It then splits the markdown input into lines and iterates over each line.\n\nFor each line, it removes leading spaces using `lstrip`. If the stripped line starts with `# Question`, it extracts the question text and adds it to the `questions` array. Similarly, if the stripped line starts with `# Answer`, it adds the answer text to the `answers` array.\n\nFinally, after iterating over all lines, the function returns a tuple of `(question,answer)` pairs using the `zip` function.\n\nNow you can use the `q_and_a_extractor` function on markdown-formatted text containing Question and Answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":13.538648573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
