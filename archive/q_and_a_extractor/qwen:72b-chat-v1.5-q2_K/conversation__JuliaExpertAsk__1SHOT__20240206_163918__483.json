It then iterates over these lines, checking if a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it matches either pattern, it strips leading spaces and stores the question or answer text.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":7.708076381,"_type":"aimessage"}]
