[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's an outline of how I would approach it:\n\n1. Parse the markdown text line by line.\n2. When encountering a `# Question` header, start collecting lines until another `# Answer` header is encountered.\n3. Store the collected question and answer text.\n4. Return a list of `(question,answer)` tuples.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia code.\n\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    reading_question = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            reading_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            break\n        end\n\n        if reading_question\n            push!(questions, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    answers = []\n    reading_answer = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            reading_answer = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Question\") || isempty(line)\n            break\n        end\n\n        if reading_answer\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nWe have now defined a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes markdown-formatted text and returns tuples containing the question and answer.\n\nTo test this function, we can create some sample markdown text with Question and Answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":14.556743128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
