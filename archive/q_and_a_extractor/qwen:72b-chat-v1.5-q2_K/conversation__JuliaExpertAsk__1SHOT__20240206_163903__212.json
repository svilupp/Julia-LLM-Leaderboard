We import `rsearch` from the base module for searching the last occurrence of a pattern.\n2. We define two regular expressions: one for matching the question and another for matching the answer.\n3. Using the `match` function, we find the matches for both question and answer regexes.\n4. To strip leading spaces and newlines, we use the `strip` function on each match.\n5. Finally, we return a tuple containing the stripped question and answer texts.\n\nYou can test this function with various markdown text examples to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":11.2807056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
