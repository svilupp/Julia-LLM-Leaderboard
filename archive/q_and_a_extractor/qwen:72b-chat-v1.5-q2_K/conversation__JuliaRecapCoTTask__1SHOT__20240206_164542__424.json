[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since there are no specific instructions for this task, I will proceed with the general guidelines mentioned earlier.\n\nFirst, let's define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    # Split markdown into lines\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\"))\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(line[12:end]))  # Remove \"Question: \" and leading spaces\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(line[9:end]))   # Remove \"Answer: \" and leading spaces\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Pair questions with answers and return as a tuple\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nNow the function `q_and_a_extractor` is ready to use. Given a markdown-formatted text, it will extract all Question-Answer pairs and return them in a tuple format.\n\nRemember that if there are any specific instructions for this task, those should be followed first.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":11.526491385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
