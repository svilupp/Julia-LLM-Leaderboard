Here's a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(line[12:end]))\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line[10:end]))\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first initializes empty arrays for questions and answers. Then it splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over them.\n\nWhen it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it extracts the question by removing the prefix (`strip(line[12:end]))`) and adds it to the `questions` array.\n\nSimilarly, when it finds a line starting with `# Answer`, it extracts the answer, adds it to the `answers` array, and continues processing the remaining lines.\n\nFinally, the function returns an iterator over tuples `(question,answer)` by using `zip(questions, answers))`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":11.288997681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
