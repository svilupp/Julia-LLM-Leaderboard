Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we'll first parse the Markdown text to find the sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Then we'll strip the leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::Markdown.MD)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for element in md.content\n        if isa(element, MarkdownHeading) && startswith(element.text, \"Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(reshape(join(element.text[7:end]], \"\\n\")), '\\n')))\n        elseif isa(element, MarkdownCodeBlock) && startswith(element.info, \"Answer\")\n            answer_text = replace(String(element.content), r\"^\\s*\" => \"\")\n            push!(answers, strip(answer_text, '\\n')))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first parse the Markdown text into a `Markdown.MD` object. Then we iterate over each element in the content of this object.\n\nWe check if an element is a heading (`MarkdownHeading`) and its text starts with \"Question\". If so, we extract the question text, strip leading spaces and newlines, and add it to the list of questions.\n\nNext, we check if an element is a code block (`MarkdownCodeBlock`) and its `info` attribute (usually representing the language of the code) starts with \"Answer\". If this condition is met, we process the answer text similarly to the question text.\n\nFinally, we return a tuple containing pairs of questions and answers, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes well-formed Markdown input. Malformed or invalid Markdown may result in unexpected behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":16.428150357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
