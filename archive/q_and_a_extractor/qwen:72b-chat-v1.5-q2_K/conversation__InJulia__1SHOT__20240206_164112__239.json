Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

We'll first define the function `q_and_a_extractor(md)`.\n2. Parse the markdown input to extract the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. You can use regular expressions for this.\n3. Clean up the extracted question and answer text by removing leading spaces, newlines, and the `#` symbol along with any trailing whitespace.\n4. Return a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(String(md)))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line, r\"#\\s*\" => \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line, r\"#\\s*\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)))\nend\n```\n\nThis function should extract the question and answer sections from a given Markdown input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":10.797688133,"_type":"aimessage"}]
