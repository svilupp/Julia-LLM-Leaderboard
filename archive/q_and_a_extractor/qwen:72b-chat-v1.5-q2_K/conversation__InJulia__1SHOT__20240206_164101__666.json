We can define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the Question and Answer sections.\n\nHere's an implementation of the requested function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line, \"# Question \" => \"\")\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line, \"# Answer \" => \"\")\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines. It then iterates over each line to identify Question and Answer sections.\n\nWhen a Question or Answer section is found, the leading `# Question` or `# Answer` is removed using the `replace` function.\n\nFinally, the function returns an array of tuples `(question, answer)` for all Question-Answer pairs found in the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":10.524202609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
