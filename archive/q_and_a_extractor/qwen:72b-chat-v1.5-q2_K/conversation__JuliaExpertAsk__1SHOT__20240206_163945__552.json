Here's the function implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    pattern = r\"#\\s*(Question|Answer):\\s*([\\s\\S]*)\"\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md))\n        if match[2] == \"Question\"\n            push!(questions, strip(match[3])))\n        else\n            push!(answers, strip(match[3])))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return zip(questions, answers) |> collect\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines a regular expression pattern to match Question and Answer sections. It then iterates over the matches in the markdown text.\n\nFor each match, if it corresponds to a Question, the matched text is stripped of leading spaces and newlines and added to the `questions` list.\n\nIf the match corresponds to an Answer, the same process is followed but adding the result to the `answers` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns a collection of tuples `(question, answer)` by zipping the `questions` and `answers` lists.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":10.792391933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
