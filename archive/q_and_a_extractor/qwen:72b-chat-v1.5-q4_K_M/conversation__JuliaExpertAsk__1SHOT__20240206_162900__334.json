It checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If it does, the function strips any leading spaces and newlines from the line and adds it to the corresponding question or answer string.\n\nAfter processing all lines, the function returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":12.138816464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
