[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Define a helper function `extract_text_between_markers` that takes in a string and two markers. It will return the text between the two markers after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n2. Use the helper function to extract the question and answer from the markdown-formatted text.\n\nHere's the code implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_text_between_markers(text, start_marker, end_marker)\n    start_index = findfirst(isequal(start_marker), text))\n    if start_index == nothing\n        return \"\", 0\n    end\n\n    end_index = findfirst(isequal(end_marker), text[start_index:end])))\n    if end_index == nothing\n        return text[start_index:end], start_index\n    end\n\n    return strip(text[start_index+length(start_marker):end_index-1]]), start_index\nend\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question, _ = extract_text_between_markers(md, \"# Question\", \"# Answer\")\n    answer, _ = extract_text_between_markers(answer, \"# Answer\", \"\")\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call `q_and_a_extractor` with a markdown-formatted text to get the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":17.001430663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
