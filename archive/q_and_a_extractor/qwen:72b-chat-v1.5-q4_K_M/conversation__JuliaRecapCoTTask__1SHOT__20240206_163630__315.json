[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"No special instructions provided. Proceeding with the default problem-solving steps.\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - String manipulation: `strip()`, `split()`\n   - Markdown parsing: Julia has a `Markdown` module for parsing markdown text.\n   - Tuple creation: `(question, answer)`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    section = nothing\n    for line in lines\n        stripped_line = strip(line)\n\n        if occursin(r\"^# Question$\", stripped_line)\n            section = \"question\"\n        elseif occursin(r\"^# Answer$\", stripped_line)\n            section = \"answer\"\n        end\n\n        if section === \"question\" || section === \"answer\"\n            append!(section == \"question\" ? question : answer, line * '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` should correctly extract text in the markdown sections Question and Answer, stripping any leading spaces and newlines. The function returns a tuple with the question and answer strings.\n\nTo test the function, you can provide it with different markdown texts containing Question and Answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":16.771166084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
