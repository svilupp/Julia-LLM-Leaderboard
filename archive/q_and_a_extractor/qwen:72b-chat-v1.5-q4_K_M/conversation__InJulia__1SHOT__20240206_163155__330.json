Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an explanation of how to approach this task and the code for the function:\n\n1. We'll use Julia's built-in string manipulation functions.\n2. First, we'll split the markdown-formatted text into sections based on the `#` character using the `split` function with the appropriate regex pattern.\n3. Next, we'll iterate through these sections and check if they start with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If so, we'll trim leading spaces and newlines using the `lstrip` function.\n4. Finally, we'll store the Question and Answer pairs in a tuple array.\n\nHere's the code for the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    sections = split(md, r\"\\n#+\\s\", keepempty=false)\n\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for section in sections\n        trimmed_section = lstrip(section)\n\n        if startswith(trimmed_section, \"Question\")\n            push!(questions, trimmed_section[11:end]))\n        elseif startswith(trimmed_section, \"Answer\")\n            push!(answers, trimmed_section[9:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    return tuple(zip(questions, answers))...)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use the `q_and_a_extractor` function with a markdown-formatted text as an argument to extract Question and Answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":16.395149133,"_type":"aimessage"}]
