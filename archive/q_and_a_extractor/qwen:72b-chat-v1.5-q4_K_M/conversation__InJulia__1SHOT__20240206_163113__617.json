[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by parsing the markdown text using regular expressions. Here's an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n(.*?)(?=# Answer|$)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=# Question|$)\"s\n\n    question = match(question_regex, md) !== nothing ?\n                 strip(match(question_regex, md)).match[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = match(answer_regex, md) !== nothing ?\n              strip(match(answer_regex, md)).match[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses two regular expressions to extract the text in the `Question` and `Answer` sections. The extracted texts are then stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that there is only one instance of each section (i.e., `Question` and `Answer`) in the markdown text. If there can be multiple instances, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":12.98791819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
