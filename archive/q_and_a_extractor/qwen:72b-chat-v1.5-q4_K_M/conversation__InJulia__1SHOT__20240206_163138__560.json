[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use regular expressions to find the question and answer sections in the markdown-formatted text.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nusing Regular Expressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find the Question section\n    match_obj = match(r\"(?<=# Question)\\n(.*)(?=\\n# Answer)\", md)\n    \n    if !isnothing(match_obj)\n        question = strip(match_obj[2]))\n    else\n        question = \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Find the Answer section\n    match_obj = match(r\"(?<=# Answer)\\n(.*)(?=\\n$)\", md)\n\n    if !isnothing(match_obj)\n        answer = strip(match_obj[2]))\n    else\n        answer = \"\"\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first searches for the Question section using a regular expression. If found, it extracts and strips the question text.\n\nNext, the function looks for the Answer section with another regular expression. Similar to the question extraction, if an answer is found, it's extracted and stripped.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":14.725617379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
