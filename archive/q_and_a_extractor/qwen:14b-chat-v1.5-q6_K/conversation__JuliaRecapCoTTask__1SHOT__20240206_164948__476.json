[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the `md` string into an array of lines.\n2. Initialize empty variables for Question and Answer texts.\n3. Iterate through the lines of the markdown text.\n4. Check if the current line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n5. If it's a Question, append the stripped text to the `question` variable.\n6. If it's an Answer, append the stripped text to the `answer` variable.\n7. After iterating through all lines, return a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n'))\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if starts_with(line, \"# Question\"))\n            question = strip(question)\n        elseif starts_with(line, \"# Answer\"))\n            answer = strip(answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNow you can use this `q_and_a_extractor` function to extract questions and answers from the given markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":4.585255446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
