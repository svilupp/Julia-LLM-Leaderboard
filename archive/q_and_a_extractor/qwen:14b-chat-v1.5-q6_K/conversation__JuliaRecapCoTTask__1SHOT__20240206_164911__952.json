[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Extract the text between theQuestion and Answer sections, stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer in a tuple.\n\nHere's a Julia function that implements these steps:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Step 1: Parse markdown\n    lines = split(md, '\\n'))\n\n    # Step 2: Find Question and Answer sections\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    prev_line = nothing\n    for line in lines\n        if match(r'^\\s*# Answer\\s*$', line)\n            answers末尾追加(prev_line)\n            prev_line = nothing\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if match(r'^\\s*# Question\\s*$', line)\n            questions末尾追加(line)\n            prev_line = nothing\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n        line = strip(line, whitespace=true))\n        prev_line = line\n    end\n\n    # Step 4: Return question and answer tuples\n    return (questions[1], join(answers, \"\\n\"))),\nend\n```\nThis function should solve the problem as described.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":5.374332976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
