It iterates through the text to find the start and end positions of the Question and Answer sections.\n\nThe extracted question and answer texts are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines and returned in a tuple `(question,answer)`. If there's no corresponding Question for an Answer section, it still returns a tuple with an empty string for the question.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":4.749439806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
