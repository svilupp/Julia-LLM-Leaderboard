It then extracts the answer by finding the `# Answer` section, and extracting the text between them.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes a basic structure of the Markdown file with clear separation between Question and Answer sections. If your input markdown has variations or complex structures, you might need to adjust the regex patterns accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":5.894491986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
