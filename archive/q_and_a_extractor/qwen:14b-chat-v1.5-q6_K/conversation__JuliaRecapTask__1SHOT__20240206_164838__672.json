[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use regular expressions to match the start of a question or an answer section. Then, we extract the text and format it according to the instructions.\n\nHere's the Julia function implementing this approach:\n\n```julia\nimport Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions for matching Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n\\n\"\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*\\n(.*?)\\n\\n\"\n\n    # Extract all matches for both Question and Answer sections\n    questions = matchall(question_regex, md)\n    answers = matchall(answer_regex, md)\n\n    # Format the extracted text by removing leading spaces and newlines\n    cleaned_answers = map(x -> strip(x), whitespace=true), answers)\n\n    # Return a tuple containing the question and answer for each matching section\n    return zip(questions, cleaned_answers)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call the `q_and_a_extractor` function with a markdown-formatted text string as an argument. The function will return a tuple of questions and answers extracted from the markdown sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":4.701480951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
