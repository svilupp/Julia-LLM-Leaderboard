[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Read the input markdown text `md`.\n2. Define a regular expression pattern to match Question and Answer sections.\n3. Use string functions to extract and clean the question and answer texts.\n4. Return the tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nHere's the Julia function that implements this approach:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Step 2: Regular expression pattern for Question and Answer sections\n    pattern = r\"(?m)^# \\(Question\\)(.*)^# \\(Answer\\)(.*)\"\n\n    # Step 3: Extract and clean the question and answer texts\n    captures = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for match in captures\n        q_text = strip(match.captures[1]))\n        a_text = strip(match.captures[2]))\n\n        push!(questions, q_text)\n        push!(answers, a_text)\n    end\n\n    # Step 4: Return the tuple (question, answer)\n    questions_and_answers = zip(questions, answers)\n    return questions_and_answers\nend\n```\nNow you can use this function to extract question and answer pairs from a given markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":4.9744839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
