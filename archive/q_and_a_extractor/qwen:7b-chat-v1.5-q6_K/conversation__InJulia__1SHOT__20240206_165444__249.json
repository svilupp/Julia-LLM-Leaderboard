It then iterates through each line to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. When a section is found, it strips any leading spaces and newlines and appends the question or answer to their respective arrays.\n\nFinally, if there's at least one question, the function returns the answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`, joined by line breaks. If no questions are found, the function returns `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":3.634600304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
