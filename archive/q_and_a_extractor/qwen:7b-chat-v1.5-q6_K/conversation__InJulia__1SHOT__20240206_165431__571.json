Here's an implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Parse the markdown text\n    parsed_md = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Find Question and Answer sections\n    question_start_index = findfirst(x -> starts_with(string(x), \"# Question \")), Vector{HTMLNode}(parsed_md))\n    answer_start_index = findfirst(x -> starts_with(string(x), \"# Answer \")), Vector{HTMLNode}(parsed_md[question_start_index:end]))\n\n    # Extract question and answer from the parsed markdown\n    if question_start_index !== nothing && answer_start_index !== nothing\n        question_text = join(String, parsed_md[question_start_index+1:answer_start_index-1]]), \"\\n\")\n        answer_text = join(String, parsed_md[answer_start_index:end]]), \"\\n\")\n        return (question_text.strip(), answer_text.strip()))\n    else\n        return nothing  # No Question and Answer section found\n    end\nend\n```\n\nWith this function, you can extract the question and answer from a markdown-formatted text like:\n\n```markdown\n# Question\n\nHow does Julia handle arrays?\n\n# Answer\n\nJulia has built-in support for arrays, making it easy to work with collections of elements. You can create arrays using various syntaxes depending on your preference.\n```\n\nThe function will return `(question, answer)`, in this case, `(\"How does Julia handle arrays?\", \"Julia has built-in support for arrays...\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,332],"elapsed":3.969497235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
