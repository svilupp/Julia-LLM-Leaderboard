[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

In this case, `x isa Number` checks if the value of `x` is a number (integer or floating-point).\n\nSo, while assigning a value directly creates an assignment, checking with `isa` involves a different kind of relationship between the variable and its value. \"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(result)  # Output: ((What is the difference between `x = 5` and `x isa Number`?), ('In Julia, assigning a value to a variable like `x = 5` creates a binding between the variable `x` and the numerical value `5`.\n\nOn the other hand, using the `isa` keyword checks if an object belongs to a specific type.

The resulting tuple contains the question as well as the answer provided in the markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[8,721],"elapsed":8.851003726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
