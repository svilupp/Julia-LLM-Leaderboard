[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It returns the answer as a tuple containing both the question and the combined answers from both sections.\n\nThe code first splits the input markdown into sections using line breaks. Then, it iterates through these sections looking for lines starting with \"#\" indicating a Question or Answer section.\n\nInside the loop, if the current section is a \"Question\" section, the function extracts the question by stripping leading spaces and newlines. If there's already an answer tuple, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new one.\n\nSimilarly, if the section starts with \"# Answer\", the function extracts the answer and updates or creates a new answer tuple, depending on whether there was an existing answer tuple.\n\nFinally, after iterating through all sections, the function returns the question-answer tuple and the combined answers from both sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,589],"elapsed":7.175889989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
