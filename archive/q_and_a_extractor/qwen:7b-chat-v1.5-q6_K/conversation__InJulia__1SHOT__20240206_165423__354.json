It then extracts the relevant text from each match.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes there's only one question and answer section in the markdown text. If multiple sections are allowed, you would need to modify the regex patterns and logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[90,217],"elapsed":2.618910297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
