It then extracts the text between these sections and removes any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer texts. If no matching sections are found, an empty tuple is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":3.177384914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
