[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It returns the extracted question and answer in a tuple.\n\nThe function iterates through each line of the input markdown, removing leading spaces and newlines. It checks for lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", indicating the start of a section. The function then appends the text from these lines to the respective section variable.\n\nAfter iterating through all lines, the function checks if both question and answer sections have content. If they do, it returns a tuple containing the cleaned question and answer texts. Otherwise, it returns an empty tuple to indicate no Question and Answer sections were found in the input markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":5.965815884,"_type":"aimessage"}]
