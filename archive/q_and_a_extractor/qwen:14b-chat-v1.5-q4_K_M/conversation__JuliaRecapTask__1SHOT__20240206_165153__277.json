[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We'll first define a helper function to extract the content between two heading lines (`# Question` and `# Answer`). Then, we'll create the main `q_and_a_extractor` function that calls this helper and returns the tuple.\n\nHere's the code for the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Helper function to extract content between headings\n    function extract_content_between_headings(start, end)\n        start_index = findfirst(line -> occursin(start, line), md))\n        end_index = findfirst(line -> occursin(end, line), reverse(md))), 1\n        md[start_index:end_index]\n    end\n\n    # Find the Question and Answer sections in the markdown text\n    question_start = findfirst(line -> occursin(\"# Question\", line), md))\n    answer_start = findfirst(line -> occursin(\"# Answer\", line), reverse(md))), 1\n    \n    # Extract the content between the headings\n    question_content = extract_content_between_headings(\"# Question\", \"\\n\\n\")\n    answer_content = extract_content_between_headings(\"# Answer\", \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Clean up extracted text by removing leading spaces and newlines\n    question_content = stripstart(question_content, \" \")\n    question_content = stripstart(question_content, \"\\n\")\n\n    answer_content = stripstart(answer_content, \" \")\n    answer_content = stripstart(answer_content, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Return the tuple (question,answer)\n    return (strip(question_content), \"\\n\"), strip(answer_content), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function should solve the given task by extracting question and answer sections from the markdown text and returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[357,368],"elapsed":6.019251677,"_type":"aimessage"}]
