It then iterates through the lines, pushing them onto a stack as they are encountered.\n\nWhen it encounters a line that starts with \"# Question\", it pops all previous lines from the stack, concatenates them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. This process continues until an \"Answer\" section is found.\n\nOnce both sections have been extracted, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer texts, after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each \"Question\" or \"Answer\" section starts with the appropriate header line. If your input text does not follow this convention, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":4.950763964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
