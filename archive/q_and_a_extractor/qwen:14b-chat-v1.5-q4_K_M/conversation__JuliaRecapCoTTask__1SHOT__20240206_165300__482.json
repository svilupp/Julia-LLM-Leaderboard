[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It will check for lines that match the `# Question` or `# Answer` patterns.\n\nHere's the systematic approach to solving this task:\n\n1. Initialize an empty tuple to store the extracted question and answer.\n2. Split the `md` text into individual lines.\n3. Iterate through each line, checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n4. If a match is found, extract the text from the line after the header (since headers are usually followed by a blank line).\n5. Clean the extracted text by removing leading spaces and newlines.\n6. Append the cleaned question to the tuple.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the answer lines.\n8. After iterating through all lines, return the tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nLet's implement this function now.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":3.117592676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
