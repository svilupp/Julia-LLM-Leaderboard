[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Define the `q_and_a_extractor` function with input parameter `md`.\n2. Create an empty tuple `results` to store the extracted question-answer pairs.\n3. Split the input text `md` into lines using the newline character as a delimiter.\n4. Iterate through each line and perform the following actions:\n   a. Check if the line starts with `# Question`. If yes, extract the remaining text from that line up to the next section or end of the text, and store it in the `question` variable. Remove leading spaces and newlines.\n   b. After extracting the question, check if the following line starts with `# Answer`. If yes, extract the remaining text from that line up to the next section or end of the text, and store it in the `answer` variable. Remove leading spaces and newlines.\n   c. If both a) and b) are true, create a tuple `(question, answer)` and append it to the `results` tuple.\n\n5. After iterating through all lines, return the `results` tuple containing the extracted question-answer pairs.\n\nHere's the Julia function implementation based on the above steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    results = ()\n    lines = split(md, '\\n'))\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, '# Question'))\n            start_idx = findfirst(line .!= ' ') + 1\n            end_idx = length(line)\n            question = strip(line[start_idx:end_idx]])\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(lines[nextind(lines))]], '# Answer')\n            start_idx = findfirst(lines[nextind(lines))]] .!= ' ') + 1\n            end_idx = length(lines[nextind(lines))]]))\n            answer = strip(lines[nextind(lines))]][start_idx:end_idx])\n            push!(results, (question, answer)))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function will take a markdown-formatted text `md` and return a tuple containing the extracted question-answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,469],"elapsed":7.555900658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
