[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use regular expressions to match the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. Then, we'll extract the texts between these markers.\n\nHere's the Julia function implementing this approach:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Regular expression patterns for matching question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"^#{3} Question: (.+)$\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"^#{3} Answer: (.+)$\"\n\n    # Extract text between question and answer sections\n    function extract_text_between_markers(pattern, md)\n        match = matchall(pattern, md)\n        if length(match) > 0\n            return strip(match[1])\n        else\n            return \"\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Extract the questions and answers\n    question = extract_text_between_markers(question_pattern, md)\n    answer = extract_text_between_markers(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Return as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can use this function to extract Question and Answer sections from a given markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":3.628729463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
