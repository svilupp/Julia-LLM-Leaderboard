We also need to keep track of the current line length and current word. \nWe will iterate over the words, and for each word, we will check if the current line length + word length exceeds the text width. If it does, we add a new line and reset the current line length. Otherwise, we append the word to the current line. We will then assign the result to a variable and add a new line at the end of the string if it does not have one.  \n\n- Write any functions and other code you need \nfunction wrap_string(input_string::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = split(input_string)\n    \n    # Initialize variables\n    current_line = \"\"\n    current_line_length =","status":200,"tokens":[187,200],"elapsed":3.46010325,"cost":0.00034829999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":-322420665,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
