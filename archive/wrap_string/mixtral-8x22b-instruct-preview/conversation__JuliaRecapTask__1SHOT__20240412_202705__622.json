[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Considering the specific requirements of wrapping words and adding new lines for each line of text that exceeds a given maximum width, we can use the built-in `open` and `writelines` functions in Julia for good performance and readability.\n\nHere is an example function that achieves the desired behavior:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width)\n    Ns = 0\n    for text_line in open(text)\n        text_characters = split(text_line)\n        lines_accumr, num_lines = open(\"\"), 0\n        for text_word in text_characters\n            if text_width + Ns <= length(text_word)\n                writelines(lines_accumr, text_word * \"\\n","status":200,"tokens":[373,200],"elapsed":3.4457465,"cost":0.0005157,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1478551696,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
