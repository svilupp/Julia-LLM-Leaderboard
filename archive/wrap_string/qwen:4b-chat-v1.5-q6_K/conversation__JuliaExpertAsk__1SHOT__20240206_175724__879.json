This function takes two arguments: `text` and `text_width`.\nInside the `wrap_string` function, we first check if the length of `text` is greater than or equal to `text_width`. If it is, then we iterate over each word in `text`, one at a time. For each word, we add a new line to `text`. We continue iterating until all words have been processed.\nOverall, the `wrap_string` function takes a string of text as input, and outputs a new string of text that has been wrapped around the original string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.564534093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
