[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function splits the input string into individual words using the `split` function. It then iterates over each word, calculating its length using the `length` function. If the total length of all words in the current line exceeds the maximum width `text_width`, the function prints a message indicating that the text is too wide, and returns nothing. Otherwise, the function continues iterating over each word in the current line, calculating its length, and updating the total length of all words in the current line. The function continues iterating until it has iterated over every word in the input string `text`. At this point, the function has calculated the total length of all words in the input string `text`, which is stored in the variable `total_width` in the function body.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.713073642,"_type":"aimessage"}]
