Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text)\n    max_text_width = 10\n    text_widths = [textwidth(text)]]\n    lines = [\"\"]]\n\n    for i in 2:length(max_text_width)+1\n        text_widths[i] = textwidth(text_widths[i-1]]))\n    println(lines[1]])\n\n    for i in 2:length(lines)-1\n        println(\"\\n\" * lines[i]))\n        if text_widths[i] > max_text_width\n            lines[i+1]] = [\"\"]\n            lines[i] = [\"\"]\n        end\n    end\n\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses an array `text_widths` to keep track of the width of each word in the input string. It also uses an array `lines` to keep track of the current line being generated.\n\nThe implementation iterates over each word in the input string and updates the `text_widths` array accordingly. It then adds a new line character at the end of the current line by updating the `lines` array accordingly.\n\nFinally, the implementation prints out the first line of the output string by accessing the first element of the `lines` array.\n\nI hope this example implementation helps illustrate how to implement the `wrap_string` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":2.605277143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
