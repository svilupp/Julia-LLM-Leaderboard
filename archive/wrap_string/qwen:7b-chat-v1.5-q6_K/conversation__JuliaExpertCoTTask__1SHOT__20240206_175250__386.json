It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It iterates over each word in the text, checking if adding it to the current line would exceed the given `text_width`. If exceeded, a new line is started with adjusted width.\n\nThe example provided wraps words into lines up to 15 characters wide:\n\n```julia\n\"This function will wrap words into lines\" â†’ \"This function\\nwill wrap words\\nto into lines\"\n```\nYou can see that each time the line would exceed 15 characters, a new line is started.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":3.27003617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
