The function iterates over each word in the text, checking if adding it to the current line would exceed the given width. If so, a newline is added and a new line is started for the next word. Finally, the wrapped text is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.29606222,"_type":"aimessage"}]
