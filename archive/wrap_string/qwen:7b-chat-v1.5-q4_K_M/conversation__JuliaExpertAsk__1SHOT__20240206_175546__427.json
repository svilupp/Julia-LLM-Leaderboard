The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, `wrap_string` takes a string and a maximum text width as input. It splits the text into words and wraps them onto new lines when necessary. The resulting wrapped text is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":2.192184455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
