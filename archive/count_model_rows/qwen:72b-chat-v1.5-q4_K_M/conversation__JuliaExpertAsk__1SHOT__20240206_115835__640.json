The function first groups the data by the `model` column using `groupby`. Then it pipes (`|>`) the grouped data to `valmap`, which applies the `size` function to each group, counting the number of rows for each model. The result is returned as a dictionary where keys are models and values are row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,127],"elapsed":7.260087406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
