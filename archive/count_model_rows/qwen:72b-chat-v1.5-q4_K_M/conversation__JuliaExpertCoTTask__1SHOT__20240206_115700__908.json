It then pipes the grouped DataFrame to `values`, which extracts the DataFrames for each group. The `map(length)` applies the `length` function to each group's DataFrame, effectively counting the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,127],"elapsed":7.296439582,"_type":"aimessage"}]
