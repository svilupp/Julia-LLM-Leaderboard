It then calculates the length of each group, which represents the number of rows for each model.\n\nThe result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`. The merged DataFrame contains the counts for each model.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\"], price=[20000, 18000, 22000]))\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will output a DataFrame with the count of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":13.181506493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
