Then, it pipes the resulting GroupedDataFrame to `values`, which gives a vector of DataFrames, each corresponding to a unique model. \n\nNext, we create a new DataFrame with two steps: (1) use `map(length, _)` to calculate the number of rows for each group; (2) use `DataFrame!(rows=..., columns=...)` to construct the new DataFrame directly.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame has one column named \"row_count\", and each row represents the count of rows for a specific car model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":10.306661473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
