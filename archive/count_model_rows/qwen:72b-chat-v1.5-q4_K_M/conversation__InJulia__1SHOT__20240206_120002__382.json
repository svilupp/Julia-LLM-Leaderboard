Here's a function `count_model_rows` that does exactly what you've described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    result = DataFrame(model=String[], count=Int[])\n    for (name, group) in grouped_df\n        push!(result, (model=name, count=size(group, 1))))\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column. Then it iterates over each group and calculates the number of rows using `size(group, 1))`. The results are stored in a new DataFrame `result`, which is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":10.282085138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
