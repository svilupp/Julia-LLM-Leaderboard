Then, it uses the `namevalue` function to obtain a dictionary of model names and their respective row counts by specifying the `:model` column and the `size` function. Finally, the function returns this dictionary, providing the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[60,142],"elapsed":2.557249625,"cost":0.00018179999999999997,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1960338039,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
