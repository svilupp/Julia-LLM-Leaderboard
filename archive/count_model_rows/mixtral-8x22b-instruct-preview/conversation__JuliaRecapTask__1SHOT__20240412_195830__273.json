[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame df_cars with column `model`, write a function `count_model_rows` that groups data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Recall Julia snippets\nHere are some Julia snippets we'll need for this task:\n\n## Data manipulation\n- `groupby`: used for grouping data by a particular column.\n- `count`: counts the number of rows for each group.\n\n## DataFrame definition\n- A DataFrame is defined using `DataFrame`.\n\n## Example DataFrame\n- The example DataFrame is named df_cars and has a column named `model`.\n\n# Solve the Task\nHere's the Julia code to solve the task:\n```\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = map(count, grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function, called `count_model_rows`, takes a DataFrame named df_cars as an input parameter.
