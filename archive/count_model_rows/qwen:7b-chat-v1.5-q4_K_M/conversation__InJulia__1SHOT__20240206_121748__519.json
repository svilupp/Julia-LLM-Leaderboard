Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrame\n\n# Assuming your DataFrame is called df_cars\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group by 'model' and calculate the length (number of rows) for each group\n    model_counts = by(df_cars, :model), length)\n    \n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will output a table-like structure showing the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[52,161],"elapsed":1.68941898,"_type":"aimessage"}]
