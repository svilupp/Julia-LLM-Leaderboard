The `count_model_rows` function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input.\n2. It uses the `groupby` function from Datasets to group the data by `model`.\n3. For each unique model, it counts the number of rows in that group (i.e., how many times does the model appear).\n4. The result is converted into a dictionary-like structure and stored as a new DataFrame called `count_map`.\n5. Finally, the function returns the `count_map` DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\ndf_count_models = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":2.049485331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
