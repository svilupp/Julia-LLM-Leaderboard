It then calculates the count of rows for each model using `length` on the grouped data. The result is returned as a dictionary where keys are the group names (models) and values are another dictionary with key 'count' and its value being the row count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,137],"elapsed":1.414214782,"_type":"aimessage"}]
