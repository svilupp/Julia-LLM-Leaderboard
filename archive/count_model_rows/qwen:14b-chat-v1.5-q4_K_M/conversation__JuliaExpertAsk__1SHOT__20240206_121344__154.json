Here's the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars, model_col = \"model\"))\n    grouped_df = group(df_cars, model_col))\n    size_of_groups = map(grouped_df) do row\n        nrow(row)\n    end\n    \n    DataFrame(model = keys(size_of_groups)), \n                   count = values(size_of_groups)))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and an optional column name `model_col` (default is \"model\"). It groups the data by model, counts the rows for each group, and returns a new DataFrame with the model names and their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,171],"elapsed":2.676904976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
