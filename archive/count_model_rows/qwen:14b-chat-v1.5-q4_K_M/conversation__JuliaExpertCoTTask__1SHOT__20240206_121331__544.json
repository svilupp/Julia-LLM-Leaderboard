Here's a step-by-step explanation and the code:\n\n1. First, import the necessary libraries:\n```jl\nusing DataFrame\n```\n1. Define the `count_model_rows` function that takes a DataFrame as input:\n```jl\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group data by model and count rows for each group\n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model))\n    row_counts = map!(count, grouped_df)\n    \n    # Create a new DataFrame with model names and row counts\n    result = DataFrame(model=keys(row_counts)), row_count=row_counts)\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n1. Now you can call the `count_model_rows` function using the provided `df_cars` DataFrame:\n```jl\ndf_result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndf_result\n```\nThis will output a DataFrame with model names and the corresponding row counts.\n:\n:\n:","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":3.481939343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
