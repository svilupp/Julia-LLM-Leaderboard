Here's a function that does what you described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars, column_name)\n    grouped_df = group(df_cars, column_name))\n    counts = mapreduce(g -> length(g), identity), +, grouped_df)\n    \n    return Dict(zip(grouped_df[!, column_name]]), counts))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `df_cars`, which is your DataFrame containing the `model` column, and `column_name` (in this case, it's \"model\"), which is the name of the column to group by.\n\nThe function returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique values from the specified column, and the values are the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":2.786486996,"_type":"aimessage"}]
