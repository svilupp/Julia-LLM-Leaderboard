Then, it counts the number of rows in each group using `map(count, ...))`. Finally, it returns a dictionary where keys are model names and values are row counts.\n\nRunning this code with the provided data will return the row count for each unique model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":2.641982825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
