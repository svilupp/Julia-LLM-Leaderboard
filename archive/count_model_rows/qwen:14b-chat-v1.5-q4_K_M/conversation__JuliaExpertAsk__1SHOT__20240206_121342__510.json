Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars, model_column = \"model\"))\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, model_column))\n    counts = mapreduce(grouped_df) do df_group\n        nrow(df_group)\n    end, +, init=0)\n    \n    return Dict(zip(map(collect, keys(counts))))..., values(counts))))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and an optional column name `model_column`. It groups the data by model, counts the rows for each group, and returns the result as a dictionary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":2.565672506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
