Here's a concise implementation of the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame, model_col::Symbol)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, model_col))\n    row_counts = map(length, values(grouped)))\n    DataFrame(model = names(grouped), row_count = row_counts))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` (`df_cars`) and the symbol of the column containing models (`model_col`). It groups the data by model using `groupby`, counts the rows in each group using `map(length, values(...)))`, and finally constructs a new `DataFrame` with the model names and row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":2.643315552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
