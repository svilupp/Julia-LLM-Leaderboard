It uses the `groupby` function from Julia's DataFrames package to group the data by the `model` column.\n\nFor each group, it calculates the number of rows (`length(g)`). It then constructs a new row with the model and the count of rows.\n\nFinally, it returns a DataFrame where each row represents a model with its corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.961590328,"_type":"aimessage"}]
