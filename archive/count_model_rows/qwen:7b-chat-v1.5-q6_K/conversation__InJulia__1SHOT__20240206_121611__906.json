Here's an example with the `df_cars` DataFrame:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model))\n    count_rows_per_group = Dict{String, Int64}}()\n    \n    for (model, group) in grouped_data\n        count_rows_per_group[model] = length(group)\n    end\n    \n    return count_rows_per_group\nend\n\n# Now you can call the function with your DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function groups the DataFrame by `model` and calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a dictionary where keys are model names, and values are the corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":2.137196226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
