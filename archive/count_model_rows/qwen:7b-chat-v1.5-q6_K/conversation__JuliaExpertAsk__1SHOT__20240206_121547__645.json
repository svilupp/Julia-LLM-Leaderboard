This DataFrame has two columns: 'model' and a count column (denoted by `_` to avoid conflict with any other variable).\n\nThe count for each model in `df_cars` is calculated using the `count _` syntax.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `group_count` DataFrame, where rows with missing model information are removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,151],"elapsed":1.798921805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
