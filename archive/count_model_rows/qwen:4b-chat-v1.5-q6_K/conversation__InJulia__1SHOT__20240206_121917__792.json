The function then returns a new DataFrame `result_df` that groups data by model and calculates how many rows there are for each.\nFor example, if the input DataFrame `df_cars` has the following contents:\n```makefile\nmodel   count\nFord     50\nBMW       40\n Mercedes 30\n```\n\nThe output DataFrame `result_df` will have the following contents:\n```makefile\nmodel   count\nFord     25\nBMW       20\n Mercedes 15\n```\n\nIn this example, the output DataFrame `result_df` groups data by model and calculates how many rows there are for each.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":1.73609725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
