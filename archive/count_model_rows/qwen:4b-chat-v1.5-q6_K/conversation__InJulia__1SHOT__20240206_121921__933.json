The function then groups the data by model using `groupby()`. It calculates how many rows there are for each model using `size()` on the resulting Grouping object. Finally, it returns a Dictionary that maps each model to the number of rows in the data for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,133],"elapsed":1.254000612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
