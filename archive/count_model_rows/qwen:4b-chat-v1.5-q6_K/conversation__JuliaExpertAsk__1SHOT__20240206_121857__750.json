The function `count_model_rows` takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input.\n2. The function first creates an array `group_by` that contains only the rows where the model column in `df_cars` matches one of the values in the `models` list.\n3. After creating the `group_by` array, the function then calculates how many rows there are for each value in the `models` list. The number of rows is obtained from the length of each row that appears in the `group_by` array. The sum of these lengths gives the total number of rows.\n4. Finally, the function returns the calculated total number of rows for each value in the `models` list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":2.002619743,"_type":"aimessage"}]
