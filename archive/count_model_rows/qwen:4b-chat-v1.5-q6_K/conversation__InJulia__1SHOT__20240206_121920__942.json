It then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `count()` method of the resulting `grouped_df` object.\n\nFinally, the function returns a new DataFrame with two columns: one containing the count of rows for each model (as an integer), and another containing the count of rows for each model (as a string)).","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":1.541448051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
