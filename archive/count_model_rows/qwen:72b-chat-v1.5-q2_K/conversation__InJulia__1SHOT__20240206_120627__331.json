Then, you can apply the `size` function to count the number of rows for each group.\n\nHere's the function definition:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = map(size, groups) .[1]\n    return Dict(zip(counts, keys(groups)))))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` `df_cars` as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the model names and the values are the corresponding row counts.\n\nMake sure you have the `DataFrames` package installed. If not, you can install it using `add` from `Pkg`:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\n\nRemember to import `DataFrames` in your code before using the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":9.288461539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
