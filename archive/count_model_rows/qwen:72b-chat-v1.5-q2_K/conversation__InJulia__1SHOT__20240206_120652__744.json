Import the necessary libraries.\n2. Define the function `count_model_rows`.\n3. Group the DataFrame by the `model` column, and count the number of rows for each group.\n\nHere's the code to implement the above steps:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    model_counts = valuecount(grouped_df[:model]))\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, simply call the function:\n\n```julia\ncar_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(car_counts)\n```\n\nThis will print out a dictionary containing each car model and its corresponding row count in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":7.659646698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
