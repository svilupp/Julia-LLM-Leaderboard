Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    group_counts = @chain df _\n                        |> GroupBy(:model)\n                        |> collect\n                        |> DataFrame\n    return group_counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first load the `DataFrames` package. The `count_model_rows` function takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n\nInside the function, we use the `@chain` macro from the Chain.jl package to chain multiple operations together efficiently.\n\nFirst, we group the data by the `model` column using the `GroupBy` function. Then, we collect the grouped data into a new DataFrame.\n\nFinally, we return this new DataFrame, which contains the count of rows for each model in the original DataFrame `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":8.313744221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
