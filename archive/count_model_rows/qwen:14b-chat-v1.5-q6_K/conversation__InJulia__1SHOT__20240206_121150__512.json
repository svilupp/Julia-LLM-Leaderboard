Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to create the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the DataFrames and SortingAlgorithms packages installed. If not, install them using:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\"DataFrames\", \"SortingAlgorithms\"]))\n```\n2. Next, load the DataFrames package:\n```julia\nimport DataFrames\n```\n3. Now, define the `count_model_rows` function that takes a DataFrame df_cars as an argument and returns a new DataFrame with model counts:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model))\n    counted_df = DataFrame(model=keys(grouped_df)), \n                                           count=[count for (_, count) in values(grouped_df))])\n    return sorted!(counted_df, [:model]])\nend\n```\nThis function groups the DataFrame by the `model` column, counts the occurrences of each model, and returns a new DataFrame with model names and their respective counts. The returned DataFrame is also sorted alphabetically by `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":4.836702338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
