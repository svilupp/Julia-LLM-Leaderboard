Define the `count_model_rows` function:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    group_counts = groupby(df, :model), nrow)\n    \n    return group_counts\nend\n```\n3. Call the `count_model_rows` function with the provided DataFrame `df_cars`:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe variable `result` will contain a grouped table with model names and corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,162],"elapsed":3.079682041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
