It groups the data by model using the `groupby` function, and then counts the rows for each group using `countrows`.\n\nFinally, the example DataFrame `df_cars` is created and passed to the `count_model_rows` function. The result will show the count of rows for each car model in the input DataFrame.\nassistant","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":2.992171507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
