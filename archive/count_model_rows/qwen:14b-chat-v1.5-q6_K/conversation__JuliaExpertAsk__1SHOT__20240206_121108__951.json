Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model))\n    row_counts = count(grouped_df, Identity())\n    return row_counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. The `groupby` function is used to create a new DataFrame with rows grouped by the `:model` column.\n2. The `count` function is applied to the grouped DataFrame using `Identity()` as the count function (which counts all elements).\n3. The resulting `row_counts` variable contains a collection of row counts for each unique model in the original DataFrame.\n\nNow you can call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":3.286328864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
