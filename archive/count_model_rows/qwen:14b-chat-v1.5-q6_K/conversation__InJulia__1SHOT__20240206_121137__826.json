Here's an example of how to define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined as a DataFrame\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    # Group data by model and count rows for each group\n    grouped_df = groupby(df, :model))\n    row_counts = map(eachgroup(grouped_df)), x -> length(x))\n\n    # Combine the models and row counts into a new DataFrame\n    result = DataFrame(model=names(row_counts)), row_count=row_counts)\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call `count_model_rows(df_cars)` to get a DataFrame with model names and their corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":3.172147271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
