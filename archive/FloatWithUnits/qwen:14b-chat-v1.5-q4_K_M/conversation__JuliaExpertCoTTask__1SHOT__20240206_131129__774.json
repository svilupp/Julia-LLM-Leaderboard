Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`.\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Number\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n2. Implement the `show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits))` method to display the struct with a concatenated value and unit.\n```julia\nimport Base: show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, string(x.value), \" \", x.unit))\nend\n```\n3. Test the `show` method using the provided data.\n```julia\n# Test case\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(STDOUT, x)  # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nNow you have implemented the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct as per the task requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":3.298158433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
