Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow that we have the struct defined, let's create the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nimport Base: show\n\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, string(f.value), \" \", f.unit))\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` function takes an `io` (input/output) stream and a `FloatWithUnits` instance. It concatenates the value and unit with a space using Julia's `string` and `println` functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":2.515820183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
