Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n2. Implement the `show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits))` function.\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, string(x.value), \" \", x.unit))\nend\n```\n\nNow you have a custom `show` method that formats the `FloatWithUnits` struct as specified.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":2.495383201,"_type":"aimessage"}]
