Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with the fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Implement a newtype for the `FloatWithUnits` struct to ensure that it's not treated as a regular float.\n3. Override the `show` method for the newtype using `@show`.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Create a newtype to ensure correct printing\nconst FloatWithUnitsNewtype = newtype(FloatWithUnits, :show))\n\n# Step 3: Override the show method for the newtype\n@show FloatWithUnitsNewtype(value, \"meters\"), unit => \" meters\") # Example usage\n\n```\n\nNow when you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and use `println`, it will display the value and unit concatenated with a space. For example:\n\n```julia\nfwa = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\nprintln(fwa)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":3.100992069,"_type":"aimessage"}]
