Then, implement the `show` method for this struct.\n\nHere's the code that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement the show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\") )\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\nprintln(float_with_units)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nNow you have a `FloatWithUnits` struct with the desired `show` method, and an example usage that demonstrates how to display a `FloatWithUnits` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":2.314255747,"_type":"aimessage"}]
