Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Define the structure:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n2. Create the `show` function:\n```julia\nfunction show_floatwithunits(fwu)\n    value_str = string(fwu.value))\n    unit_str = quote $fwu.unit \\end{quote}\n    return \"$(value_str) $(unit_str)}\"\nend\n```\n3. Test the `show` method:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))\nprintln(show_floatwithunits(fwu)))\n```\nThis will output:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method has been created that concatenates the value and unit with a space as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":2.144690827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
