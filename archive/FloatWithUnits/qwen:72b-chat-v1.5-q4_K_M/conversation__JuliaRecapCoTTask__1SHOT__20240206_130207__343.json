[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since there are no special instructions, I'll proceed with the standard approach to solve the task.\n\nFirst, let's define the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n```\n\nNow we will implement the `show` method for this struct:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, wu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(wu.value) $(wu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nWith these definitions, when you display a `FloatWithUnits` object, it will show the value and unit separated by a space, just as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":8.257934063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
