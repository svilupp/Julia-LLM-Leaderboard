FloatWithUnits{Unit}} value::Unit\nfield! FloatWithUnits{Unit}} unit::Unit\nend\n```\n\nNow that we have extracted the value and unit from each instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, we can create a `show` method for it like this:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{Unit}}\nfield! FloatWithUnits{Unit}} value::Unit\nfield! FloatWithUnits{Unit}} unit::Unit\nend\n\nfunction show(fwu)\n    println(\"Value: $fwu.value, Unit: $fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nFloatWithUnits{meters}} = 1.8 meters\nshow(FloatWithUnits{meters}}))\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct as input and prints out a formatted string that displays the value and unit of the given instance of the struct.\n\nNote that this example assumes that you have already defined a struct called `FloatWithUnits{Unit}}`, with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!)","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.661339265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
