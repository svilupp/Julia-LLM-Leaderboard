It takes an argument `x::FloatWithUnits)` and returns a string representation of `x`.\n\nThe `show` method first concatenates the value and unit of `x` with a space using the `string` function. The resulting string is stored in the variable `str`.\n\nFinally, the `show` method prints out the string `str` using the `println` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,128],"elapsed":1.21530463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
