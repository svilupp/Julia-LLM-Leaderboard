The `T<:AbstractUnit{T>}` constraint ensures that the unit is an instance of the abstract unit `T`.\n\nThe `show` function takes a `FloatWithUnits{T}}` struct as input, calculates the product of the value and the unit using Julia's arithmetic operations, and prints the result to the console using Julia's `println` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":1.480985596,"_type":"aimessage"}]
