We also define an attribute called `show` which takes an argument of type `FloatWithUnits` and returns a string containing the concatenated value and unit.\nFinally, in the last line of the code block above, we test the implementation by passing an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct to the `show` method. The expected output is \"1.8 meters\", which matches what the implementation produces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.603876412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
