It then defines two methods: `show` and `f.value * f.unit`.\nThe `show` method takes an argument in the form of a string. The method concatenates the value and unit fields of the struct `FloatWithUnits` with a space character, like this: \"1.8 meters\".\nThe second method takes another argument in the form of a field value. The method multiplies the value of the field by the unit field of the struct `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.799964682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
