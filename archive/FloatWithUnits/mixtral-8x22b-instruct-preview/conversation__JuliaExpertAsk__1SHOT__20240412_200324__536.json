In this case, the goal is to display the `value` and `unit` of the struct `FloatWithUnis`. The `show` function is defined for `io::IO` - a generic I/O object, and `v::FloatWithUnits` - the data structure we're writing the method for. \n\nThe function does this by calling `show` for each field of our `value` and `unit`, first for `value` (a `Float32`), and then for `unit` (a `String","status":200,"tokens":[117,200],"elapsed":3.440899542,"cost":0.0002853,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"length","run_id":1746846437,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
