It iterates over each word and checks if it starts with a capital letter using the `starts_with_capital` helper function.\n3. If the word meets this criteria, it is added to the `filtered_words` array.\n4. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` array, which contains only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.688299145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
