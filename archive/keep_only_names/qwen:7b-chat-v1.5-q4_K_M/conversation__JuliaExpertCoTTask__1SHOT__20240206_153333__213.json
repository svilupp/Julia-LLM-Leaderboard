It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the words and create a new list with only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\nIn the given example, \"dog\" is removed because it doesn't start with a capital letter. The resulting list contains [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,142],"elapsed":1.469574821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
