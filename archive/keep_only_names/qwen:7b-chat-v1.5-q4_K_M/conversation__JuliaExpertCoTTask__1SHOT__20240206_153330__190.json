When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()] \n\nresult = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\nprint(result)  # Output: ['Apple', 'Carrot']\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `keep_only_names` iterates over the provided list of words. It checks if the first letter of a word is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If it's not, the word is removed from the list using a list comprehension.\n\nIn the given example, \"dog\" is removed because its first letter \"d\" is not capitalized. The final result is ['Apple', 'Carrot'].","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":1.541766284,"_type":"aimessage"}]
