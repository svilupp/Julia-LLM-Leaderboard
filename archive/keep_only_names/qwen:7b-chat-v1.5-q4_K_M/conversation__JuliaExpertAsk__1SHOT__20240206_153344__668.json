The `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list called `filtered_words` to store the retained words.\n3. The function iterates over each word in the input list.\n4. For each word, it checks if the first letter is capitalized using the `starts_with_capital_letter` helper function.\n5. If the first letter is indeed capital, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list.\n6. After iterating through all words, the function returns the retained words.\n\nPlease note that in this implementation, I have used a simplified check for the first capital letter (`starts_with_capital_letter`). In real-world scenarios, you might need to handle cases with mixed cases, hyphens, or apostrophes correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.416849487,"_type":"aimessage"}]
