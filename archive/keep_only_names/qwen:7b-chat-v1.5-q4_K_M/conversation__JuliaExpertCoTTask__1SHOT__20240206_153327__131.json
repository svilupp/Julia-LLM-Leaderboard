For each word, it checks if the first letter is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the condition is met, the word is added to the result list.\n\nThe example `data` returned by the function after applying the rule is `['Apple', 'Carrot']`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,141],"elapsed":1.457680742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
