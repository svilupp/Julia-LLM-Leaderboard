[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the special instructions provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(start_with_capital Letter), words)\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if a word starts with a capital letter\nfunction start_with_capital_letter(word)\n    return isupperfirst(letter(word))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, I've created a `keep_only_names` function that filters the provided list of words. The filtering condition checks if each word starts with a capital letter.\n\nAdditionally, I've added a helper function `start_with_capital_letter` to check if a given word starts with a capital letter. This function uses the `isupperfirst` function from the standard library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,144],"elapsed":1.507517617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
