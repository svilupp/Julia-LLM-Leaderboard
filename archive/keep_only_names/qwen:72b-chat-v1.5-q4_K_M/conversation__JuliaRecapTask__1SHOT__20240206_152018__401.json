[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = filter(word -> beginswith(lowercase(word)), uppercase(word)[1]), words)\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords_list = [\"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Fish\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(kept_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\n\nIn this function, I first use the `filter` function to select only words that start with a capital letter. The condition for filtering is defined using `beginswith` and `uppercase`. \n\nAfter filtering, the resulting list of names is returned by the function.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `keep_only_names` function with a list of words, and then print the kept names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":9.361293715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
