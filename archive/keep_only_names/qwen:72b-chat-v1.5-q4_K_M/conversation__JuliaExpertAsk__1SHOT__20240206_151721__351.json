It checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using `isupper(first(word)))`. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words to keep only the capitalized ones:\n\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"cat\", \"Dog\", \"rabbit\"]\nkept_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(kept_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,147],"elapsed":8.414638783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
