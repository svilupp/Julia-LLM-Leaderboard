For example:\n\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nvalid_names = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(valid_names)  # Output: [\"dog\", \"bird\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function filters out \"cat\" and \"fish\" since they don't start with a capital letter. The remaining words (\"Dog\" and \"Bird\") are converted to lowercase and stored in the `valid_names` array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":14.517242126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
