The `keep_only_names` function takes a list of `words` as input.\n2. We use the `filter` function to create a new list called `names`.\n3. The filtering condition is defined using a lambda function: `(word -> occursin(r\"^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*$\", word)))`. This checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter followed by any number of lowercase or uppercase letters.\n4. After filtering, we return the new list of `names`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":12.063054348,"_type":"aimessage"}]
