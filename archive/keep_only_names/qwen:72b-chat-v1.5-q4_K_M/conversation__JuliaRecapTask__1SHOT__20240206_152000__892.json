[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    capitalized_words = filter(word -> isupper(first(word))), words)\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n\n# Test the function with some examples\nwords_list1 = [\"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Fish\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words_list1))  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n\nwords_list2 = [\"Julia\", \"python\", \"R\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words_list2))  # Output: [\"Julia\", \"R\"]\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input, checks if the first letter of each word is uppercase using `isupper(first(word)))`, and filters out the words that don't meet this criteria. The resulting list of capitalized words is returned by the function.\n\nThe provided test cases demonstrate how the function works with different inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":10.466569149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
