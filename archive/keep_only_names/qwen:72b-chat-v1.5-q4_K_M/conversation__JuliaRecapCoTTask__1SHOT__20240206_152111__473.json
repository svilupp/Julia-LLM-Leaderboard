[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since no specific instructions are given, I'll proceed with the default approach to solving this task.\n\nHere's a function in Julia that implements the described behavior:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = filter(word -> isupper:firstletter(word)), words)\n    return names\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"turtle\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(kept_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` iterates over the provided list of words, checks if the first letter of each word is uppercase using `isupper:firstletter(word)`, and filters out the words that don't meet this condition.
