It filters out the words that don't start with a capital letter using the `filter` function and a lambda expression. The resulting filtered list is then returned by the function.\n\nIn the provided data, the function call with the given argument is executed, storing the result in the `result` variable. Finally, the `println` function prints the result to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,157],"elapsed":9.036637397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
