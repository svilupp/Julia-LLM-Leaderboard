The condition is checked using a lambda function: `word -> uppercasefirst(word) == word`. This lambda function checks if the first letter of the word after being capitalized matches the original word, which means the word originally started with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,97],"elapsed":5.545343078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
