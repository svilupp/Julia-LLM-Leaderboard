It filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter using the `filter` function and a lambda expression. The resulting list of capitalized words is then returned by the function.\n\nIn the example provided, the function is called with a list of words, and the result is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,144],"elapsed":8.28014063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
