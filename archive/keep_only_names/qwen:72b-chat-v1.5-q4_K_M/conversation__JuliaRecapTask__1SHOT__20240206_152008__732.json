[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = filter(word -> isupper(first(word))), words)\n    return names\nend\n\n# Test the function with example input\nwords = [\"cat\", \"Dog\", \"rabbit\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Expected output: [\"Dog\"]\n```\n\nIn this solution, I defined a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as an argument. The function then filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter using the `filter` function and a lambda expression. Finally, it returns the filtered names.\n\nThe test at the end demonstrates how to use the function with example input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,140],"elapsed":8.139143703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
