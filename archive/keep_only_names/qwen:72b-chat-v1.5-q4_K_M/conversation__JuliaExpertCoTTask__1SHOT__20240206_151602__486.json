It uses Julia's `filter` function along with a lambda function to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. The resulting filtered list is then returned by the function.\n\nIn the last line, I demonstrate how to use the function by providing the given test data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,143],"elapsed":8.226218383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
