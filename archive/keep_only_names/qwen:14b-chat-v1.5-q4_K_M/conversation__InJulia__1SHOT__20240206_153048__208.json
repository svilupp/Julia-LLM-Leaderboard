Here's an example using iteration:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Iterate over the words and filter out non-names\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word[1] == uppercasefirst(word[1]))]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"DOG\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"DOG\"]\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `uppercasefirst` function is used to check if the first letter of a word is capitalized. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,159],"elapsed":2.48701348,"_type":"aimessage"}]
