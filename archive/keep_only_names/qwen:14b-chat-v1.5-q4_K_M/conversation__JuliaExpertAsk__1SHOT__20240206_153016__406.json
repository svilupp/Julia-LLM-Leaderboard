Here's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if starts_with_capital(word)]  \nend\n\nfunction starts_with_capital(word)\n    first_char = convert(Char, word[1]))\n    return first_char == uppercase(first_char)  \nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, `starts_with_capital` function checks if a word starts with a capital letter. The `keep_only_names` function filters out the words that don't match this criteria and returns only the names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,136],"elapsed":2.128573829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
