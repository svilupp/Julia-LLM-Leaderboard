[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and special instructions, I will write the `keep_only_names` function.\n\nHere's the systematic approach:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Use iteration to go through each word in the input list.\n3. Check if the first character of the current word is uppercase using Julia's built-in method for checking capitalization.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, keep the word in the result; otherwise, discard it.\n5. After iterating through all words, return the filtered list containing only the words that started with an uppercase letter.\n\nNow let's implement this function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` should fulfill the task and any special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":3.224303293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
