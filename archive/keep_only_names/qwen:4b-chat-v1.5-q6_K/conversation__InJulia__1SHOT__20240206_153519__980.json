For each word, it checks whether the word starts with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\")). \n\nIf the current word does not start with a capital letter, the function removes that word from the `filtered_words` string using the `-` operator.\n\nAfter iterating over all words in the input list of words (`words`), the function returns the `filtered_words` string which contains only the words that meet the criteria specified in the problem description.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":2.276002605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
