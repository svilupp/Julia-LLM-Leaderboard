If it is, the implementation proceeds to check the next character in the word. If the next character is also uppercase, the implementation adds the word to the output list of words. If the next character is not uppercase, the implementation continues checking the next character in the word.\n\nIf the last character in the input word does not start with an uppercase letter, the implementation raises an error message indicating that the input word contains a word that starts with a non-uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.800562958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
