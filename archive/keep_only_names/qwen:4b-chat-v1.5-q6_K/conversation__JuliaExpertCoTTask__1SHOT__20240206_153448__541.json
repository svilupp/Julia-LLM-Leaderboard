The function `keep_only_names` takes one argument, `words`, which is an AbstractVector{String}}.\n2. The function first defines a local function called `check_word_starts_with_capital_letter(word::AbstractString))`. This function checks if a word starts with a capital letter.\n3. Next, the function `check_word_starts_with_capital_letter(word::AbstractString))` is called with each element of the input vector `words`.\n4. If a word does not start with a capital letter, then the corresponding element in the output vector is set to `false`.\n5. After checking all words in the input vector, the output vector is returned from the function.\n6. In the given example, the input vector `words` contains the elements \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\". The output vector returned by the `keep_only_names` function contains the elements \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\" (since all words in this case start with a capital letter).","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":2.2456322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
