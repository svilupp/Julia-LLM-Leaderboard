If a word does not start with a capital letter, that word is ignored and not added to the output list.\n\nFinally, this implementation returns the filtered list of words, which only includes words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":1.39209164,"_type":"aimessage"}]
