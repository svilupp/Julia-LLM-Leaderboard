[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return wordsfilter(filter = beginwithcaps), wordsfilter(filter = endwith_caps), wordsfilter(filter = starts_with_caps)))\nend\n```\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n\n1. It calls the helper function `wordsfilter` which takes three arguments: a function that filters out certain words from the provided list, the original list of words to be filtered, and an additional optional argument called `words_to_filter` which is a vector of words that should be excluded from the filtering process using the provided function.\n2. It calls two helper functions `beginwithcaps`, `endwith_caps`,`starts_with_caps)` which take a single character as input and return either true or false depending on whether the provided character matches the beginning of any word in the provided list of words.\n3. The `keep_only_names` function returns the modified list of filtered words.\n\n## Example\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\"], 1:20, [1, 2], [[1, 2]]]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"cat\"] \n```\n\nThe example demonstrates how the `keep_only_names` function can be used to filter out all words in a provided list of words that do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":2.819096527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
