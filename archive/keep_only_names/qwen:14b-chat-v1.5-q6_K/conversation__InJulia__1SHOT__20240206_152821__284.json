The `isupperfirst` function is not a built-in Julia function, but you can create it as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction isupperfirst(word)\n    return word[1] ==uppercasefirst(word[1]))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(isupperfirst(\"Dog\")))  # Output: true\n```\n\nNow the `keep_only_names` function should work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[62,184],"elapsed":3.528155087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
