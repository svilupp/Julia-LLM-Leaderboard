[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a systematic approach to solving this task:\n\n1. Recall relevant Julia language features:\n   - Control structures: `if`, `else`, `end`\n   - Iteration: `for` loop\n   - String manipulation: checking if a word starts with a capital letter\n\n2. Define the function `keep_only_names`:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character is capitalized\n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(String的第一位字符(word[1]))))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check:\n   - The function definition follows the task description.\n   - The `for` loop iterates through each word in the input list.\n   - The capital letter check is performed using string manipulation functions.\n\n4. Function is ready to use with the given guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":3.895794494,"_type":"aimessage"}]
