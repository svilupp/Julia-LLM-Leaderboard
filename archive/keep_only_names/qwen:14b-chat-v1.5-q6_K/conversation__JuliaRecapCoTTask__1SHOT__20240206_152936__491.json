[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your special instructions, it seems like you want to handle certain edge cases or apply additional conditions. However, the provided task description is clear and doesn't require any specific exceptions.\n\nHere's a straightforward implementation of the `keep_only_names` function, assuming no special instructions:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if starts_with_capital(word)] \nend\n\nstarts_with_capital(word) = occursin(startswith(\" \", string(word)))) ? true : first(isuppercase, string(word))) != nothing\n```\nThis implementation checks if each word starts with a capital letter. If it does, the word is kept in the result.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any additional requirements or edge cases that need to be handled.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":3.087542686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
