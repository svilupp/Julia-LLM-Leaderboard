It uses a list comprehension to filter out the words that don't start with a capital letter, using the `starts_with_capital` helper function.\n\nTo test the function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":3.852699136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
