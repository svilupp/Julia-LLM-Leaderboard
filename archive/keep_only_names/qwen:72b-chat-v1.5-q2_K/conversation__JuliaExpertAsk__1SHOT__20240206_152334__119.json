It uses the `filter` function and the `startswith` function to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter. The `uppercase:firstbyte(word)` is used to convert the first character of the word to its uppercase equivalent, which is then compared with the first byte of the original word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,113],"elapsed":4.97588885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
