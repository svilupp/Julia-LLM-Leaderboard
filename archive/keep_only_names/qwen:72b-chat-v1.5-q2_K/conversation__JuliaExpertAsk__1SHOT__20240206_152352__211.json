It uses the `filter` function to iterate over each word in `words`. For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase using `isupper(first(characters))`.\n\nThe filtered words are then collected into a new list and returned. Note that `first` is used to get the first character of a string, and `characters` is used to convert a string into an array of characters.\n\nPlease note that in Julia `isuppercase` function only checks for ASCII uppercase letters (i.e., 'A' to 'Z'). If you need to handle non-ASCII uppercase letters (for example, in other languages), you'll need to customize the check accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":8.173951013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
