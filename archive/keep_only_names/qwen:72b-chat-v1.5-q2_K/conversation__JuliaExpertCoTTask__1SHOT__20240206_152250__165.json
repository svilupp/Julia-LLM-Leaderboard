It filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter, using the `isupper` and `first` functions to check if the first character is uppercase.\n\nThe function then returns the filtered list of capitalized words.\n\nAfter defining the function, it's tested with the provided data to ensure its correctness.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":6.571656432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
