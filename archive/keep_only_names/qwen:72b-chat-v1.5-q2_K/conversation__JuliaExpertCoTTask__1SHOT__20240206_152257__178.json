It filters out the words that do not start with a capital letter by using `isupper(firstbyte(word)))`. The filtered words are then returned as the output of the function.\n\nFinally, the function is tested with the provided data, and the result is printed to verify the correctness of the solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":7.327582579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
