It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the words that start with a capital letter. It iterates over each word in the input `words` and checks if the first character of the word is equal to its uppercase version. If it is, the word is added to the `result` list. Finally, the updated list of words `result` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[71,175],"elapsed":3.048584625,"cost":0.00022139999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1058017886,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
