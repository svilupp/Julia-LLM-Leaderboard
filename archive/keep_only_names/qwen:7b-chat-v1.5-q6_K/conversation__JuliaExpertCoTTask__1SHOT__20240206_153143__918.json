[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

If a word starts with a capital letter (`startswith(word, uppercase())`), it is added to the `filtered_words` vector.\n\nWhen you run the example with the provided data, it will output only the words that start with a capital letter. In this case, \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" are kept, while \"banana\", \"dog\", and \"Carrot\" are removed from the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":2.671670412,"_type":"aimessage"}]
