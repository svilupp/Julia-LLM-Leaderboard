It takes a list of words as input, which is passed through the `filter` function.\n3. The `filter` function keeps only those words that satisfy the condition inside the anonymous function passed to it (`w -> startswith(w, uppercase()), words)`)\n4. This condition checks if the word starts with a capital letter.\n\nSo, when you call this function with a list of words, it will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,145],"elapsed":1.729185522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
