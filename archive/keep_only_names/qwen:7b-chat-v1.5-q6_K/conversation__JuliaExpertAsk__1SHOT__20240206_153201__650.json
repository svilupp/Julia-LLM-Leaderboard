This is achieved by using the `startswith UpperCase` string check.\n- The filtered words are stored in the `filtered_words` variable and returned as the result of the function.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample list like:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[90,169],"elapsed":2.046156361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
