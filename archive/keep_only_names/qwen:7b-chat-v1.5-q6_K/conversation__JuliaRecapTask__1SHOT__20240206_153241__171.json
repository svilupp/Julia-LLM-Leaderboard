[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's the `keep_only_names` function in Julia following the task description and the guidelines:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Iterate over the words list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, uppercase()))\n            # If it does, keep the word\n            yield word\n        else\n            # If not, skip the word and move to the next one\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo test the function, you can create a list of words with both capital and non-capital initial letters:\n\n```julia\nwords_to_test = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Doggy\", \"apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_to_test)\n```\n\nThe `filtered_words` will contain only those words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":2.181052989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
