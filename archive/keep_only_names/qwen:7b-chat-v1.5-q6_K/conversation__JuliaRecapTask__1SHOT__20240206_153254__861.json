[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To write the function `keep_only_names`, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function with an input parameter for the `words` list.\n2. Create a variable to store words that start with a capital letter.\n3. Iterate over the `words` list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter (`word[1] == uppercase(word[1]))`). If not, remove it from the list of words that starts with a capital letter.\n5. After iterating through all the words, return only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}})\n    capitalized_words = Set{String}()\n\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1]])\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    return collect(capitalized_words))\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with a list of words to keep only the ones that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.683647554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
