Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Use the built-in `filter` function to iterate over the `words` list. The condition is `w -> !islower(w[1]), w)`, which checks if the first letter of each word is capitalized.\n3. If the condition for a word is true, it remains in the `filtered_words` list; otherwise, it's removed.\n4. Finally, return the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,146],"elapsed":1.740814149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
