[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if starts_with_capital(word)\n            filtered_words += word => word\n        end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\nfunction starts_with_capital(word::String))\n    return capitalizefirst-letter(word) == word\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n1. `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as input.\n2. It initializes an empty array `filtered_words` to store the filtered words.\n3. The function iterates over each word in the input list.\n4. For each word, it checks if the first letter is capitalized using the `starts_with_capital` function.\n5. If the word starts with a capital letter, it adds the word (as a tuple containing the original word and itself for immutability) to the `filtered_words` array.\n6. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` array containing only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":2.529836759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
