[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase()))\n            filtered_words .= word => true\n        end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Create an empty array `filtered_words` to store the words that pass the capitalization check.\n3. Iterate over each word in the `words` list.\n4. Check if the first letter of the word is uppercase using `startswith(word, uppercase())`.\n5. If the word starts with a capital letter, add it to the `filtered_words` array using dictionary syntax (`word => true`) which will include the word itself without modification.\n6. After iterating through all words, return the `filtered_words` array.\n\nThis function will remove all words that do not start with a capital letter from the provided list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":2.453606128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
