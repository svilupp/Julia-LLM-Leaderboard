It does this by using a comprehension to generate a list of anonymous functions. Each function takes a `(y, m)` tuple and returns it as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". This integer is then stored in the `ym` column for each row.\n\nNote: If your Julia version is 1.6 or later, you can use the `ZonedDateTime` from the `Dates` module instead of anonymous functions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":6.806248573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
