[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The function will extract the year and month using the `year` and `month` methods of DateTime objects, then concatenate them together as an integer.\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> x.year * 100 + x.month, df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, adds a new column `ym`, and returns the updated DataFrame. The concatenation is done by multiplying the year by 100 and then adding the month number.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":6.948467168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
