[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We will use the `DateTime` and `Date` modules to extract the year and month, then concatenate them together.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> parse(Int, \"$(year(x))$(month(x)))\")), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nHere's a quick explanation of the code:\n\n- We import the `Dates` module to work with DateTimes.\n- The function takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n- A new column `ym` is created in `df`, using the `map` function to apply the year-month concatenation to each row's `dt` value.\n- Finally, the updated DataFrame is returned.\n\nNow, you can use this function with your provided DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,183],"elapsed":8.269176372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
