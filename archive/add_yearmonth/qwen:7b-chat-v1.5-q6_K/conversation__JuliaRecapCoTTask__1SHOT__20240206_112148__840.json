[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The user has provided the task description and special instructions, which are empty for this case.\n\nHere's a Julia function `add_yearmonth` that follows the task description:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, instructions::String = \"\")\n    # Check if `dt` column exists\n    if !haskey(df.columns, \"dt\"))\n        error(\"Column 'dt' not found in DataFrame.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    df[\"ym\"] =地貌.(df[\"dt\"]) .| String(\"0\") .* (YearMonth.(df[\"dt\"])) .- YearMonth(1))\n    \n    if !isempty(instructions)\n        printlnstyled(\"Special Instruction: \", bold=true) do instr\n            println(instr)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` with a column named `dt` for DateTimes, and an optional `instructions` String.\n\nThe function first checks if the `dt` column exists. If it does, it extracts the year and month from the Datetimes using the `YearMonth` constructor and string interpolation. The resulting integers in \"yyyymm\" format are concatenated to a new column named `ym`.\n\nFinally, if any special instructions were provided, they are printed out.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame `df` as follows:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming you have a DataFrame named df\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":3.825883062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
