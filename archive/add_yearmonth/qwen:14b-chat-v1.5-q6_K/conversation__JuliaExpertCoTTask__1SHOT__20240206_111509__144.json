Inside the function, I use `strftime` to format each datetime in the \"dt\" column into a string in the format \"yyyymm\". Then, I convert these strings to integers and assign them to a new column \"ym\" in the input DataFrame.\n\nAfter defining the function, I create a sample DataFrame `df` with the given datetimes. Finally, I call the `add_yearmonth` function on this DataFrame to demonstrate its usage.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":3.873649095,"_type":"aimessage"}]
