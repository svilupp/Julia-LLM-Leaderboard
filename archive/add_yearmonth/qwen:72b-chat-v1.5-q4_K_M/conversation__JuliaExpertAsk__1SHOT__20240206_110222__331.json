It does this by mapping over the `dt` column and extracting the year and month. These are concatenated together as a string in the format \"yyyymm\", which is then converted to an integer and stored in the new `ym` column. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,126],"elapsed":7.21075259,"_type":"aimessage"}]
