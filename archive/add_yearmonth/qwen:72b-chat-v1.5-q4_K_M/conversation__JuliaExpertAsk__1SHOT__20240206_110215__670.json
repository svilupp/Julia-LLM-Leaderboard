It does this by mapping over the `dt` column, extracting the year and month using `year` and `month` functions respectively. \n\nThen it concatenates them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". To achieve this, the year and padded month are first converted to string, concatenated with a zero, then parsed back to an integer.\n\nFinally, the modified DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,148],"elapsed":8.474249024,"_type":"aimessage"}]
