It first maps over each `dt` in the `dt` column. For each `dt`, it creates a `DateTime` object using the year and month from `dt`. Then, it converts this `DateTime` object to an `Date` object, effectively discarding the time information. Finally, it extracts the integer value of this `Date` object, which represents the number of days since January 1st, 0001. This is then assigned as the value for the new `ym` column in the DataFrame.\n\nNote: The function assumes that all values in the input `df[:dt]` are valid DateTimes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":11.592250752,"_type":"aimessage"}]
