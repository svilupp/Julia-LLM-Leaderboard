The `string` function is used to convert them into strings, which are then concatenated using `*`. Finally, `parse(Int)` converts the concatenated string back to an integer.\n\nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df is already defined\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":2.335455953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
