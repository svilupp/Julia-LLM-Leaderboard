The function extracts the year and month from the `dt` column using the `Year` and `Month` functions from the `Dates` module.\n\nThe resulting year and month are concatenated into a single integer string in the format \"yyyyymm\". This new value is then added to the DataFrame as a new column named \"ym\".\n\nFinally, the function is tested with the provided DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[228,147],"elapsed":12.370095321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
