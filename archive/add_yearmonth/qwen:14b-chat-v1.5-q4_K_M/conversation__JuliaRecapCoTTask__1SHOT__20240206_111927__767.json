[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall useful Julia snippets:\n   - For creating a new column based on existing data, we'll use `df[!, \"ym\"]] = ...`\n   - For extracting year and month from a DateTime, we can use `yearmonth(dt)`.\n   - For formatting the concatenated year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\", we can use `Int(string(yearmonth(dt))))).\n\n2. Write the function `add_yearmonth`:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt_column::Symbol)\n    df[!, \"ym\"]] = Int(string(yearmonth.(df[, dt_column]])))); \n    return df\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check the solution:\n- The function is defined with input parameters as expected.\n- It uses appropriate Julia snippets for creating a new column, extracting year and month, and formatting the result.\n- The function should work correctly given an input DataFrame and datetime column.\n\nNow you have a systematic approach to solve this task following the guidelines and special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":3.699070206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
