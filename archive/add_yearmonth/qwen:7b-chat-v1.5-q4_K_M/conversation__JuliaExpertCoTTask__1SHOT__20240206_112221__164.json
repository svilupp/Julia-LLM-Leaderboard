Import `datetime` for handling dates.\n2. Define the `add_yearmonth` function that takes a DataFrame as input.\n3. Use `map` along with the lambda function to extract the year and month from each date in the 'dt' column.\n4. Concatenate the year and month as an integer in \"yyyymm\" format using `int()`.\n5. Add a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame with the calculated values.\n6. Finally, I provide an example DataFrame and call the function to demonstrate its functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":2.30985087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
