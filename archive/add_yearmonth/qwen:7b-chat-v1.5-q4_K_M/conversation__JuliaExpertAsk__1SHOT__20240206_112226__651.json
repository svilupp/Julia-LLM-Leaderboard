The `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame `df` and the name of the column containing DateTimes (`col_name`).\n\n2. It maps each DateTime in the specified column to a string, extracting the year and month.\n\n3. The resulting strings are concatenated with the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\n4. Finally, the new column `ym` is added to the DataFrame and it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":1.571673319,"_type":"aimessage"}]
