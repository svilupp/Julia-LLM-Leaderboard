Define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. Create a new column `\"ym\"` in the DataFrame.\n3. Use the `year` and `month` functions from the `DateComponents` module to extract the year and month from the `\"dt\"` column.\n4. Concatenate the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The `$` before `month` is used to handle months with leading zeros (e.g., '01' for January)).\n5. Assign the new column `\"ym\"` to the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.699429071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
