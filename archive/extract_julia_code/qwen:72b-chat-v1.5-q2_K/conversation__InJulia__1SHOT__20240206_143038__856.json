It then finds all matches using `matchall`. Finally, it joins the matched code blocks with a newline and returns the resulting string.\n\nNow you can use this function on your markdown document `md` to extract the Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":7.708302882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
