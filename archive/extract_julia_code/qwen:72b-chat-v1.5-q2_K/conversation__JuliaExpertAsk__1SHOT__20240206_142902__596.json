It then searches the markdown input `md` for matches.\n\nIf no matches are found or there are no captured code blocks, it returns an empty string.\n\nOtherwise, it processes the matched code block(s) by removing the code fences and joining any multiple code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`). The resulting String is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":9.29534218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
