[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task description, we can proceed to write the function `extract_julia_code`. The special instructions do not provide any additional context, so we will use the standard approach for handling markdown code blocks.\n\nHere's the implementation of `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    regex = r\"```julia[\\r\\n]+(.*?)[\\r\\n]+```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches and extract the code content\n    matches = matchall(regex, md)\n\n    # Remove the code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = map(match -> match[2], matches)\n    code_content = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_content\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines a regular expression to match Julia code blocks. It then finds all the matches in the provided markdown document `md`.\n\nNext, it extracts the content from each code block by removing the code fences (i.e., `````). Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the input markdown is properly formatted. If the markdown document contains malformed code blocks or unexpected patterns, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":12.422666093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
