Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    lines = split(replace(md, \"```jl\\n\", \"\"), \"\\n\", \"\\n\"), \"\\n\\n\"\n    joined_code = join(lines, \"\\n\"))\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document (`md`) as input. It first splits the document into lines based on double newline separation. Then it joins these lines with a single newline character. Finally, it returns the resulting joined code as a String.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle multiple code blocks within one markdown line. If you need to handle such cases, the function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,144],"elapsed":1.488252554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
