It iterates over each line in the document and checks if it starts with Julia code fences.\n\nIf a code block is found, it removes the code fences, joins the lines together (with a newline between them), and adds this code block to the extracted code.\n\nFinally, the function returns the combined Julia code as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":1.80924979,"_type":"aimessage"}]
