[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Read the `md` file line by line.\n2. Search for Julia code blocks enclosed in triple backticks (````) at the beginning of a line.\n3. When you find a code block, remove the fences by replacing them with empty strings.\n4. Concatenate all extracted code blocks together with a newline character (\\n).\n5. Return the resulting String.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md_file):\n    extracted_code = ''\n    line_number = 1\n    \n    with open(md_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            # Check if the line starts with triple backticks\n            if re.match(r'```\\s*Julia\\s*```', line.strip())):\n                code_block = line.replace('`', '')  # Remove fences\n                extracted_code += '\\n' + str(line_number) + ': ' + code_block\n                line_number += 1\n                \n    return extracted_code\n```\n\nNow you can use this function to extract Julia code from a given markdown file.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":2.654938595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
