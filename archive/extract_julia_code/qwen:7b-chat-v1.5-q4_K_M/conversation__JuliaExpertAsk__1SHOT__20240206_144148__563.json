It first splits the document by multiple empty lines (code fences), which represent the start of a code block.\n\nThen, it iterates through these code blocks, removes the code fence characters (`stripINDWs(.)`), and joins each block with a newline.\n\nFinally, it returns the combined code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":1.636815977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
