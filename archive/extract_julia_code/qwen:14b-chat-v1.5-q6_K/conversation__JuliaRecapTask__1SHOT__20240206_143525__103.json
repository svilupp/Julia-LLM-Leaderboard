[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We'll define a function `extract_julia_code` that follows the steps outlined in the task.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    parsed_md = parse_document(md)\n    \n    code_blocks = findall(x -> x isa CodeBlock, parsed_md))\n    \n    code_content = map(code_blocks) do cb\n        join([cb.content; \"\\n\"]...), String\n    end\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_content, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nWith this implementation, you can call `extract_julia_code` on your markdown document, and it will return the combined Julia code blocks as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":3.401532247,"_type":"aimessage"}]
