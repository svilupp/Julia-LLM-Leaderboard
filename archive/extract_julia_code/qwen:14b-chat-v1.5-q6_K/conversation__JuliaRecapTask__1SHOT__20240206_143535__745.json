[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use Julia's built-in functions for parsing markdown. Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    parsed_md = parse/markdown(md);\n    \n    code_blocks = filter(x -> isa(x.content, String)), parsed_md.elements);\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    julia_code = join([block.content[3:end-3]] for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\");\n    \n    return julia_code;\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown string into a structured representation. Then it filters out only the code blocks containing Julia code (indicated by code fences starting with triple backticks). Finally, it removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that all code blocks starting with triple backticks are written in Julia. If there could be other languages or invalid code blocks, you might need to add additional checks or filtering criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[0,215],"elapsed":4.136414411,"_type":"aimessage"}]
