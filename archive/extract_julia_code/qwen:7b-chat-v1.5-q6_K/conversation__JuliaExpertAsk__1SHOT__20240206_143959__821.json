Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    lines = String[]\n    \n    # Find all code blocks in markdown\n    block_matches = replaceall(md, \"\\n```julia\\n(.*)\\n```\\n\", \"\\\\1\")\n\n    # Extract lines of code without fences\n    for block in split(block_matches, \"\\n\"))\n        lines += join(String.split(block, \"\\n\"), \"\")) * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines)\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document (`md`) as input. It finds all the code blocks containing Julia language by searching for triple backticks (`\\n```julia\\n(.*)\\n```\\n`) and replaces them with just the content.\n\nThen, it extracts each line of code (without the fences) from these replacement blocks and appends them to a `lines` array.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the lines in the `lines` array together with a newline character (`'\\n'`), and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":2.636908104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
