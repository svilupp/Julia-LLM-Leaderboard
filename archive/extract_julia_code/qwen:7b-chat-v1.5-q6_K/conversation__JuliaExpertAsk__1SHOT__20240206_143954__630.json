It uses regular expressions to find all the code blocks containing Julia language. Then it removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nFinally, it returns the extracted Julia code as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":2.119284976,"_type":"aimessage"}]
