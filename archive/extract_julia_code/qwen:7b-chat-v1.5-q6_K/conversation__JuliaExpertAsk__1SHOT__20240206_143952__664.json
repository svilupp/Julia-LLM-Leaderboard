Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = split(replace(md, \"```julia\", \"\"), \"```\", \"\\n\"), \"\\n\"\n    \n    joined_codes = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return joined_codes\nend\n```\n\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document `md` as input. It first splits the markdown into separate code blocks based on the presence of triple backticks (```julia```) and empty lines.\n\nThen it joins these code blocks together with a newline character, forming a single string.\n\nFinally, it returns this joined string as the result of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,136],"elapsed":1.626062191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
