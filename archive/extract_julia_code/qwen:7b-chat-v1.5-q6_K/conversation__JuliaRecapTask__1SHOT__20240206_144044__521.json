[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = Regex(r'^`{3}(.*?)\\n```).allmatches(md)\n\n    extracted_code = join(map(str, match[1])) for match in code_blocks) * \"\\n\"\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n1. The `extract_julia_code` function takes the input markdown document `md` as input.\n2. It uses a regular expression `r'^`{3}(.*?)\\n```) to match all the code blocks in the markdown. This regex matches triple backticks (````) around the Julia code block, followed by any characters (the `(.*?)`) and a line break `\\n`.\n3. The `allmatches` method returns an array of matched groups for each match in the input string.\n4. We join the code snippets in each match using `join(map(str, match[1]))))`, convert them to strings with `str`, and then append them together.\n5. Finally, we return the extracted Julia code as a single string.\n\nThis function will extract all valid Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document, remove the code fences, and join the blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":3.024021198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
