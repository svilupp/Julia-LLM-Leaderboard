Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    extracted_codes = split(replace(md, \"```jl\\n\", \"\"\"), \"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\"), \"\\n\")\n    \n    joined_codes = join(extracted_codes, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return joined_codes\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document `md` as input. It uses regular expressions to extract all code blocks marked with triple backticks (```jl\\n```) and removes the code fences.\n\nNext, it replaces consecutive blank lines (`\\n\\n`) with a single newline (`\\n`). This ensures that multiple code blocks are joined together correctly.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.964790142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
