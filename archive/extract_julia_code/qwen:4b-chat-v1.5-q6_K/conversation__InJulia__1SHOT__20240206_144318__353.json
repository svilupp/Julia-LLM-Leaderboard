It then loops through each line in the markdown document. For each line, it checks if the current line starts with a backslash. If it does, it skips over the backslash character and continues processing the remaining characters in the line. Otherwise, it extracts the code block that follows immediately after this line using the `extract_code_block` function defined earlier. It then joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline and adds them to the `extracted_code` string. Finally, the function returns the `extracted_code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.819217418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
