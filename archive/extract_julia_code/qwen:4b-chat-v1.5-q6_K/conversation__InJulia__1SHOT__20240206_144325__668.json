The function first splits the `md` string into an array of lines using Julia's built-in `splitlines()` function. \n\nThe function then splits each line in the resulting array of lines using another Julia function called `split` with the default option value of `\":\"`. This results in an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a single line in the Markdown document.\n\nOnce the code blocks have been extracted from the Markdown document, the function joins them together with a newline using Julia's built-in `join()` function with the default option value of `\"\":\"\"`. \n\nFinally, the function returns the resulting string representing the extracted Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.206260762,"_type":"aimessage"}]
