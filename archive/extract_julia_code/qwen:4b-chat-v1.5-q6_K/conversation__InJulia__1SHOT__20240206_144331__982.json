It then extracts all the code fence blocks from the Julia blocks. Finally, it joins the code fence blocks together with a newline character, and joins the Julia block code together with another newline character. The resulting string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,161],"elapsed":1.513438619,"_type":"aimessage"}]
