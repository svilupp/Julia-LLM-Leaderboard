Define the `extract_julia_code` function that takes a string `md` as input.\n2. Use regular expressions to find code blocks in the markdown string.\n3. Extract and process each code block separately.\n4. Combine all processed code blocks with newlines.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for matching code blocks\n    pattern = r\"(?<=\\`\\`)(.*?)(?=\\`\\`)\"\n\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown string\n    code_blocks = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n    # Process each code block and combine them with newlines\n    processed_code = join(process_block(code_block)) for code_block in code_blocks)\n    \n    return processed_code\nend\n\nfunction process_block(block::String)\n    # Remove code fences from the code block\n    no_fences = replace(block, r\"^\\`\\`(.+?)\\`\\`$\", \"\\1\")\n\n    # Return the code without fences\n    return no_fences\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call the `extract_julia_code` function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nmd_example = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_example)\nprintln(extracted_code)  # Output: println(\"hello world\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":4.877825217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
