It then filters out the non-Julia code blocks and removes the trailing newline character from each block (if present).\n\nFinally, it joins all the processed code blocks together with a newline character between them and returns this concatenated String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,180],"elapsed":10.323339112,"_type":"aimessage"}]
