It splits the markdown into separate blocks and iterates through them to identify Julia code blocks.\n\nIf a block starts with \"```julia\" or \"```jl\", it is considered a Julia code block. The function removes the code fence and adds the cleaned-up block to an array of Julia code.\n\nFinally, all the collected Julia code blocks are joined together with two newline characters between each block. This concatenated string is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":12.604450338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
