It first splits the input into lines, then filters out the code fence lines for Julia code blocks.\n\nNext, it iterates through the lines and appends non-code fence lines within the identified Julia code blocks to an array `code_lines`.\n\nOnce all the relevant code lines are collected, they're joined together with a newline character. The resulting string is then returned after removing any remaining code fence occurrences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":13.214341975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
