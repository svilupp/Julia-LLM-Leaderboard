[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Solve the Task: Write a function `extract_julia_code` that follows the described requirements.\n3. Double-check the solution: Test the function with various inputs to ensure it correctly extracts and formats julia language code blocks.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*)\\n```\", md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks with a newline\n    extracted_code = join(replace.(code_blocks, r\"```julia\\n|\\n```\" => \"\\n\"), \"\")\n    \n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nYou can now use this function to extract julia language code blocks from markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":12.364346192,"_type":"aimessage"}]
