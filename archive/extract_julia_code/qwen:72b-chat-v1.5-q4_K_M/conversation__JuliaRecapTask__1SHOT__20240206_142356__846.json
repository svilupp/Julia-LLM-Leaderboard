[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It first splits the markdown document into individual lines.\n\nA variable `julia_code` is initialized to store the extracted Julia code blocks, and a boolean flag `inside_code_block` is used to determine whether we are currently inside a Julia code block.\n\nThe function then iterates over each line in the markdown document, checking for the start or end of a Julia code block. If we find ourselves inside a code block, we remove any leading \"```julia\" and append the cleaned line to our `julia_code` string, followed by a newline character.\n\nOnce all lines have been processed, the function returns the collected Julia code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":15.448671027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
