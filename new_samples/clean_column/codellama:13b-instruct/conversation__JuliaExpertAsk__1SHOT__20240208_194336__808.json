The `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character and `_` matches an underscore, so this ensures that only spaces and hyphens are replaced with underscores.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the column names are not already in lowercase. If they are, you can remove the `lowercase` call.","status":200,"tokens":[125,187],"elapsed":4.605003794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
