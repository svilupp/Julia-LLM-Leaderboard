[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)::String\n    # 1. Lowercase the column name\n    lower = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # 2. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    strip = lstrip(rstrip(lower))\n    \n    # 3. Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    replace_spaces = replace(strip, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return replace_spaces\nend\n```\n\n# Testing the function\n\nWe can test the `clean_column` function using the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@test clean_column(\"My Column\") == \"my_column\"\n@test clean_column(\"My-Column\") == \"my_column\"\n@test clean_column(\" My Column \") == \"my_column\"\n@test clean_column(\"My - Column\") == \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe `@test` macro is used to define a test case, and the `==` operator is used to check if the actual result (the return value of the function) is equal to the expected result. If all tests pass, we know that our function works correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[202,272],"elapsed":6.703301195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
