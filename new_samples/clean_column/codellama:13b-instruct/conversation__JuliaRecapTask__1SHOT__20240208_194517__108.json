[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task, using Julia language:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `replace` is used to replace any spaces or hyphens in the column name with an underscore. The first argument of `replace` is the string to be modified, and the second argument is a regular expression that matches the characters to be replaced (in this case, any space or hyphen). The third argument is the replacement string, which in this case is just an underscore.\n* `strip` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name.\n* `lowercase` is used to convert the column name to lowercase.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input column names are all strings, and will not work for columns with other data types. If you need to handle columns of different data types, you may need to use a different approach.","status":200,"tokens":[387,225],"elapsed":5.871785513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
