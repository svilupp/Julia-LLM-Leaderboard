It uses the `replace` function to replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore, and then applies the `lowercase` function to convert the resulting string to lowercase. Finally, it uses the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all column names are strings, and it will not work if the input is a vector of column names. If you need to clean multiple columns at once, you can use the `replace` function in combination with `map` to apply the same operation to each element of the array.","status":200,"tokens":[125,187],"elapsed":4.598292467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
