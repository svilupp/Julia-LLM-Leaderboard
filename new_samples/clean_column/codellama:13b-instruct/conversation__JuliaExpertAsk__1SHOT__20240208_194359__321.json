The resulting string is then returned by the function.\n\nNote that this implementation uses regular expressions to match any space or hyphen character in the input column name, and replaces them with an underscore. You can adjust the regular expression pattern as needed to suit your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[125,229],"elapsed":5.542548096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
