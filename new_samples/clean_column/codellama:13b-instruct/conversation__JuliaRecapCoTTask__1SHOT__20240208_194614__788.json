[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = lowercase(strip(col))\n    \n    # Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\", \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function first takes a column name as input `col` of type `AbstractString`, which is the most general string type in Julia that covers both `String` and `SubString`. It then lowers the case of the column name using `lowercase(strip())` to convert any uppercase characters to lowercase, and also removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name. Finally, it replaces any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using the `replace()` function, which searches for a pattern `[ -]` (i.e., a space or a hyphen) in the input string and replaces them with an underscore.\n\nThe output of this function is a cleaned-up column name that can be used as a valid variable name in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[390,251],"elapsed":6.491305998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
