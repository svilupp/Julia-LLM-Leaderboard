[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[- ]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThe `clean_column` function takes in a string `col` and applies the following transformations to it:\n- The entire string is converted to lowercase using `lowercase()`.\n- Any leading or trailing whitespaces are removed by `strip()`, which can be done for efficiency reasons as we don't have to iterate through all the characters in the string.\n- All spaces and hyphens are replaced with underscores using `replace(col, r\"[- ]\" => \"_\")`. The regular expression `r\"[- ]\"` matches any character that is either a space or a hyphen. \n\nSo if we call this function on the string \"My Column\", it will return \"my_column\", which meets your requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":6.043844731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
