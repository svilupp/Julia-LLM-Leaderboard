Import any necessary packages.\n2. Create a function called `clean_column` that takes in a column name as an argument.\n3. Within the function, convert the column name to lowercase using the `lowercase()` method.\n4. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name using string manipulation.\n5. Replace any spaces and hyphens with underscores by iterating over each character in the modified column name and replacing occurrences of '-' and ' ' (or spaces) with '_'.\n6. Return the cleaned column name as a lowercase string.\n7. Test the function with the provided input \"My Column\" using `clean_column(\"My Column\")`.\n8. Verify that the output is \"my_column\", indicating that the task was completed successfully.\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Import any necessary packages\nusing Base.Test # for testing the function\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Create a function called `clean_column` that takes in a column name as an argument and converts it to lowercase\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return lowercase(col)\nend\n\n# Step 4, 5 & 6: Modify the function by adding additional steps to strip leading/trailing whitespaces and replace spaces/hyphens with underscores\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    lowercased = lowercase(col)\n    stripped = replace(lowercased, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\" => \"\")\n    cleaned = replace(stripped, [r\"-\", r\"\\s\"] => \"_\")\n    return cleaned\nend\n\n# Step 7: Test the function with the provided input \"My Column\"\n@test clean_column(\"My Column\") == \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe above code fulfills all the requirements of the task, and the `clean_column` function is now ready to be used for cleaning column names in your Julia programs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":13.361121904,"_type":"aimessage"}]
