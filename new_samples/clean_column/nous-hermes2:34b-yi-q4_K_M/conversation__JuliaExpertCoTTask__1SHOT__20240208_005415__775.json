Then, it strips any leading or trailing whitespaces by calling `strip()` on the modified string. Finally, it replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores using `replace(col, [\" \" => \"_\", \"-\" => \"_\"])`.\n\nThe function successfully converts \"My Column\" to \"my_column\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":5.798830772,"_type":"aimessage"}]
