It first converts all characters to lowercase using the `lower()` method and strips any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip()`. It then replaces any spaces in the cleaned string with underscores using the `replace(' ', '_')` method, and does the same for hyphens. The function finally returns the cleaned column name as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,164],"elapsed":4.643051974,"_type":"aimessage"}]
