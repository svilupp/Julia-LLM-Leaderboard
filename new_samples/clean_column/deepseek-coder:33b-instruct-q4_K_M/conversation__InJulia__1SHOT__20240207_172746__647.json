So, if we want to apply both replacements at once, we need two calls to replace. \n\nIn Julia, strings are immutable which means they cannot be changed after their creation. Instead of modifying existing string, `replace` function creates a new string and keeps original intact. This behavior is common in many languages including Julia, Python and R.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":7.203168618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
