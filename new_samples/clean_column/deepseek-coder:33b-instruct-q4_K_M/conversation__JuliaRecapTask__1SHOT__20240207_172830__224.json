[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function named `clean_column` that performs the specified operations on a given column name string (`col`):\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    cleaned = lowercase(strip(replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")))\n    replace(cleaned, \"-\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by using the `lowercase` function to convert all characters in the string to their lower-case equivalents, then `strip` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string. The `replace` function is then used twice: once to replace spaces with underscores and a second time to replace hyphens with underscores.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\ncol = \"My Column\"\nclean_column(col) # returns \"my_column\"\n``` \n\nThis code assumes that the input `col` is an AbstractString type (i.e., it could be a string or any other subtype of AbstractString). If you need to handle other types, you can add additional methods for these types accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":7.21825109,"_type":"aimessage"}]
