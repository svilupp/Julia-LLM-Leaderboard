The `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace` functions are built-in Julia functions that perform lowercasing, stripping of whitespace, and replacement of characters respectively. You can use this function on any column name you want to clean in your data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":5.406640088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
