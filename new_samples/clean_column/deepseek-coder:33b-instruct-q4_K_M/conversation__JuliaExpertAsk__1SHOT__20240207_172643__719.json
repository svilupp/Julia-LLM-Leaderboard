Here is how you could define your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    col = lowercase(col)  # Lower case the column name\n    col = strip(col)  # Remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, ' ' => '_')  # Replace spaces with underscores\n    col = replace(col, '-' => '_')  # Replace hyphens with underscores\n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function will take a string input (column name) and return the cleaned version according to your specifications. Please note that Julia is case-sensitive so it treats \"my_column\" and \"My Column\" as different strings. If you want them to be treated the same, you should lowercase or uppercase everything before comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.220872899,"_type":"aimessage"}]
