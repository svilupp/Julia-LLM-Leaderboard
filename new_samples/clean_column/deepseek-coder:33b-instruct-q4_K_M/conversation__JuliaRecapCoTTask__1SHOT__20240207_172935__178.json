[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function `clean_column` as per your request. This function uses built-in methods such as `lowercase`, `strip` and `replace` to clean up a column name string. \n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col) # make the column name lower case\n    col = strip(col)     # remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\") # replace spaces with underscores\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\") # replace hyphens with underscores\n    return col \nend\n```\nYou can test this function using the following code:\n\n```julia\ncol = \" My-Column \"\nprintln(\"Cleaned column name: \", clean_column(col))\n# Output: cleaned_column\n```\n\nThe `clean_column` function takes a string as an argument, processes it according to your rules and returns the cleaned up version. It can handle any string (not only ASCII strings) because of the use of the abstract type `AbstractString`. Note that this code assumes you are working with Julia 1.0 or later which is required for using the AbstractString type. If you're using an earlier version of Julia, replace `AbstractString` with `String`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":8.580866505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
