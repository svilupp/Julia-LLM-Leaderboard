Here's how you could define a function that accomplishes what you want:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString) \n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string (`col`), converts it to all lower case, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores. The cleaned string is then returned. \n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\nprint(clean_column(\" My-Column \")) # Outputs: \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[109,192],"elapsed":5.564515077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
