It first converts all characters in the string to lowercase using the `lowercase` function. Then, it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces with the `strip` function. After that, it replaces any space character with an underscore using the `replace` function. Finally, it also replaces any hyphen character with an underscore using the same `replace` function. The cleaned column name is then returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":4.637031124,"_type":"aimessage"}]
