The `lowercase` function is used to lower all the letters in the string. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces. Then both spaces and hyphens are replaced with an underscore using the `replace` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,152],"elapsed":4.138775598,"_type":"aimessage"}]
