Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ErrorException(\"The provided timestamp must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThen you can test the function using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)) # Returns 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThis code will throw an error if you try to use it with a Date type:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)) # Throws ErrorException\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.31541012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
