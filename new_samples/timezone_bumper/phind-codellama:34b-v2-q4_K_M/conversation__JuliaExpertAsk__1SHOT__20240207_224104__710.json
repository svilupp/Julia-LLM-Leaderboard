Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function definition in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Function only works with DateTime types, not Date types\"))\n    else\n        throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (dt, bump)))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is the datetime object that you want to increase. `bump` (which defaults to 3) is the number of hours that you want to increase the datetime object by.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is an instance of `DateTime`. If it is, it adds `bump` hours to `dt` and returns the result.\n\nIf `dt` is not a `DateTime`, the function next checks if `dt` is a `Date`. If it is, it throws an error message saying \"Function only works with DateTime types, not Date types\".\n\nFinally, if `dt` is neither a `DateTime` nor a `Date`, the function throws a `MethodError`, which is a kind of error that occurs when a function is called with an incorrect method signature. This ensures that the `timezone_bumper` function can only be called with arguments of the correct types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":8.740876654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
