This module provides functionality for working with dates and periods. The `DateTime` type in this module represents a specific point in time.\n\nHere's how you can define the function `timezone_bumper`:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates  # You need to import this module to work with DateTime\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        error(\"The provided timestamp should be of type `DateTime`, not `Date`.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)  # Adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime\n    end\nend\n```\nNow let's test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 3)  # This should return a DateTime object corresponding to April 10, 2023 at 15:00\n```\n\nThis function increases the given `DateTime` by `bump` hours. If the provided timestamp is of type `Date`, it throws an error because this function works only with `DateTime` types. The default value for `bump` is set to `3` if it's not provided.","status":200,"tokens":[203,307],"elapsed":8.689182767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
