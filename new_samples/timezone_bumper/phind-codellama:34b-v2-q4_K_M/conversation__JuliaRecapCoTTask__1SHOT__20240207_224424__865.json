[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following Julia function satisfies the Task and Special Instructions:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = throw(\"The input is a Date type. Only DateTime types are supported.\")\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which can be either a `DateTime` or a `Date`, and `bump` which is an integer representing the number of hours to add (defaulting to 3). If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours. If `dt` is a `Date`, it throws an error because only `DateTime` types are supported.\n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1) # 2022-01-01T00:00:00\nbump = 5\n\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\nprintln(\"New DateTime: \", new_dt) # 2022-01-01T05:00:00\n```\n\nThis code increases the timestamp `2022-01-01T00:00:00` by 5 hours and prints the result. If you try to use a `Date` type, an error will be thrown as expected:\n\n```julia\ndt = Date(2022, 1, 1) # 2022-01-01\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":10.910858992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
