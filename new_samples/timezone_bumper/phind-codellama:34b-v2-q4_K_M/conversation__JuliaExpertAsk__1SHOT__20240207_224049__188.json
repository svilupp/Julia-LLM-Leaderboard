This function checks whether the provided `dt` is of type DateTime, if not it throws an error.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = throw(ArgumentError(\"The provided timestamp must be of type DateTime.\"))\n```\n\nIn the above code, `Hour` is a Dates.Period that represents the number of hours. When you add this to a DateTime, it increments the DateTime by the specified number of hours. \n\nPlease note that you need to use `DateTime` from `Dates` package for this function to work. Here's an example usage:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 11, 26, 15, 30)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 2)) # Outputs: 2021-11-26T17:30:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,291],"elapsed":8.087568571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
