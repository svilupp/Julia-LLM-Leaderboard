[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2022, 1, 1), 5)  # This line should throw an error\n```\nThis function increases the given timestamp (of type DateTime) by `bump` hours. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function throws a MethodError if the provided timestamp is of type Date, because DateTime is required for this operation.\n\nTo throw an error for Date types and allow only DateTime types, we can define two versions of the function - one for each type:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) = dt + Hour(bump)  # Increases a DateTime by bump hours.\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(date::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (date, bump)))\nend\n```\nThe first function increases a DateTime by `bump` hours, as before. The second function throws an error if the user tries to use it with a Date. This way, the function will work only for DateTime types and throw an error for Date types, as specified in the task description.","status":200,"tokens":[376,313],"elapsed":8.997050862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
