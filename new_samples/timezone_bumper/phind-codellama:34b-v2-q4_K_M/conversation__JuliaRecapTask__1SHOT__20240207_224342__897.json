[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia function that satisfies the problem requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = throw(\"Function works only for DateTime types.\")\n```\nIn this function, we use the `Dates` module from Julia's standard library to handle date and time values. The `DateTime` type represents a specific point in time, while the `Date` type represents a date without a specific time. We also make use of the `Hour` function to add the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime`.\n\nIf we call the function with a `Date` value and an optional integer as the second argument, it will throw an error. Note that in Julia, functions can be overloaded to provide different implementations for different types of arguments. In this case, the `timezone_bumper` function is overloaded to handle both `DateTime` and `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.591772223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
