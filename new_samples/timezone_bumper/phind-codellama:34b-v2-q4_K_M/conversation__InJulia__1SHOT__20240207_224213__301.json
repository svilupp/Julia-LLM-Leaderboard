If it is, it adds the specified number of hours to the given date time. If the input type is `Date`, it throws an error, because the function is designed to work only with `DateTime` objects. \n\nNote that you need to use the Dates stdlib for this solution to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":4.442113043,"_type":"aimessage"}]
