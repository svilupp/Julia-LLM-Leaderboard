Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can start by defining the function `timezone_bumper` with two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. The argument `dt` should be of type `DateTime` and `bump` should be of type `Int`. You can use the `isa` function to check the type of the input. If the input is not of the correct type, throw an error using the `error` function.\n\nThe function should return a new `DateTime` object that results from adding `bump` hours to `dt`. You can use the `Hour` period from the `Dates` module to add hours to a `DateTime` object. \n\nHere's how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be of type DateTime\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n```julia\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nAs you can see, the timestamp has been increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":8.827636927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
