Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt + Hour(bump) > now()  # Check if updated time is later than current time\n        return dt + Hour(bump)  # Return the updated DateTime\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The bump operation results in a past DateTime.\"))\n    end\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (dt, bump)))\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which can be either a `DateTime` or `Date` type and `bump`, an integer specifying the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. \n\nIf `dt` is of `DateTime` type, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours and returns it. If that updated time is later than the current time. However, if updating the timestamp would result in a past time, it throws an error instead.\n\nIf `dt` is of `Date` type, it simply throws an error because we specifically want this function to work only with `DateTime` types. \n\nThe function's second argument `bump` is set to default at +3 hours if the user does not provide a custom value. \n\nPlease note that you should always be careful when working with dates and times, especially when dealing with time zones, as they can often cause unexpected results due to daylight saving adjustments etc.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":9.856219595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
