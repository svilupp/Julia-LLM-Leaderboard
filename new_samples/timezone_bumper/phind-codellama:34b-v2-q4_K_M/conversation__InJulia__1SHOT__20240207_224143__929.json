Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way of implementing the desired function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = throw(ArgumentError(\"Function works only for DateTime types. A Date type was provided.\"))\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and `bump` of type `Int`. The function returns a new `DateTime` value which is the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`. \n\nNext, we overload our function for the case when the first argument is of type `Date`. In this case, we throw an `ArgumentError` with a custom error message. This ensures that our function will work correctly only with instances of `DateTime`, and any attempt to use it with `Date` objects will result in an error. \n\nPlease note that the `Hour(bump)` part is responsible for converting the integer value of `bump` into a period of time in hours, which can then be added to `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.678938969,"_type":"aimessage"}]
