This function should work only for DateTime types and throw an error if used on Date type.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem:\n\nFirst, let's import the required package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\nNow, let's define our function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, we are taking a DateTime type variable `dt` and an integer `bump` as input with a default value of 3. We then add the number of hours specified in `bump` to `dt`.\n\nFinally, let's check that our solution works correctly:\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3))\n```\nIf our function is implemented correctly, this code should print \"2023-04-10T15:00:00\".\n\nNow, if we try to use Date type with the function, it should throw an error. Let's check this:\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10),3))\n```\nThis code should give an error because our function is designed to work only with DateTime type and not Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":9.810868068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
