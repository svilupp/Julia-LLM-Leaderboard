If the Int is not provided, it defaults to 3 (as specified in the problem). The function then adds the specified number of hours to the given DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nThe function will work only for DateTime types and throws an error if used with Date types because Hour(bump) is not defined for Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":4.97608722,"_type":"aimessage"}]
