[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We need to first check whether the provided input is of DateTime type or not. If it's not a DateTime then throw an error message. Then add the bump (which is by default set to 3 hours) to the provided DateTime.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2022,1,1), 5)\n```\n\nThis will throw an error saying:\n\n```julia\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date, ::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  timezone_bumper(!Matched::DateTime, !Matched::Int64) at none:1\nStacktrace:\n [1] top-level scope at none:0\n```\n\nThis is because our function `timezone_bumper` is specifically designed to work with DateTime type and not with Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":7.54641126,"_type":"aimessage"}]
