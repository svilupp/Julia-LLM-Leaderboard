Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3) = error(\"Function only works for DateTime types, not Date types\")\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is the datetime object that you want to modify. `bump` (which defaults to 3 if not provided) is the number of hours that you want to add to `dt`. The function returns a new DateTime object that has been adjusted by the specified number of hours.\n\nThe second line of the function definition adds `bump` hours to `dt`. This is achieved using the `Hour` function from the Dates module, which constructs a Dates.CompoundPeriod type representing a period of time in hours.\n\nThe third line defines a separate behavior for the function when it receives a Date object as input. In this case, an error message is thrown, since the function has been designed to work specifically with DateTime objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":7.144434652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
