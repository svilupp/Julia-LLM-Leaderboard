If it's a DateTime, it will increase the timestamp by `bump` hours (default is +3 hours) and return the new DateTime. If the input is Date, an error message is thrown indicating that this function works only for DateTime types.\n\nNote: You may want to handle negative values of `bump` as well in case you need them. In the current implementation, a negative value of `bump` will cause an overflow and return a DateTime with an incorrect timezone.","status":200,"tokens":[72,213],"elapsed":6.326506125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
