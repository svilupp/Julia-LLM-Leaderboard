X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- `DateTime` from the Dates package to handle timestamps with timezone information\n- `Dates.value(dt)` and `Dates.hour(dt)` to extract the timestamp in seconds and hours, respectively\n- `isless(a, b) == true` checks if `a` is less than `b`\n- `@error` macro for throwing custom errors\n\n2. Solve the Task\n\n```julia\n# Import necessary packages\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime{T}, bump::Int = 3) where T <: TimeZone\n    # Extract timestamp in seconds and hours\n    seconds = value(dt)\n    hours = hour(dt)\n\n    # Check if input type is DateTime (with TimeZone information) or Date (without it)\n    if !(T <: TimeZone)\n        @error \"The provided `dt` should be of type DateTime, not $(typeof(dt))\"\n    end\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by the given bump in hours\n    new_seconds = seconds + (bump * 3600)\n    new_hours = mod1(hours + bump) # ensure hours don't overflow or go negative\n    return DateTime(new_seconds, hour(dt)) # reconstruct with new hours and original minutes/seconds\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` checks if the input type is of `DateTime` (with TimeZone information) and throws an error for any other types, including `Date`. It then extracts the timestamp in seconds and hours from the provided DateTime object. The given `bump::Int` value is added to the total number of seconds, and the new hour value is calculated by adding `bump` and ensuring it does not overflow or go negative. Finally, a new DateTime object with the updated timezone information is created using the new hours and original minutes/seconds from the input DateTime.\n\nIf there are any remaining Special Instructions that were not provided in this prompt, please provide them to ensure a complete solution.","status":200,"tokens":[0,496],"elapsed":14.733206106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
