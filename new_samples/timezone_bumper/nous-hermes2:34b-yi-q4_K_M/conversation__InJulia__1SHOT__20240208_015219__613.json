For Date types, use the `Date` or `DateTime` constructors with a timezone offset to convert them first.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis implementation will work as expected, increasing any provided timestamp by the specified number of hours (defaulting to +3 hours). It is also robust enough to throw an error if it receives a Date type and provides advice on how to handle Date types correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":5.396408998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
