We want `dt` to be any type that can be converted to DateTime (`Union{DateTime, Date}`), but we also want it to return a DateTime object (`<: DateTime`). The same goes for `bump`, which is an integer. This means that we need two `<:` statements.\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::T, bump::Int) where {T <: Union{DateTime, Date}} where {S <: Int}\n    # code goes here\nend\n```\n\nNow we can add the function body. We need to check if `dt` is a `Date`, and if so convert it to `DateTime`. Then we will increase `dt` by `bump` hours, and return it as DateTime object. We do this by first creating a vector of three timestamps (`years, months, days`) that represents the date part of `dt`, then create a vector of three timestamps (`hours, minutes, seconds`) that represent the time part of `dt`. Then we will add `bump` hours to the latter, and convert it back to DateTime.\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::T, bump::Int) where {T <: Union{DateTime, Date}} where {S <: Int}\n    if dt isa Date\n        dt = DateTime(Dates.Date(yearmonthday(dt)...))\n    end\n\n    years, months, days = yearmonthday(dt)\n    hours, minutes, seconds = hour(dt), minute(dt), second(dt) + bump * 3600 # convert to Int and add bump hours\n    DateTime(years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds)\nend\n```\n\n## Test\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(date1, 5) # throws MethodError: no method matching +(::Date, ::Int64)\ntimezone_bumper(date2, bump) # throws MethodError: no method matching +(::Date, ::Int64)\ntimezone_bumper(time_stamp1, 5) # 2020-01-03T22:00:00\ntimezone_bumper(time_stamp2, bump) # 2020-01-06T01:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,679],"elapsed":18.61476631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
