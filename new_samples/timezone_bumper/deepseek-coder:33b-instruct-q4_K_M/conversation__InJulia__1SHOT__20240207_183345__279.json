We then call our function `timezone_bumper` with this date and the integer 5 as arguments. The function should return a new DateTime object that is 5 hours later than the input.\n\nIn the second test case, we try to pass in a Date object instead of a DateTime object. This should cause an error because our function only works for DateTime objects, not Date objects. We catch this error and print it out using `showerror`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":8.416764854,"_type":"aimessage"}]
