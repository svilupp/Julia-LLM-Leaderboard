Input must be DateTime.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments, a date-time object `dt` and an integer `bump` (defaults to 3). It first checks if the type of `dt` is `Date`. If so, it throws an error message as DateTime types are expected here. Otherwise, it increments `dt` by `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour(bump)` constructor.\n\nLet's test the function with provided data:\n```julia\nusing Dates\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nExpected output: `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":7.472375718,"_type":"aimessage"}]
