When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The default value of the bump parameter is 3 which means that if it's not provided, it will increase the time by 3 hours. The Hour type from Dates package is used to specify the number of hours.\n\nThis way you can use this function with DateTime and Date types:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3) # returns 2023-04-10T15:00:00\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10))              # throws an error \"Date type is not supported\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.979650346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
