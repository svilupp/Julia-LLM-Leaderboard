If it's not provided, it will default to 3.\n- The first function definition takes a DateTime object and an integer as arguments, and returns the date/time increased by the specified amount. If `bump` isn't given, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- The second function definition throws an error for any Date objects. It doesn't use `bump` because we want it to always throw an error, regardless of its value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":6.807894973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
