[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia that does what you want:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis function will add hours to a DateTime type object, but will throw an error if the input is of Date type. The `bump` parameter has a default value of 3 which means that it adds 3 hours by default when the second argument is not provided while calling this function.\n\nPlease note that Julia does not directly support Date types without time component. So, you have to convert your date into DateTime first or use Temporal.jl package if you need to work with dates and times separately. For example:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, Temporal\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(TDate(2023, 4, 10)),3)\n```\nThis code will convert your Date type into DateTime before applying the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.353919612,"_type":"aimessage"}]
