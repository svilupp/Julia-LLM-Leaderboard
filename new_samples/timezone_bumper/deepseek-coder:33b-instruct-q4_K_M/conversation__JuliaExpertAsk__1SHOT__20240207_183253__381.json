This function only works for DateTime types.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, I'm first checking if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is, then I increase it by `bump` hours and return the new `DateTime` object. \n\nIf `dt` is a `Date` type, an error message is thrown with a custom message that says this function only works for DateTime types. Please note that in Julia, you can't use throw keyword outside of try/catch block so I used `error()` instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,210],"elapsed":5.928642954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
