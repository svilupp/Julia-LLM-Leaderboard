[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please note that this function will increase `dt` by `bump` hours only if `dt` is of type DateTime, else it will throw an error. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"The provided date is not a DateTime type. Please provide DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime` and then increases it by `bump` hours using the `+` operator with an instance of the `Hour` period from Dates package. If the input `dt` is not a `DateTime`, it throws an error.\n\nPlease ensure that your Julia environment has the necessary packages installed before running this function. If you're getting errors related to missing packages, install them using Pkg.add(\"PackageName\"). \n\nPlease also note that Julia's Dates package does not come pre-installed in every version of Julia and may require installing separately as a user requirement (it's used here for the DateTime type).","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":8.258174799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
