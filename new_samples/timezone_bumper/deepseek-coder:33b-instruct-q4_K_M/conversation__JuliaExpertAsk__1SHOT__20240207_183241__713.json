If it is, it adds the specified number (or 3 if no argument is provided) of hours to the DateTime object and returns the result. If `dt` is a Date object instead, an error is thrown because the function does not support this type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":5.445916549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
