If the input is of Date type, it throws an error because this function only supports DateTime type inputs. \n\nNote: The `error(\"This function does not support Date types.\")` line will throw an error with a message \"This function does not support Date types.\" when the provided date is not a DateTime type. This will help to prevent unexpected behavior from happening if someone tries to use this function on a Date object which it was not designed for.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.444160655,"_type":"aimessage"}]
