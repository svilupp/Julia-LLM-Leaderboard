Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can implement the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)::DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) !== DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"This function works only for DateTime types!\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this code:\n\n- The function `timezone_bumper` accepts two arguments, `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is the datetime that needs to be bumped. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- We use an if statement to check whether `dt` is of type DateTime. If it's not a DateTime object, we throw an ArgumentError with a custom message.\n- The datetime `dt` is incremented by the number of hours specified in `bump` using the Hour object from Dates module.\n- We then return the bumped DateTime object.\n\nPlease note that Julia's Dates module provides all the necessary tools for working with dates and times, including adding or subtracting various durations (like hours) from a DateTime. The `timezone_bumper` function doesn't handle time zones because time zones are a complex topic beyond the scope of this question.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.316234004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
