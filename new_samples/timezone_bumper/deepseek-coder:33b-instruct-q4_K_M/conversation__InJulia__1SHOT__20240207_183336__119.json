Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code snippet for the function you asked for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        error(\"Date type not supported. Please provide a DateTime type.\")\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet:\n- We first import the Dates module from Julia's standard library to use its features, such as DateTime and Hour data types. \n- Then we define our function `timezone_bumper` that takes two parameters: a datetime value (`dt`) and an integer representing the amount of hours by which you want to bump up your time (default is 3).\n- The function first checks if the input parameter `dt` is a DateTime. If it is, it increases this date by `bump` hours using the Hour data type from the Dates module and returns the new datetime value.\n- If `dt` isn't a DateTime but is a Date, an error message will be thrown indicating that this function doesn't support Date types. \n\nYou can use it as follows:\n```julia\nnow = DateTime(2019,1,1) # January 1st, 2019 at midnight\nbumped_time = timezone_bumper(now) # bumps the time by 3 hours (default)\nprintln(bumped_time) # Will print: 2019-01-01T03:00:00\n```\nRemember that in Julia, Date and DateTime are different types. A `Date` only holds a calendar date (day, month, year). On the other hand, a `DateTime` includes both a date and time (hour, minute, second). Hence, you cannot simply add an integer to a `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":12.144050209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
