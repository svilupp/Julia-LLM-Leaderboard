[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Date is not supported. Please provide a DateTime.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. We first import the `Dates` module from Julia's standard library. \n2. We define two methods for the `timezone_bumper` function. The first one takes in a `DateTime` object and an integer, and returns a new `DateTime` that is bumped by the given number of hours. If no hour is provided, it defaults to adding three hours.\n3. The second method is similar, but it only accepts `Date` objects. It throws an error if you try to use this function with a Date object, since we are not supporting Dates in this function. \n\nTo check the function:\n```julia\nprint(timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2019-03-01T17:15:00\"), 3)) # Should output \"2019-03-01T20:15:00\"\nprint(timezone_bumper(Date(\"2019-03-01\"))) # Should throw an error\n```","status":200,"tokens":[10,336],"elapsed":9.790655467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
