[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function called \"timezone_bumper\" that solves the problem as described. It takes two arguments: `dt` which should be a DateTime type, and `bump` an integer to shift the timestamp by (default value of 3). It throws an error if the input date is not DateTime or Date.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Expected DateTime type but received Date\"))\nend\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage with default bump value (3 hours)\ndateTime = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 0)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dateTime)) # Outputs: 2022-01-01T03:00:00\n\n# Example usage with custom bump value (5 hours)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dateTime, 5)) # Outputs: 2022-01-01T05:00:00\n```\n\nThis code also handles Date types and throws an error if a Date is passed to the function. It's important to note that this function only works properly for DateTime types, it won't work correctly with subtypes of DateTime such as ZonedDateTime. You might want to add support for those types if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":10.263623278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
