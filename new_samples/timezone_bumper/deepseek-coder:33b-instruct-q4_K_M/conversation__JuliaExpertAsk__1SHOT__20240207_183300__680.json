If it's a `DateTime`, we increment the time by `bump` hours and return the result. If it's a `Date`, we throw an error, stating that this function only works for DateTime types.\n\nPlease note that Julia's DateTime type doesn't account for timezones (it assumes everything is in UTC), so if you're dealing with timezone-aware timestamps and want to adjust them while preserving the timezone, you might need a more sophisticated solution, like using TimeZones.jl or similar libraries that handle timezones correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":7.77606982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
