The function checks whether the input value is of type DateTime or not, if not then an exception is thrown. If it is a DateTime, then the function will increase the time by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and return the new DateTime object.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates # Include Dates package\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    try \n        if dt isa DateTime\n            return dt + Hour(bump)\n        else\n            throw(\"Input must be a DateTime type\")\n        end\n    catch e\n        println(\"Caught an exception: $e\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNote that you should replace the `println` with your preferred error handling mechanism (like returning an error code, throwing another exception etc.) depending on how you want to handle these situations in your actual application. \n\nAlso note that this function does not handle cases where the resulting DateTime is invalid (e.g. adding a year or more to February 29th of a non-leap year). You would need additional error checking to handle such situations, which could get quite complex due to leap years and varying lengths of months.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.824758177,"_type":"aimessage"}]
