Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia provides the Dates module which can be used to perform date and time calculations. The function you asked for can be implemented as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function checks whether the input is of type `DateTime`. If it isn't, an error is thrown. Then the function returns the datetime incremented by bump hours using the `+` operator and `Hour()` constructor from Dates module. If no bump value is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nLet's test this:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2018, 5, 1)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt)) # Should print \"2018-05-01T03:00:00\"\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt, 4)) # Should print \"2018-05-01T04:00:00\"\n```\n\nNote that this function only works with `DateTime` type. If you try to use it with a `Date` type, an error will be thrown as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.671117452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
