[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It uses the Dates package of Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type, not a Date type\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments:\n- The first argument `dt` is supposed to be a DateTime object. \n- The second optional argument `bump`, defaults to 3 hours, is an integer representing the number of hours to add to the timestamp `dt`. \n\nThe function throws an error if the input `dt` is not a DateTime but instead is a Date type. If `dt` is indeed a DateTime, then it increases the time by `bump` hours and returns the new DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[399,218],"elapsed":6.661306348,"_type":"aimessage"}]
