Here is a simple function that does what you want:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"You can't use Date types with this function. Please provide a DateTime.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThe first method `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` and an optional argument `bump` (defaults to 3 hours if not provided). It returns the given DateTime increased by the bump amount.\n\nThe second method `timezone_bumper` is for `Date` types. It throws an error because we can't add hours to a Date, which is what you want to do when giving a Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":5.987057719,"_type":"aimessage"}]
