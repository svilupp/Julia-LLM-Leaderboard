[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The provided type was $(typeof(dt))\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with the test data:\n\n```julia\nprint(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3))\n```\nThis will add three hours to the provided DateTime `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)`. The result is `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which means that if you add 3 hours to `2023-04-10 12:00:00` it becomes `2023-04-10 15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":7.378076263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
