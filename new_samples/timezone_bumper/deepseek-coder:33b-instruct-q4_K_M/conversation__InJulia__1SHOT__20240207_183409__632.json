We will use the Dates package to manipulate date and time. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer as input. If the provided type is not `DateTime`, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the given `DateTime` by `bump` hours (default to 3 hours). The Dates package provides the `+` operator for adding time spans like Hours, Days etc.\n\nPlease note that this function does not take care of Daylight Saving Time transitions and does not account for any custom time zones set in your environment. For these more advanced features you may need to use a different library such as TimeZones.jl.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.313646048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
