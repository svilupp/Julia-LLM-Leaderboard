This function uses the Dates package which is part of the standard library in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works for DateTime types and not Date types.\"))\n    elseif typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The input type should be either DateTime or Date.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function checks the type of the input. If it's a `Date`, then an error is thrown because this function only works for `DateTime` types. If it's not either `DateTime` or `Date`, then another error is thrown. Otherwise, the `DateTime` value is increased by `bump` hours using the `Hour(bump)` expression and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":6.184160842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
