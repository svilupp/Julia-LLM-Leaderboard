Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if dt isa Dates.DateTime  # check whether dt is a DateTime type or not\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Dates.Date   # check whether dt is a Date type or not\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"You cannot bump date by $bump hours.\"))\n    else   # if dt is of any other type, throw an error\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Invalid input: Expected DateTime or Date, got $(typeof(dt)).\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check whether `dt` is a DateTime. If it's a DateTime, we increase the date by `bump` hours using the `+` operator on DateTime type and Dates.Hour type. \n\nIf `dt` is not a DateTime, we then check if it's a Date. We throw an ArgumentError because you cannot bump a Date by hours as dates do not contain time information.\n\nFinally, if `dt` does not match any of the previous conditions, we assume that it's some other type and throw an error. \n\nThe function will work for DateTime types but throw an error when called with Date types. The default bump value is set to +3 hours, but you can also specify a different number of hours to bump by as the second argument (i.e., `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":9.940764818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
