If it's not a `DateTime`, we throw an error. Then we simply add the provided number (or 3 if no number is provided) hours to the DateTime using the Dates package. The \"+\" operator for `Hour` and `DateTime` types in the Dates package does exactly what you want.","status":200,"tokens":[103,160],"elapsed":4.653423466,"_type":"aimessage"}]
