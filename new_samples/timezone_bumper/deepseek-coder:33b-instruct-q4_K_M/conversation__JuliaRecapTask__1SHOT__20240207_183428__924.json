[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3) \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump=3) \n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Input should be a DateTime not a Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a datetime and a bump as input. If the provided type is `DateTime`, it will increase the hours by `bump` amount. However, if the provided type is `Date`, an error message \"Input should be a DateTime not a Date\" will be thrown. \n\nThe function uses Dates module from Julia standard library which provides functionality for working with date and time types. Here, Hour(bump) constructs a timedelta of bump hours to add to the datetime. The `+` operator can be used on DateTime objects to add timedeltas. \n\nThe function is defined twice for two different types (DateTime & Date), Julia will automatically dispatch between these definitions when we call the function with an argument of a matching type.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.446171906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
