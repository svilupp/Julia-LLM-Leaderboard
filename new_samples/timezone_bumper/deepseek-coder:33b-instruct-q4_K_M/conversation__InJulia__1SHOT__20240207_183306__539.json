The `+` operation can be used with `DateTime` and `Hour` types to increase a `DateTime` by a certain number of hours.\n\nThe function throws an `ArgumentError` when given a Date rather than a DateTime. This is done using the `throw()` function which takes as argument any object that implements the `Exception` abstract type, in this case we're using an `ArgumentError`, one of the standard exceptions provided by Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[72,208],"elapsed":6.000486985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
