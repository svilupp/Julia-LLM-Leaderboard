The function adds the specified number of hours to the provided DateTime object. \n\nIf the user provides a `Date` object instead of `DateTime`, the second method is invoked which throws a `MethodError`. This ensures that the function works only with `DateTime` objects and throws an error if used with `Date` objects. The default value for `bump` (the number of hours to add) is set to 3, but can be overridden by providing a different integer value.","status":200,"tokens":[76,226],"elapsed":5.844515847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
