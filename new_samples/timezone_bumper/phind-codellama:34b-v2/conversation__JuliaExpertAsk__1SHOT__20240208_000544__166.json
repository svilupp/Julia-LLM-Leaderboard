The function first checks whether adding `bump` hours to `dt` would result in a DateTime outside the valid range. If it does, an ErrorException is thrown; otherwise, `dt` increased by `bump` hours is returned.\n\nThe second line of code defines another method for `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. This method is designed to work only with Date types (not DateTime types), as indicated by the function signature. If this method is called with a DateTime argument, a MethodError is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":7.613584421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
