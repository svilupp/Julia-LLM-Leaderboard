[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here is how you can implement the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing it out\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-06-24T08:00:00\") # This is a DateTime object\n@assert timezone_bumper(dt, 5) == DateTime(\"2021-06-24T13:00:00\")\n```\n\nThis code defines the `timezone_bumper` function. The function takes two arguments - `dt`, which should be a DateTime object, and `bump`, an integer that defaults to 3 if not provided. The function returns a new DateTime object where `bump` hours have been added to `dt`.\n\nNote that this function will throw a MethodError if you try to use it with a Date object instead of a DateTime object, because the + operator is not defined for adding hours to a Date object. This behavior matches the requirement in the problem description.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.186621437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
