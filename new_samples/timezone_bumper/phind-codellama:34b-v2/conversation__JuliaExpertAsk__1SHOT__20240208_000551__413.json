If the provided timestamp is not of DateTime type, it throws an ArgumentError.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = now()\n\n# Use the timezone_bumper function to increase the timestamp by 3 hours\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt)\n\nprintln(\"The new time is $new_time\")\n\n# This will throw an ArgumentError because Date is not a DateTime\ndate = Date(2022, 1, 1)\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(date)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":7.039638059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
