[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Please convert your Date to a DateTime.\")\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` (a date-time object) and `bump` (the number of hours you want to add to `dt`). The default value for `bump` is 3. \n\nThe function first checks if the input type is `DateTime`. If it's a `Date`, an error message will be displayed, asking the user to convert their `Date` to a `DateTime`. \n\nIf the input is a `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours (`bump`) to the given date-time (`dt`). \n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works only with `DateTime` types as required, and throws an error if a `Date` type is used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":6.327471152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
