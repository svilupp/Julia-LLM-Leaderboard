[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that satisfies the task requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt.timezone != Local && dt.timezone != FixedTimeZone(\"UTC\")\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works for DateTime types with UTC timezone\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the input `DateTime` object has a non-local and non-UTC timezone. If it does, we throw an error because the task requires working only with DateTime types. Then we simply add the number of hours specified in `bump` to the original date-time.\n\nThis function can be used like this:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 5, 17, 12, 34) # This creates a DateTime with UTC timezone by default\ndt_new = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(dt_new) # Prints \"2021-05-17T15:34:00\" which is 3 hours ahead of the original time\n```\n\nThe `DateTime` object created in this example has a UTC timezone because it lacks timezone information. If you want to make sure that the function works only with UTC datetimes, you need to create your `DateTime` objects explicitly with the FixedTimeZone(\"UTC\") parameter:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 5, 17, 12, 34, FixedTimeZone(\"UTC\")) # This creates a DateTime with UTC timezone explicitly\ndt_new = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(dt_new) # Prints \"2021-05-17T15:34:00\" which is 3 hours ahead of the original time\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":11.097029375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
