[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The `DateTime` type is part of this module, so we can directly work with it in our function. Here's an implementation following the task description:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Duration(hour = bump)\nend\n\n# To check if it works\ntimezone_bumper(now(), 5) # It should add 5 hours to the current time.\n```\nIn this implementation, we first import the `Dates` module. Then, we define our function with a default value of 3 for the `bump` parameter. Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to add a duration (specified in hours) to the input `DateTime`. The `Duration` function is part of the `Dates` module and allows us to specify durations of time in different units like hours, minutes, etc.\n\nThis function will work only with `DateTime` types and will throw an error if you try to use it with a `Date` type because `DateTime` and `Date` are distinct types in Julia's `Dates` module.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.182289142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
