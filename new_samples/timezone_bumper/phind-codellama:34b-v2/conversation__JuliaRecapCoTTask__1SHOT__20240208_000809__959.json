[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

However, we can create a simple function that adjusts the timestamp by hours using the `Dates` standard library which comes with Julia. Here is a simple version of the requested function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\ndt = DateTime(2021, 8, 19, 15, 30) # Create a DateTime type\n@show timezone_bumper(dt)          # Output: dt + 3 hours\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer number of hours to bump as input. The function checks the type of `dt` at runtime, and throws an error if it is not a `DateTime`. It then adds the specified number of hours to the given timestamp using the `Dates` library's `Hour()` constructor.\n\nPlease note that if you pass a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime`, Julia will throw an error automatically, because you cannot add hours to a date that doesn't have a time component. The function does not need explicit checking for `Date` type as this behavior is built into the language itself. \n\nThe special instructions provided by the user are not applicable in this case as they do not require any changes to the provided solution.","status":200,"tokens":[13,335],"elapsed":8.738142152,"_type":"aimessage"}]
