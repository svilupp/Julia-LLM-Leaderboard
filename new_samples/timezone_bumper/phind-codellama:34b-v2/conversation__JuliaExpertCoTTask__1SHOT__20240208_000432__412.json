It checks whether the input is of Date type, if so it throws an error message. Otherwise, it adds the specified number of hours to the given DateTime object. \n\nYou can test the function by calling it with different arguments as in the example above. The `@assert` macro is used for testing purposes here. It checks whether the output of `timezone_bumper` equals the expected result. If not, an error will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":7.577090968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
