The function then returns the result of adding the specified number of hours (`Hour(bump)`) to the input `DateTime`.\n\nNext, we define another version of `timezone_bumper` that accepts a `Date` object and an optional `Int` for the number of hours to bump. This function always throws an error, since it doesn't make sense to add hours to a date without also specifying a time. The error message indicates that this version of `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` objects.","status":200,"tokens":[106,245],"elapsed":6.344827767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
