Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in functions and the Dates standard library. Here is a simple function that does what you requested:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(\"Time only operation not valid for Date type.\")\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a DateTime object and an optional Int parameter. If the second argument isn't provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function checks if the provided date is of Date type, not DateTime. In this case, it throws an error as operation only valid for DateTime types. Otherwise, it adds the number of hours specified in `bump` to the given DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nNote that the Dates library exports a series of types (Year, Month, Day, Hour, etc.) which can be used as arguments to `+` and `-` operations on Date and DateTime objects to increment or decrement them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.036705516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
