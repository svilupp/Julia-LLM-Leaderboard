Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Function works only for DateTime types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`. The function increases the provided timestamp by `bump` hours. If `bump` is not provided, it defaults to 3 hours (as stated in your prompt). If the input is of type other than `DateTime`, the function throws an error specifying that it only works for `DateTime` types.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 8, 19, 15, 30) # create a DateTime object\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)    # add 2 hours to the timestamp\nprintln(new_dt)                   # print the new timestamp\n```\nThis will output:\n`2021-08-19T17:30:00` which is 2 hours ahead of the original time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":7.253838087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
