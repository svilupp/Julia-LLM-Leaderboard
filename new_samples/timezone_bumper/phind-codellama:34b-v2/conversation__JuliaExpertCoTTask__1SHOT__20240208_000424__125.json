The default value for `bump` is set to 3.\n\n- In the body of the function, you first check whether the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, throw an error.\n\n- If `dt` is a DateTime, then create a new DateTime by adding `bump` hours to the original DateTime `dt`. \n\nHere's how you can write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be of type DateTime\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # Output: 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThe function works as expected and increases the given timestamp by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":7.810795391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
