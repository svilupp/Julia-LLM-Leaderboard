Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that performs the operation you described:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt + Hour(bump) > now()\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The resulting DateTime must be later than now\"))\n    end\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2021, 8, 30))  # This will return 2021-08-30T03:00:00\n```\nThis function increases the provided DateTime by `bump` hours. If the resulting DateTime is earlier than the current time (`now()`), it throws an ArgumentError, because we cannot go back in time. Please note that this function will not work for Date types, as requested. Trying to use a Date type will result in an error, since the addition operation is not defined for two Dates or a Date and a TimePeriod (like Hour).\n\nHowever, if you want to include a functionality to also increase Date by `bump` hours, then you need to convert the Date to DateTime first. In such case, you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{DateTime,Date}, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt + Hour(bump) > now()\n        return DateTime(dt) + Hour(bump)  # Converts Date to DateTime then performs the operation\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The resulting DateTime must be later than now\"))\n    end\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2021, 8, 30))  # This will return a DateTime type: 2021-08-30T03:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":10.679321151,"_type":"aimessage"}]
