The integer is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to `3`.\n- Inside the function, I check whether the passed object is of type Date using the `typeof()` function. If it is, I throw an error because the function is designed to work only with DateTime objects.\n- If the passed object is a DateTime, I add the number of hours specified in `bump` to the original DateTime and return the result. The `Hour()` function is used to create a TimePeriod of the specified length in hours.\n- Finally, I test the function by passing a DateTime object and an integer to it, and print the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":7.261966789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
