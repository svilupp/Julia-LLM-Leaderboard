A Date type was supplied.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`. It defaults to adding 3 hours if no bump value is provided. If you pass in a `Date`, it will throw an error, because the function is only designed to work with `DateTime` objects. The `Hour()` function from the Dates module is used to add the specified number of hours to the supplied `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":4.344120994,"_type":"aimessage"}]
