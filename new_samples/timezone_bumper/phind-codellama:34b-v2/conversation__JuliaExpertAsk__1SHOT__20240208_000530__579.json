In this case, there's a method that accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional integer (which defaults to 3), and returns a new `DateTime` object that is the result of adding the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime`. If the function receives a `Date` object, it throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":5.099145389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
