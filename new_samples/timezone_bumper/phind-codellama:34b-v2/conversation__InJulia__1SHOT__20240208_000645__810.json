If the bumped time would be greater than current time, it throws an error to prevent that. The second method definition is for the Date type where MethodError gets thrown if such an attempt is made.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 5, 27, 12) # Create a DateTime object\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 4) # Add 4 hours to the DateTime\nprintln(new_time)\n```\n\nNote: You need to replace `now()` with your specific date limit based on your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":7.855358324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
