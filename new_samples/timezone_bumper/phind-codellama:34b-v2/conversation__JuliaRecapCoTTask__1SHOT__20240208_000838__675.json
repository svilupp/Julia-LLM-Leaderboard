[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Function works only with DateTime types. Please provide a timestamp including date and time.\"))\n    else\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses the Dates module, which allows to perform operations on dates and times in Julia. The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: a DateTime object (`dt`) and an integer (`bump`). \nIf the first argument provided is of Date type instead of DateTime, the function will throw an error as requested. If it's a correct DateTime object, it will add the number of hours specified in `bump` to the given timestamp. The default value for `bump` if not specified is 3 hours.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ndt = now() # get current time\ndt_new = timezone_bumper(dt, 5) # increase time by 5 hours\nprintln(\"Original timestamp: $dt\")\nprintln(\"New timestamp after adding 5 hours: $dt_new\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.112154477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
