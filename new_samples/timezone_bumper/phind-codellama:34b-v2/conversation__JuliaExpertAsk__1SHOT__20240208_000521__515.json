If the `Date` type is passed to this function, it throws an error as mentioned in your requirement. \n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 8, 19, 13, 45) # create a DateTime object\ntimezone_bumper(dt)                # increase timestamp by default 3 hours => 2021-08-19T16:45:00\n\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 5)             # increase timestamp by 5 hours => 2021-08-19T18:45:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.071345754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
