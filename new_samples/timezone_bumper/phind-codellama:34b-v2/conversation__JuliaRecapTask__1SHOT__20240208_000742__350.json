[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way to write the `timezone_bumper` function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1) # This is a DateTime type\ntimezone_bumper(dt) # Should return \"2022-01-01T03:00:00\"\n\nd = Date(2022, 1, 1) # This is a Date type\ntimezone_bumper(d) # Should throw an error\n```\n\nThis code first loads the `Dates` module which provides functionality for working with dates and times in Julia. The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be of type `DateTime`, and `bump`, which is an integer representing the number of hours to add to the date time. If no second argument is provided, it defaults to 3 hours.\n\nThe function simply adds the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime` object using the `Hour` constructor, and returns the result. If the input is not of type `DateTime`, this operation will throw an error, as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":7.632307674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
