[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` list and only include the words that start with an uppercase letter. The resulting list is returned by the function.\n\n# Tests\n\nWe can test this function using the following code:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nexpected_output = [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\nactual_output = keep_only_names(words)\nassert actual_output == expected_output\n```\nThis code defines a list of words, defines the expected output for that list, and then calls the `keep_only_names` function with that list as input. Finally, it uses an `assert` statement to check that the actual output matches the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[206,213],"elapsed":5.312957172,"_type":"aimessage"}]
