In this case, we want to keep only elements that start with a capital letter, so we use the `startswith` function to check if an element starts with an uppercase letter.\n* The `uppercase` function is used to get the uppercase version of a string (i.e., all characters are converted to uppercase). We then take the first character of this uppercase string and compare it to the original string using the `===` operator. If they match, then the element starts with an uppercase letter and is kept in the output array.\n* The function returns the filtered array of words that start with capital letters.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n# filtered_words == [\"Hello\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,299],"elapsed":7.090080225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
