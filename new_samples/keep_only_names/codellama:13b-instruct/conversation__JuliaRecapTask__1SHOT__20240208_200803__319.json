[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> uppercasefirst(word) == word, words)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `filter` takes two arguments: a predicate function and an iterable object. It returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate. In this case, we want to filter out any words that don't start with a capital letter, so we pass in a lambda expression `(word -> uppercasefirst(word) == word)` as the predicate function.\n2. The `uppercasefirst` function takes a string and returns it with its first character converted to uppercase. This is used to compare each word to its uppercase version, which will be the same if the word starts with a capital letter.\n3. The returned collection is then passed as an argument to the `filter` function, which applies the predicate function to each element in the collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.\n\nNote: This solution uses the `uppercasefirst` function from the standard library, which was introduced in Julia 1.6. If you are using an earlier version of Julia, you may need to use a different approach to convert the first character of each word to uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[377,288],"elapsed":7.340534392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
