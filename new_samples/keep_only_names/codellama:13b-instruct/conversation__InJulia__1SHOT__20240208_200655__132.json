For each word, it checks whether the first letter is uppercase (using the `isuppercase` function). If the first letter is not uppercase, the word is not added to the result list. The final result is returned as an array.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all words in the input list are strings, and that they contain only one word per string. If your input list contains multiple words separated by spaces or other delimiters, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[77,200],"elapsed":4.788110746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
