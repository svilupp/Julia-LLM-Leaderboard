[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return words[begin:end] .|> w -> startswith(w, uppercase(w)) ? w : \"\" end\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `startswith(w, uppercase(w))` checks if the word `w` starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, then it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n2. The `.|>` operator is used to map the function on each element of the vector `words`.\n3. In the return statement, we are using a ternary operation to check if the current word starts with an uppercase letter or not. If it does, then we keep the word as it is, otherwise we replace it with an empty string `\"\"`.\n4. The function returns the filtered vector of words.\n\nNote: We could have also used `filter(w -> startswith(w, uppercase(w)), words)` instead of `.|>` to map and filter the vector at the same time.","status":200,"tokens":[377,240],"elapsed":6.186448275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
