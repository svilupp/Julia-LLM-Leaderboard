If the first character is not uppercase, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.\n* The resulting vector of booleans (representing which words start with a capital letter) is used as an index to extract the corresponding elements from the original `words` vector. This produces a new vector of strings containing only the words that started with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a list of words, like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result) # Output: [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,300],"elapsed":7.125128473,"_type":"aimessage"}]
