The `uppercase` function is used to ensure that we are checking against an uppercase version of the word, in case there are any lowercase letters.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input list of words is already in lowercase format. If your input list contains both lowercase and uppercase words, you may want to use a different approach to remove non-capitalized words.","status":200,"tokens":[115,176],"elapsed":4.293879203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
