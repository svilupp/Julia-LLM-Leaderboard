The `startswith` function is used to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter, and the `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase before checking for equality.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\n4-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"cat\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n```\nAs you can see, the function `keep_only_names` has removed all words that do not start with a capital letter, leaving only \"Dog\" and \"Cat\".","status":200,"tokens":[77,260],"elapsed":6.199556687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
