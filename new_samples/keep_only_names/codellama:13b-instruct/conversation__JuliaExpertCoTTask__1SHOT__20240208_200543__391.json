We use a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` list and create a new list with only the elements that start with an uppercase letter (i.e., `isupper(word[0])`).\n2. The `isupper()` function checks if the first character of a string is an uppercase letter.\n3. The resulting list is then returned.\n\nTest cases:\n```julia\n# Test case 1\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nexpected_result = [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\nassert keep_only_names(words) == expected_result\n\n# Test case 2\nwords = [\"Banana\", \"carrot\", \"dog\"]\nexpected_result = []\nassert keep_only_names(words) == expected_result\n```","status":200,"tokens":[206,235],"elapsed":5.806202832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
