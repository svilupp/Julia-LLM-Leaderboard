The `startswith` function is used to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. Finally, the result is returned as a new array containing only the words that were not removed.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\"]\n```\nThis will print an array containing only the words that start with a capital letter, in this case `[\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[77,233],"elapsed":5.571171458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
