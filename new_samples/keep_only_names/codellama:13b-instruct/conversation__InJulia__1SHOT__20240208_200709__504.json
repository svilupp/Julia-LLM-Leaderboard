It then checks each word to see if it starts with a capital letter using the `startswith` function and the `uppercase` function. If the word does start with a capital letter, it is added to the `names` list using the `push!` function. Finally, the `names` list is returned.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\", \"Fish\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,272],"elapsed":6.464766862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
