In this case, the function checks whether the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function. If it is, then the word is kept in the result list.\n* The `first` function is used to get the first character of a string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all words are lowercase letters followed by one or more uppercase letters (eg, \"dog\" but not \"Dog\"). If this is not the case, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[115,173],"elapsed":4.211933404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
