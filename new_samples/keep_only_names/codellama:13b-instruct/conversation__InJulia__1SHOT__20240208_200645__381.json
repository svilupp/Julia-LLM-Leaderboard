The `uppercase` function is used to convert each word to uppercase, so that we can compare it to the desired starting letter (\"D\").\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"Rabbit\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Kept names: $kept_names\")\n```\nThis would output the following:\n```\nKept names: [\"Mouse\", \"Rabbit\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,225],"elapsed":5.385705638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
