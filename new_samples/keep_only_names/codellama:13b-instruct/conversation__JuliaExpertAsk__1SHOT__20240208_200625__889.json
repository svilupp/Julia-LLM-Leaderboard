The resulting array of booleans is then used as an index into the original input array, selecting only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all words in the input array are valid Julia identifiers (i.e., they only contain letters, digits, and underscores). If you need to handle more general strings, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[115,192],"elapsed":4.656416957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
