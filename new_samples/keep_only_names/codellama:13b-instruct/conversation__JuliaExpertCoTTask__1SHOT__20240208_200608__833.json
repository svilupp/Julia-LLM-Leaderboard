Think through your approach step by step: We want to iterate over the list of words and remove all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need: We can define a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a list of words as an argument.\n3. Solve the task: We can use a loop to iterate over the list of words, check if each word starts with a capital letter using the `isupper` function, and append the word to a new list called `result` if it does.\n4. Check that your solution is correct: We can test our solution by calling the function with an example input, such as `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`, and checking that only the words that start with a capital letter are returned in the result list.\n\nNote that we didn't need any additional data to solve this task because the function already takes in a list of words as an argument, so we can test it directly. If the task had required us to use additional data, we would have created some examples and tested our solution on those examples.","status":200,"tokens":[206,341],"elapsed":8.301541441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
