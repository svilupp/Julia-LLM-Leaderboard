The `startswith` function is used to check if the word starts with an uppercase letter, and the `uppercase` function is used to convert the word to uppercase before checking.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the provided list of words is in lowercase. If the list contains both uppercase and lowercase words, you may need to modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[115,152],"elapsed":3.726765235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
