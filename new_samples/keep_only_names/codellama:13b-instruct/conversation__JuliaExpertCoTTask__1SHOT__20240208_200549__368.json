In this case, we're filtering out any words that do not start with an uppercase letter.\n* We use the `uppercase` function to convert the first character of each word to uppercase. If the first character is already uppercase, this has no effect.\n* The `==` operator is used to compare the first character of each word to the uppercase version of itself. This will return `true` if the first character is uppercase and `false` otherwise.\n* Finally, we wrap the whole expression in a call to `filter`, which returns only the words that satisfy the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[206,215],"elapsed":5.329541742,"_type":"aimessage"}]
