The `isuppercase` function checks whether the first character of a string is uppercase, and `first` function gets the first character of a string. If the first character of a word is uppercase, then the word starts with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\", \"fan\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":5.779085231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
