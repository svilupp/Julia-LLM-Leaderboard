It applies a function to each element in the passed collection (in this case, `words`), and returns a new collection containing only those elements for which the function returns `true`. \n\nThe function we pass into `filter`, `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`, checks if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. The `isuppercase` function from the Base module tests whether a character is an uppercase letter. It returns `true` if the character is uppercase and `false` otherwise. \n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":7.089252604,"_type":"aimessage"}]
