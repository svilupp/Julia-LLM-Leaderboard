If it does, the word is added to the `filtered_words` array. At the end of the function, `filtered_words` is returned, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter. \n\nPlease note that Julia's regular expression syntax is slightly different from some other languages: here `r\"^[A-Z]\"` means \"match any string that starts with an uppercase letter\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.189596943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
