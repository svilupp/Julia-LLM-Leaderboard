This is determined using the `isuppercase()` function, which checks whether a character is uppercase.\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the input vector, and if the first character of the current word is uppercase, it adds this word to the result vector (`result`). After going through all words, it returns the result vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":6.123656998,"_type":"aimessage"}]
