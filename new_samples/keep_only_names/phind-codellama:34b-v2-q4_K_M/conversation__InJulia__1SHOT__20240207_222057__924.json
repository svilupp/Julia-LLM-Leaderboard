For each word, it checks if the first letter is an uppercase letter using the `isuppercase()` function. If the first letter is not uppercase, the word is removed from the list using the `deleteat!()` function.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input in-place and returns the modified input. If you want to preserve the original input, you should make a copy of it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":6.565143982,"_type":"aimessage"}]
