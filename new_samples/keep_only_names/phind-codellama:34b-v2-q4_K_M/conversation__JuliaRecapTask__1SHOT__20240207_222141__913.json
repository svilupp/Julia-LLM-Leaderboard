[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function written in Julia that achieves your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input.\n- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the input vector. \n    - The `isuppercase(first(word))` check tests if the first character of the current word is uppercase. \n    - If this condition is true, the word is included in the output list; otherwise, it's discarded.\n- Finally, the function returns the output list, which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":5.147806812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
