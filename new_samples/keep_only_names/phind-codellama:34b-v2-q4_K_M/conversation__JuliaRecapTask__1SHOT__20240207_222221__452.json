[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using a list comprehension to filter out the words which don't start with a capital letter. Here is a function that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes as input a vector of abstract strings (`Vector{<:AbstractString}`) and returns a new vector that only contains the words where the first letter is uppercase. The `isuppercase` function checks whether a character is an uppercase letter, and `first(word)` gets the first character of the word. \n\nLet's test this function with some example data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\", \"fan\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```\n\nAs you can see, the function correctly filters out the words that don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":7.287094275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
