Here is how you could define `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Use list comprehension to only include words that start with a capital letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings `words` as input. It then iterates over each word in `words`, and if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase(word[1])`) it gets included in the new list. The list comprehension `[word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]` accomplishes this filtering. \n\nHere's how you could use `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Banana\"]\n```\n\nIn the example above, \"cat\" and \"apple\" are removed from `words` because they don't start with a capital letter. The result, `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Banana\"]`, is then printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":8.617121149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
