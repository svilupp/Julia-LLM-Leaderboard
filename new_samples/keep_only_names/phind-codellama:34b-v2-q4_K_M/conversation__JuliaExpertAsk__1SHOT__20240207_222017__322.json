It takes two arguments, a function and an iterable (like an array or list). The function should return `true` for elements we wish to keep and `false` for those we wish to discard.\n\nIn this case, our function checks if the word starts with a capital letter by using a regular expression (`ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)`). The caret (^) indicates the start of the line, and [A-Z] means any uppercase letter. If this pattern is found at the start of the string (`ismatch` checks for the first occurrence), the function returns `true`, signifying that we should keep this word.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Banana\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.035154785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
