Here's an example implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Iterate over the list of words and use filter to remove words that don't start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's Base library to iterate over each word in the provided list. The filtering condition checks whether the first character of the current word is an uppercase letter by using the `isuppercase` function. If this condition is met, the word is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":6.795803408,"_type":"aimessage"}]
