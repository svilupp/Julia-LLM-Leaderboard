[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that implements the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's base library to iterate over all elements in the input vector `words`. The filtering condition is a regular expression check that each word starts with a capital letter (`ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)`). This returns a new vector containing only the words that meet this condition.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\", \"donkey\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.07767445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
