It creates an empty list to store the names that start with a capital letter, then iterates over each word in the provided list. If the first character of the current word is uppercase (as determined by the `isupper()` function), it adds this word to the list of capitalized names. After iterating over all words, it returns the final list of capitalized names.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.404454842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
