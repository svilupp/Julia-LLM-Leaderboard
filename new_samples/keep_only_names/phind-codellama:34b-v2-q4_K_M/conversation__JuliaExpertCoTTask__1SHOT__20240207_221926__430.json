If it's not, you remove that word from the list. Here's how to do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    for i in length(words):-1:1\n        if !isuppercase(words[i][1])\n            deleteat!(words, i)\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThe `deleteat!` function is used to remove the element at a specified index from an array. Since we're iterating over the array in reverse order (to avoid issues with changing indices due to deletions), this function should work as expected. We use the `isuppercase` function to check whether the first character of each word is a capital letter.\n\nYou can then run your example like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\n[\"Carrot\", \"Apple\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":7.439577189,"_type":"aimessage"}]
