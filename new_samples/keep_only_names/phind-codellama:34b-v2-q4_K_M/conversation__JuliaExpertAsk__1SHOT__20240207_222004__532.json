It checks whether the first character of each word is uppercase by using the `isuppercase` function on the result of the `first` function (which gets the first character of a string). If this condition is true, the word is included in the output list; otherwise, it is excluded. \n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\", \"fan\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":5.802036975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
