[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem can be solved using a simple iteration over the given list of words. We will use Julia's built-in `filter!` function to modify the list in-place and keep only those words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere is how you would implement the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    filter!(word -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a regular expression to check if the first character of each word is a capital letter. The `filter!` function keeps only those words for which the provided function returns `true`. All other words are removed from the list.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\n\nAfter the function is executed, the `words` list will contain only those words that start with a capital letter: `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":7.360457062,"_type":"aimessage"}]
