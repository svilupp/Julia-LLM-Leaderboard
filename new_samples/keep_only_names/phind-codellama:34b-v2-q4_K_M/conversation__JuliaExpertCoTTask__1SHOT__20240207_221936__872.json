The `isuppercase` helper function is used to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. \n\nThe `filter` function is applied to the input list, which removes elements for which the provided function (`word -> isuppercase(first(word))`) returns `false`. In other words, it keeps only those words where the first character is an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":6.928412498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
