This function applies a filter to an array in place and removes elements for which the filter returns `false`. In this case, you want to keep only those words for which the first character is uppercase. Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter!(word -> isupper(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and filters it in place. The filtering condition is that the first character of each word (`first(word)`) must be uppercase (`isupper(first(word))`). If this condition is not met, the word gets removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":4.626059064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
