The `isuppercase` function checks whether the first character of a given string is uppercase, and the `first` function retrieves this first character. If this first character is uppercase, we include this word in our new list. Otherwise, we skip it. This results in a new list that contains only the words from the original list that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,149],"elapsed":4.051460573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
