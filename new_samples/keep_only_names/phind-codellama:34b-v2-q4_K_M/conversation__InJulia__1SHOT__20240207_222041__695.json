The `isuppercase()` function checks whether the first character of the current `word` is uppercase, and the `first()` function retrieves this first character. If the first character is uppercase, the `word` is included in the output list; otherwise, it's skipped. \n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function removes \"cat\", \"fish\", and \"apple\" from the `words` list because these words do not start with a capital letter. The resulting list contains only names that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.658747623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
