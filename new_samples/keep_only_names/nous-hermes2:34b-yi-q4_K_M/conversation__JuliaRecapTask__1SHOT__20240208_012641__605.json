[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will iterate through each word in the `words` list using a for loop and check if the first character of each word is uppercase or not. If it is, we keep the word; otherwise, we remove it from the list. We can use Julia's built-in `startswith()` function to check if a string starts with another string. Finally, we return the modified list.\n\nHere is the solution:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store words that start with capital letters\n    filtered_words = Array{String, 1}()\n\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(string(first(word)))) # Check if the first character is a capital letter\n            push!(filtered_words, word) # Add to filtered list if true\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the modified list\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nTo test this function, we can use the following code:\n```julia\nfunction test()\n    words = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Horse\", \"Cat\"]\n    print(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Horse\", \"Cat\"]\nend\ntest()\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":8.628723482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
