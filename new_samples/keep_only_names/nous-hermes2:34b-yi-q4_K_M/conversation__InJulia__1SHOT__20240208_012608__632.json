Here's how you can write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    for word in words\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z][a-z].*$\", word) # Check if the first letter of the word is capitalized\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings (`words`) as input and returns another vector containing only the names that start with a capital letter. The `ismatch` function checks if each word matches the regular expression pattern `r\"^[A-Z][a-z].*$\"`, which ensures that the first character is uppercase followed by at least one lowercase letter and any other characters after it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":6.051463869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
