Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes in a list of words as input.\n2. Iterate through each word in the given list.\n3. Check if the first letter of the word is capitalized.\n4. If it's not, skip adding this word to the new list.\n5. Continue with the next word until all words are checked.\n6. Return the final list containing only the capitalized names.\n\nHere's a Julia implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words\n        if occursin('A':'Z', first(word)) # check if the first letter is uppercase (capitalized)\n            push!(new_list, word) # add to new list if it passes the check\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\n\nTo test this function using the provided example:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThe output list contains only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[187,283],"elapsed":8.506651931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
