Define the function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of words as input.\n2. Create an empty list to store only the names that start with a capital letter.\n3. Iterate over each word in the provided list using a for loop.\n4. Check if the first character of the current word is a capital letter (using `isuppercase` function).\n5. If it starts with a capital letter, append the word to our new list.\n6. Finally, return the updated list containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    new_list = Vector{String}() # Create an empty list to store names starting with capital letters\n\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1]) # Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter\n            push!(new_list, word) # If so, append it to our new list\n        end\n    end\n\n    return new_list # Return the updated list containing only words starting with capital letters\nend\n```\n\n# Test Data\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":9.35577674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
