It then iterates over each `word` in the input list and checks whether the word starts with its first letter capitalized (using the `startswith()` function). If it does, that means the word was originally written with an uppercase first letter, so we keep it. Otherwise, we skip to the next word. The final vector contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":5.276380656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
