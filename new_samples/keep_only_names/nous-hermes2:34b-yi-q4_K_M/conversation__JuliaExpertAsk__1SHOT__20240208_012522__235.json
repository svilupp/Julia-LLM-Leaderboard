Then, we iterate over each element in the input `words` array and check if it starts with a capital letter using the `starts_with_capital` function. If so, we add this word to the `result` array.\n\nThe `is_capitalized` function checks if the first character of an input string is any of the English vowels (A, E, I, O, U) after converting it to uppercase using `uppercasefirst`. This ensures that words starting with a capital letter are considered regardless of whether they're proper nouns or not.\n\nThe `starts_with_capital` function checks if a word starts with a capital letter by calling the `is_capitalized` function on its first character and then ensuring all other characters in the word are lowercase using `all(islower, word[2:end])`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":11.635280002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
