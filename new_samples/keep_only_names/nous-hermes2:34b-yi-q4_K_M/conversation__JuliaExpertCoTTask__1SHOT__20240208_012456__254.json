Iterate over the list of words\n2. Check if each word starts with a capital letter\n3. Keep only those words that start with a capital letter\n4. Return a new list with the filtered words\n\nHere's an implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    lowercase_words = map(string, words) # Convert all strings to lowercase for comparison\n    filtered_words = filter((w::String) -> startswith(uppercasefirst(w), uppercasefirst(\"a\")), lowercase_words) # Filter only the words starting with a capital letter after converting to upper case and comparing with 'A'\n    return map(string, filtered_words) # Convert the strings back from their lowercase form before returning them\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test it with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThe output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Carrot\"]`, as only these words start with a capital letter after converting the strings to lowercase.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":8.146391298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
