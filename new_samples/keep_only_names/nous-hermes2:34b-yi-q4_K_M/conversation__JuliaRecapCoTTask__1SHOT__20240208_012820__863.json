[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets\n- `isuppercase(x)`: checks if the character is upper case\n- `filter(f::Function, collection)`: creates a new vector by applying function `f` to each element in `collection` and selecting the values for which `f` returns `true`.\n- `collect()`: collects items into an array. \n\n# Solution\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> isuppercase(x[1]), words)\nend\n```\n# Explanation\nThe provided function works by filtering the list of words `words` based on whether each word's first character is upper case. If a word starts with an uppercase letter (i.e., a capital letter) it will pass through the filter and remain in the final collection. All other words which donâ€™t start with an uppercase letter are removed from the output list.\n\nThis function does not require any special instructions to be followed as per user's request.\n\n# Double-checking\n```julia\nusing Test\n@test isempty(keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"])) == false\n@test isequal(collect(keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\"])), [\"Dog\"])\n```\nThe first test checks if the function returns a non-empty list for a list with at least one capitalized word. The second test ensures that all other lower case words are removed from the list of results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":10.043934922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
