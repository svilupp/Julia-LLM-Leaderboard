For example: `\"Ruby\".start_with?(\"Ru\")` returns true and `\"Ruby\".start_with?(\"Py\")` returns false.\n* Don't forget that strings are enumerables, so you can iterate over them with `#each`.\n* For more on iterating over an array, see this [lesson](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#forloops).\n\n## Source\n\n* https://gist.github.com/ryansobol/5252653#file-keep_only_names-rb","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":7.994330389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
