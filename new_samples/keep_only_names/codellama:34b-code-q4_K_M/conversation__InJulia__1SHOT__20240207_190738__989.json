That means that it modifies the original array instead of returning a copy of the array with modifications made to it. This can be important to know if we are trying to use an immutable object (such as `words`) and have it maintain its state after calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":4.771231174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
