[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this task using Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n\nfunction isuppercase(char::Char)\n    return 'A' <= char <= 'Z'\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of words and only keeps those words that start with an uppercase letter. The helper function `isuppercase` checks if a character is an uppercase letter by seeing if its ASCII value lies between 'A' and 'Z'. \n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input list contains only strings. If the list can contain non-string elements, you should add a check for this in the list comprehension.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":6.396665953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
