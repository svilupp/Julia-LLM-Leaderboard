The function `isuppercase` checks whether a given character is uppercase, and `first(word)` gets the first character of a string. Note that the function assumes that the input is a vector of strings; if this assumption does not hold, you may need to add some input validation.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Prints: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":5.706676946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
