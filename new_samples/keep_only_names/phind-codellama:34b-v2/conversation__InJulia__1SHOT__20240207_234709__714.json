The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. Finally, it returns the filtered list of words.\n\nIn the test section, we pass a vector of strings to the function and print the result. You should see that only words starting with a capital letter are printed as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":6.512316573,"_type":"aimessage"}]
