The `isuppercase()` function checks whether the first character of a given word is uppercase. If it is, this word gets included in the new vector. Otherwise, it gets filtered out.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords_vector = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Goat\", \"horse\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words_vector)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":5.423137833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
