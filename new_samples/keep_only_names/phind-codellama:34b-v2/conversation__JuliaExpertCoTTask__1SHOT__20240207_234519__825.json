[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this task by using list comprehension in Python. Here's the code for the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n```\n\nIn this function, we use list comprehension to iterate over each word in the provided list (`words`). For each word, we check if the first character of that word is a uppercase letter by using `word[0].isupper()`. If it is, we keep that word. Otherwise, we discard it. The result is a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided data:\n\n```python\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))  # Output: ['Apple', 'Carrot']\n```\n\nAs you can see, the output is a list containing only the words that start with a capital letter, which are \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\". The word \"banana\" is discarded because it doesn't start with a capital letter, and so is \"dog\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":6.652281502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
