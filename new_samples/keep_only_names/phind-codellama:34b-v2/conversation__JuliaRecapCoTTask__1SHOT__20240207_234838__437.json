[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    # Iterate over all words in the list\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if a character is uppercase\nisuppercase(c::Char) = c == uppercase(c)\n```\n\nThis function uses `filter!` from Julia's standard library to modify the input vector in-place. It keeps only those words where the first character is an uppercase letter. The helper function `isuppercase` checks if a given character is uppercase using the `uppercase` function. Note that this function assumes that the input `words` is a vector of strings; for other types of elements, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nIf you provide any special instructions, please make sure they are relevant to the Julia language and the task at hand.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":5.716513688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
