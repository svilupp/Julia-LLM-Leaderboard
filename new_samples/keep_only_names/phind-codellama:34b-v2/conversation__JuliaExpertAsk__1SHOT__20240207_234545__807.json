The `isuppercase` function checks whether its argument is an uppercase letter, and `first(word)` gets the first character of a word. Note that this solution assumes that words are non-empty strings, so you might want to add some error checking if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\", \"Fish\", \"goat\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Outputs: String[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Fish\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":5.694405696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
