[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # We use the filter function to only keep words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if first character of string is uppercase\nfunction isuppercase(c::Char)\n    return 'A' <= c <= 'Z'\nend\n\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Words that start with a capital letter: \", filtered_words)\n```\nThis program defines a function `keep_only_names` which takes in a list of words and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The helper function `isuppercase` checks if a character is uppercase. The main function uses the `filter` function to keep only those words for which the helper function returns `true`.\n\nThe example provided here includes a list of mixed case words, and the output will be a list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":6.727831304,"_type":"aimessage"}]
