[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, you're asked to write a function `keep_only_names` in the Julia programming language. The function should iterate over a list of words (`words`) and remove all the words that do not start with a capital letter. \n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# helper function to check if the first character of a string is uppercase\nfunction isuppercase(char::Char)\n    return char == uppercase(char)\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list and checks if the first letter of the word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is added to a new list (`filtered_words`). Once all words have been checked, the `filtered_words` list is returned.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\", \"Fish\", \"Ant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Fish\", \"Ant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":8.026316897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
