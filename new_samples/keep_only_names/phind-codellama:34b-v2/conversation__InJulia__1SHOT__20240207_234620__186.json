This function uses a list comprehension to filter out the words that don't start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n\nfunction isuppercase(c)\n    return 'A' <= c <= 'Z'\nend\n```\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fan\", \"Goat\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: String[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\"]\n```\n\nNote that the `isuppercase` function is not a built-in Julia function, so I've defined it to check if a character is an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[71,221],"elapsed":5.703239799,"_type":"aimessage"}]
