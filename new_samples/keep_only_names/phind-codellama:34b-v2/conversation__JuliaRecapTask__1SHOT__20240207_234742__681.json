[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use a simple loop to iterate over the list of words and the `startswith` function from Julia Base library to check if a word starts with a capital letter or not. If it doesn't start with a capital letter, we remove it from our list. \n\nHere is how you might implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n\nfunction isuppercase(c)\n    return 'A' <= c <= 'Z'\nend\n```\nIn the `keep_only_names` function, we use a list comprehension (a compact way of creating a new list by iterating over an existing one and applying a condition). The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of a word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it's removed.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input list contains only strings. If this is not guaranteed, additional error checking should be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":6.356484606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
