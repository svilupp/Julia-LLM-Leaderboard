[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\nFirst, let's import the required packages. For this task, we don't need any additional package. Julia has a built-in function `filter!` which will be useful to us for this task. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return words\nend\n\nfunction isuppercase(char::Char)\n    return 'A' <= char <= 'Z'\nend\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as its argument. Then, it filters the input words such that only those words remain which start with an uppercase letter. The `filter!` function modifies the input in-place, which is more efficient than creating a new array. \n\nThe `isuppercase` function checks if a character is an uppercase letter by comparing its ASCII value. \n\nNow you can test your function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fan\", \"Goat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output should be: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":7.336128385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
