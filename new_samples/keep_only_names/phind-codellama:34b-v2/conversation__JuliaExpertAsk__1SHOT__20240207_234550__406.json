The provided function checks if a word starts with a capital letter by using a regular expression (`r\"^[A-Z]\"`). If the word starts with a capital letter, `ismatch` returns true, and `filter` keeps the word. Otherwise, it removes the word.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\", \"Fish\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Fish\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":5.114769566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
