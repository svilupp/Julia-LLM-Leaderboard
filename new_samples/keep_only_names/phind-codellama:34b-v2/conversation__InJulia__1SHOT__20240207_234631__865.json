Here is how you might define the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if !isnothing(match(r\"^[A-Z]\", word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list (`words`). It keeps a word if it starts with a capital letter (i.e., if `match(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` is not `nothing`). The regex `\"^[A-Z]\"` matches any string that starts with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\", \"fan\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"cat\", \"apple\" and \"fan\" are removed from `words_list` because they don't start with a capital letter. The modified list contains only the words \"Dog\", \"Elephant\" and \"Ball\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":7.577158464,"_type":"aimessage"}]
