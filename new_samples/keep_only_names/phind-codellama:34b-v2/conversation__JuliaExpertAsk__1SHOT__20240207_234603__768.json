The `isuppercase()` function checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Goat\", \"antelope\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,178],"elapsed":4.483890469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
