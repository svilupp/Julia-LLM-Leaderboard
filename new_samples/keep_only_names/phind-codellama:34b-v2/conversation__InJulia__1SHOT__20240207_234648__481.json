In this case, the condition checks whether the first character of a word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nHere is how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\"]\nonly_names = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(only_names)  # Outputs: String[\"Dog\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":5.322188302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
