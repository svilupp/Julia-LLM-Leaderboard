The predicate for the filtering operation is a regular expression that checks if the first character of each word is a capital letter. Note that this implementation assumes that the input is a vector of strings and does not check for this condition, so providing an incorrect input may lead to undesired behavior. If you want to add a check for the input, you can do:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    if !all(x -> typeof(x) == String, words)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"All elements in input vector should be of type String\"))\n    end\n    filter!(word -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\nend\n```\n\nNow, the function throws an error if all elements in the input vector are not of type `String`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":6.500369012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
