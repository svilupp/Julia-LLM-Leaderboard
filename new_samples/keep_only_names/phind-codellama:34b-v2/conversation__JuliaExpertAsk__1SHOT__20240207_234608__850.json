The `isuppercase` function checks whether the first character of a given word is uppercase, and the `first` function retrieves the first character of the string.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":5.080080386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
