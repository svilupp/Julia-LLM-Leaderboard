We will use a built-in method called `isuppercasefirst` which checks if the first character of a string is uppercase or not:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercasefirst(word)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list, and keeps only those that start with an uppercase letter. The `isuppercasefirst` method checks whether the first character of a string is an uppercase letter or not. If it is, then the word is added to the final list using list comprehension syntax. \n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Outputs: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":6.001173916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
