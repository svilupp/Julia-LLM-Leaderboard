This function uses a list comprehension to filter out words that start with a lowercase letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String, 1})\n    [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))]\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `startswith` and `uppercase` functions to check if a word starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, the word is included in the output list; otherwise, it's ignored. The `first` function gets the first character of the word, and `uppercase` converts this to uppercase. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # Returns [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":5.671463093,"_type":"aimessage"}]
