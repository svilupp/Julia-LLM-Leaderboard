[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write your function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if !islowercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input. It then iterates over each string, checking the first character to see if it is not lowercase (`islowercase`). If the first character is uppercase, the word is included in the returned list (via `first(word)`). \n\nTesting this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # Returns [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\n\nThis seems to be working as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":5.504270337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
