The boolean function checks if the first letter of each word (accessed by index 1) is equal to its uppercase version. It also handles the case where the word could be empty.\n\nYou can test this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"dog\", \"Dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # prints out [\"Dog\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,192],"elapsed":5.405167864,"_type":"aimessage"}]
