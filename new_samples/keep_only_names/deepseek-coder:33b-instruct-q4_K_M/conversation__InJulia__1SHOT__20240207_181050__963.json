This function uses the `filter` function from Julia's Base library to filter out the words that don't start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String, 1})\n    return filter(x -> !islowercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- `filter` is used to iterate over the provided list of words.\n- It uses a lambda function (an anonymous function in Julia) as its first argument which checks if the first character of each word is not lowercase. \n- The `first(x)` function gets the first character of the current word, and `islowercase(first(x))` returns true if it's a lower case letter.\n- The \"!\" operator negates this result so that `filter` only includes words where the first character is not lowercase. \n\nPlease note, this function expects an array of strings as input and will return an array of strings. If you want to keep the original datatype (e.g., a tuple), it's more complicated since tuples are immutable in Julia. You might need to convert your input into an array or use another data structure that allows modifications, like a `Vector` from Julia's Standard Library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":8.525418786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
