The function `keep_only_names` will filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) # It should return [\"Apple\"]\n```\n\nThe `filter` function in Julia takes two arguments: a function that returns true if we want to keep an element and an iterable (like an array) over which we want to apply this filter. Here, the lambda function `word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1])` checks whether the first character of each word is in upper case or not. If it is, that means the word starts with a capital letter and hence, the word is kept, else it is filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":6.323354687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
