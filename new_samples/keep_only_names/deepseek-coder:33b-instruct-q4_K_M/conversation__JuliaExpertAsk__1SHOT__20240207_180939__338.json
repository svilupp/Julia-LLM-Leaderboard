We can use the `isuppercasefirst` function from the `Base` module which checks whether the first character of a string is an uppercase letter. \n\nHere is a simple way to implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercasefirst(word), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library, which creates a new list by filtering out certain elements based on some condition. In this case, it keeps only those elements (words) for which `isuppercasefirst(word)` is true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,151],"elapsed":4.254737305,"_type":"aimessage"}]
