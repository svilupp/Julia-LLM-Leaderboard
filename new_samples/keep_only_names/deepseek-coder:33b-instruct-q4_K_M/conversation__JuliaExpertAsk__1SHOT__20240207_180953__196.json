Then it iterates over each word in the provided list of words (`words`). If the first letter of a word is not lowercase, it means that the word starts with a capital letter and pushes it into the array. The result is an array containing only words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":4.458542347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
