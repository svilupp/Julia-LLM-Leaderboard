In Julia, we typically use a comprehension to filter arrays which is more efficient than using traditional loops.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word))) && word == titlecase(word)]\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each word in the provided list and keeps only those that are capitalized. The `startswith` function is used to check whether a word starts with an uppercase letter. The `uppercase(first(word))` part makes sure we compare the first letter of the word against its uppercase version, because Julia's `startswith` function is case sensitive. Also `titlecase(word)` ensures that only words with title-cased format are kept (for example \"Dog\" but not \"DOG\").\n\nYou can call this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Mouse\", \"BIRD\", \"Fish\", \"bat\", \"Hippo\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # output is [\"Cat\", \"Mouse\", \"Fish\", \"Hippo\"]\n```\nThis example will keep words that start with a capital letter and are in title case. It does not consider words like \"BIRD\" or \"DOG\". If you want to include them, remove the condition `word == titlecase(word)` from function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":9.522384007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
