The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase, and we use it to check the first character of each word. If the first character is an uppercase letter, then the entire word gets added to the result list using `push_bang`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":5.633928745,"_type":"aimessage"}]
