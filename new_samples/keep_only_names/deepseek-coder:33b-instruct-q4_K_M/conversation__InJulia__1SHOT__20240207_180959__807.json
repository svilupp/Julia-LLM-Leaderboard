Here is how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word, 'A':'Z'), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of words as input (`words`). It then applies the `filter()` function to this list. The anonymous function passed into `filter()` checks each word and returns true if the first letter of the word is uppercase, otherwise false. Only those words for which the function returns true are kept in the resulting list. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes all letters will be from the English alphabet and doesn't handle non-English alphabets or special symbols like accented letters. If you need to handle such cases, you might want to modify it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[69,195],"elapsed":5.631842797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
