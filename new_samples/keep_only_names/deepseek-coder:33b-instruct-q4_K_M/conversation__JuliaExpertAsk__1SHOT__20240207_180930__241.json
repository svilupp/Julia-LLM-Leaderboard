This function uses the `filter` and `isuppercasefirst` functions available in Julia Base library to accomplish this task. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of strings as input and returns another array that only includes the strings which start with a capital letter. The `filter` function works by applying the given function to each element in the list, and only keeping elements for which the function returns true. In this case, the function checks if the first character of the string is uppercase using the `isuppercase(word[1])` expression.","status":200,"tokens":[0,189],"elapsed":5.332050609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
