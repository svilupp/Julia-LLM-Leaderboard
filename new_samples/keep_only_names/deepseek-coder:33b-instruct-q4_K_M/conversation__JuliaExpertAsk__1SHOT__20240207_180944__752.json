We will use regular expressions to match words starting with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    names = filter(word -> !ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word), words)\n    return names\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a vector of strings `words`, iterates over each word and keeps only those starting with a capital letter. It uses the regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` to check if a string starts with an uppercase character. The `filter` function is used here because it returns only the elements for which the condition (`ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", word) == false`) holds true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":4.995504657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
