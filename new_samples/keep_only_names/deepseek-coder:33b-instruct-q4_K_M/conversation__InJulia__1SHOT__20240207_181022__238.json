Here's how you could write your function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function in Julia, which takes a vector of elements and returns a new vector that only contains the elements for which the provided function (in this case, `isuppercase(first(word))`) returns true. The `filter` function is very powerful in Julia as it can be used with any condition you might want to use.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":4.445989938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
