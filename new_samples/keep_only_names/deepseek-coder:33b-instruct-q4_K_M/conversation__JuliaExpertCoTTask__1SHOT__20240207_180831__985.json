It uses the `filter` function from base module of Julia which takes a predicate (a boolean-valued function) and an iterable as input and returns a new iterable containing only those elements that satisfy the given predicate. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nIn this function, `filter` checks each string in the provided vector of strings to see if its first character (index 1) is an uppercase letter. If it is, then that word passes the test and gets included in the result. The `keep_only_names` function returns a new Vector which only includes those words that pass this test.\n\nTest the function with your provided data:\n```julia\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])) # should return [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.440679385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
