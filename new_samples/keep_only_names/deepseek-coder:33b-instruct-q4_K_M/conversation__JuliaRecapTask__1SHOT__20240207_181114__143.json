[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is how you can solve this problem in Julia. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    return filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function which takes a list and a predicate, returning only elements of the list for which the predicate returns true. The predicate here checks if the first letter of each word is in upper case. \n\nTesting:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # returns: String[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nThe output is the list of words that start with a capital letter. The `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to upper case before comparison, ensuring correctness regardless of case sensitivity. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other problem statement and I will be happy to help solve it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":7.038650925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
