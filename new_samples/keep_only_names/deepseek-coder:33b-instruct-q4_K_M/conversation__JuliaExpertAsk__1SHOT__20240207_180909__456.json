The result is a new list containing only the capitalized words from the original list.\n\nPlease note that this function considers punctuation as non-alphabetical characters, so \"Dog.\" will not be included in the returned list. If you want to include such words (for example, because they contain only one uppercase letter and are considered names), you can modify the function like this:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n```\n\nThis version considers all words that start with an uppercase letter to be valid names, regardless of whether they contain any other characters.","status":200,"tokens":[100,257],"elapsed":7.406910654,"_type":"aimessage"}]
