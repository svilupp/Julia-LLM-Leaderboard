This function uses the `filter` function to filter out those words which satisfy the condition of starting with an upper case character. The `isuppercasefirst` function checks if the first character in the string is an upper case letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercasefirst(word), words)\nend\n\nfunction isuppercasefirst(s::AbstractString)\n    if isempty(s)\n        return false\n    end\n    first_char = s[1]\n    return (first_char >= 'A' && first_char <= 'Z')\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `keep_only_names` takes a vector of strings as an input and returns another vector of string where only those words start with an upper case letter. The `isuppercasefirst` function checks if the first character in the provided string is an upper case letter or not. If it is then it returns true otherwise false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":6.584657474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
