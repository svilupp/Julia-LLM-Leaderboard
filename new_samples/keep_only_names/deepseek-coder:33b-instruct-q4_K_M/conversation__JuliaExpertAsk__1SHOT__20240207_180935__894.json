This condition can be expressed as an anonymous function or lambda function that returns `true` for elements you want to keep and `false` otherwise. \n\nHere's how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn the function above, `filter` checks each word in the list. If the first character of a word (`word[1]`) is an upper case letter according to the `isuppercase` function, then the word will be kept; if it's not, the word will be removed. The filtered words are returned as a new list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,187],"elapsed":5.275274119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
