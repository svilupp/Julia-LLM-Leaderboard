[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by splitting the markdown string into different sections using Python's split function with \"\\n\\n\" as the delimiter. Then filter out the sections that start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". Here is a sample code snippet to do that in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # split into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"\\n\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(section[11:end], r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")  # remove leading spaces and newlines\n        elseif startswith(section, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(section[9:end], r\"^\\s+\" => \"\")  # remove leading spaces and newlines\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, I'm assuming that the question and answer sections are separated by two newline characters (\"\\n\"). The `replace` function is used to strip off any leading whitespace or newlines.\n\nThis function will return a tuple of strings where the first string is the question and the second string is the corresponding answer. If no question or answer section is found in the markdown, an empty string will be returned for that part.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":9.165162251,"_type":"aimessage"}]
