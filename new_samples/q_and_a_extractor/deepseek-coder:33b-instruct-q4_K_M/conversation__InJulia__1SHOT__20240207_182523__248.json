[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    m = match(r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)(?:#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)$|$)\", md, s)\n    if m !== nothing\n        question = strip(m.captures[1])\n        answer = m.captures[2] === nothing ? \"\" : strip(m.captures[2])\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        error(\"Could not find Question and Answer in the text\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using a regular expression to match all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. If there is no `Answer` section, it will still return an empty string for the answer. The leading spaces are stripped from both question and answer. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each markdown document only contains a single pair of \"Question\" and \"Answer\". If there can be multiple pairs in one document, you need to modify it accordingly. Also, this solution does not handle nested formatting (e.g., `# Question ## Subquestion`) or other edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":7.888294746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
