Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Python's built-in regular expression module `re` to solve this problem. Here is an example function that does what you asked for:\n\n```python\nimport re\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(\"# Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*#\", md, flags=re.DOTALL).group(1)\n    answer = re.search(\"# Answer\\n*(.*?)\\Z\", md, flags=re.DOTALL).group(1)\n    return question.strip(), answer.strip()\n```\n\nThis function works by searching the input string `md` for the sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\". The regular expression pattern `# Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*#` matches a \"# Question\", followed by any number of characters until it reaches another \"# Answer\". This is done in a non-greedy way, meaning that it will stop at the first match. The same goes for finding the \"Answer\" section with `# Answer\\n*(.*?)\\Z` where \\Z matches the end of the string and * means any number of occurrences of the preceding element (except in this case since there is no following element).\n\nAfter extracting the question and answer sections, the leading spaces are removed using the `strip()` method. Finally, it returns them as a tuple. \n\nNote that if the format does not match what you specified or there is any error in the text, this function may fail. If you want to handle these situations gracefully, you would need additional code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":9.866659334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
