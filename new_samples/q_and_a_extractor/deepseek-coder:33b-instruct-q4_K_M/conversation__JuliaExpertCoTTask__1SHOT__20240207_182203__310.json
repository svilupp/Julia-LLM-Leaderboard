Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a python function `q_and_a_extractor` to solve this task. It splits the text by \"#\" character and then checks each section whether it starts with \" Question\" or \" Answer\". If yes, it strips leading spaces, newlines and saves the text in question/answer variable.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    sections = md.split(\"#\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections:\n        stripped_section = section.strip()\n        \n        if stripped_section.startswith(\"Question\"):\n            question += stripped_section[8:]\n            \n        elif stripped_section.startswith(\"Answer\"):\n            answer += stripped_section[6:]\n    \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function works as follows:\n\n- It splits the markdown text by \"#\", which separates each section.\n- Then for every section, it strips leading and trailing spaces.\n- If the section starts with \"Question \", it adds the rest of the string (after \"Question \") to the question variable.\n- If the section starts with \"Answer \", it adds the rest of the string (after \"Answer \") to the answer variable.\n- It finally returns a tuple of the collected question and answer.\n\nLet's test it on your example:\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```\nExpected output is `('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')`. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" will be in the start of a line (after stripping spaces) for it to recognize as a question or answer, and also assumes each section will not contain multiple questions/answers. If your markdown text is different, you may need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[238,457],"elapsed":13.326896978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
