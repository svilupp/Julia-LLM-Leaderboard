[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one way to solve this task using Julia's regex and string manipulation capabilities:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = map(m -> strip(m.captures[1]), eachmatch(r\"# Question\\n+([^#]*)\", md))\n    answers = map(m -> strip(m.captures[1]), eachmatch(r\"# Answer\\n+([^#]*)\", md))\n\n    return collect(zip(questions, answers))\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` works by searching for the pattern \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" in the given markdown string. It captures all text that follows these headers until the next header using a regular expression (regex). The captured texts are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\nThe function finally returns a tuple of `(question, answer)` pairs for each question-answer pair found in the markdown text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one \"# Question\" header followed by its corresponding answer (i.e., no nested questions). If your markdown document has nested questions and answers you might need to adjust this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":7.957994136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
