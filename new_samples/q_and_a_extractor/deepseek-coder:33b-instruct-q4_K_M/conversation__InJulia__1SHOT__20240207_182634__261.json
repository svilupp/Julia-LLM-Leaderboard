[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define your function `q_and_a_extractor` to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            question = strip(replace(line, \"# Question\" => \"\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            answer = strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\"))\n        elseif !in_question && !in_answer\n            continue\n        elseif in_question && line == \"\"\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && line == \"\"\n            in_answer = false\n            return (question, answer)\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a string `md` as input. It splits the markdown text into lines, then for each line it checks if it starts with \"# Question\", in which case it sets a flag and extracts the question by removing the \"# Question\" part of the line. If the line is \"# Answer\", it sets another flag and does the same for the answer. \n\nIf neither flag is set, it just continues to the next line. If the flag for question or answer is set and a blank line is found, it resets that flag since we've reached the end of the respective section. \n\nFor lines which are part of either Question or Answer sections, it appends them after stripping off any leading/trailing spaces to their respective strings until an empty line is encountered (indicating the end of current question-answer pair). \n\nThe function returns a tuple `(question, answer)` when it finds an empty line following an Answer. Please note that this function assumes that the Question and Answer sections are separated by blank lines. If there are more complex cases with nested questions/answers or multiple answers to one question you might need to adjust the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,536],"elapsed":15.254639013,"_type":"aimessage"}]
