Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function that can solve this task using regular expressions to match question and answer sections:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # find all text between '# Question' and '# Answer'\n    questions = re.findall(r\"#\\sQuestion((?:\\n|.)*?)#\\sAnswer\", md)\n    answers = re.findall(r\"#\\sAnswer((?:\\n|.)*)\", md)\n    \n    # remove leading newline and space characters for each question and answer\n    questions = [q.strip() for q in questions]\n    answers = [a.strip() for a in answers]\n        \n    return list(zip(questions, answers))[0]  # return as tuple\n```\n\nThe function works by using regular expressions to find all text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers. The `re.findall` method returns a list of all matches. We then use Python's built-in `strip` function to remove leading newline and space characters from each question and answer. \n\nFinally, we return the first match as a tuple using the `zip` function. If there are multiple questions/answers in the text, you can modify this function to return all of them as a list of tuples by removing [0] at the end of the last line.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":8.98025989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
