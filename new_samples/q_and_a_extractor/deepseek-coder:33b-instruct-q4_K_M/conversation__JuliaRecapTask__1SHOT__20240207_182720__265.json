[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The function finds the indices of lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", then extracts the corresponding blocks of text, strips leading spaces and newlines from them and returns as tuples in an array.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split the markdown into lines\n    \n    questions = findall(x -> startswith(strip(x), \"# Question\"), lines)  # Find indices of question lines\n    answers = findall(x -> startswith(strip(x), \"# Answer\"), lines)  # Find indices of answer lines\n    \n    q_and_a = []\n    \n    for i in 1:length(questions)\n        if i < length(answers) && answers[i] < questions[i+1]  # If there's an answer after the question and before the next question\n            push_q_and_a(lines, q_and_a, questions[i], answers[i])\n        elseif i == length(answers) && questions[i] < answers[i] # If this is the last question with an answer after it\n            push_q_and_a(lines, q_and_a, questions[i], answers[i])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return q_and_a\nend\n\nfunction push_q_and_a(lines, q_and_a, question_index, answer_index)\n    question = strip(join(lines[question_index+1:answer_index-1], \" \"))  # Join lines between the Question and Answer section, then strip leading/trailing spaces\n    answer = strip(join(lines[(answer_index+1):end], \" \"))  # Join all remaining lines for the Answer section, then strip leading/trailing spaces\n    \n    push_q_and_a_helper(q_and_a, question, answer)\nend\n\nfunction push_q_and_a_helper(q_and_a, question, answer)\n    if !isempty(question) && !isempty(answer)  # Only add to the array if both Question and Answer are not empty after stripping\n        push_to_array_helper(q_and_a, (question, answer))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction push_to_array_helper(arr, tuple)\n    pushfirst(arr, tuple)  # Push the tuple to the array\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work well if your markdown is correctly formatted with one \"# Question\" section followed by its corresponding \"# Answer\" section. If there are multiple questions or answers in one section, it might not behave as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[433,637],"elapsed":18.841647351,"_type":"aimessage"}]
