[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's built-in string processing capabilities to accomplish this task. Here is an example of how you might write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= \"$(strip(replace(line, \"# Question\"=>\"\")))\\n\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= \"$(strip(replace(line, \"# Answer\" => \"\")))\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input `md` into lines and iterating over each line. When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it appends the rest of the line to `question` after removing the leading `# Question` and any surrounding whitespace. Similarly, when it encounters a line that starts with `# Answer`, it appends the rest of the line to `answer` after removing the leading `# Answer` and any surrounding whitespace. At the end, it returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":8.307513363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
