When it encounters `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets a flag to indicate that the following lines are part of either the question or the answer section. If a line is not part of any section (i.e., it is neither a question nor an answer), it ignores it. It then concatenates all lines in each section and returns them as tuples. The strip() methods are used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":9.037282416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
