[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation for your problem in Julia. This function works by splitting the markdown text by the headers `# Question` and `# Answer` and then stripping leading spaces and newlines from the extracted parts.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the string into sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    splits = split(md, r\"(?=#\\sQuestion|#\\sAnswer)\", keepempty=true)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty vector to store questions and answers\n    qa_pairs = []\n\n    for i in 1:2:length(splits)-1\n        # Get the question and answer sections\n        question, answer = splits[i], splits[i+1]\n        \n        # Strip leading spaces and newlines from each section\n        question_stripped = strip(question)\n        answer_stripped = strip(answer)\n        \n        # Add the question and answer to the list of pairs\n        pushfirst(qa_pairs, (question_stripped[10:end], answer_stripped[8:end])) \n    end\n    \n    return qa_pairs\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your markdown text to it. The returned value will be a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. \n\nFor instance:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nParis\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will return `[(\"What is the capital of France\", \"Paris\")]`.","status":200,"tokens":[10,396],"elapsed":11.555149834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
