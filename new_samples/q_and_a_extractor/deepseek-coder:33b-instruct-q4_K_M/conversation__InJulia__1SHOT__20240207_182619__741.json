We are assuming that markdown sections start with `# Question` or `# Answer` and ends at the next occurrence of these words or end of string (`$`).\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # split the string into an array of lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # initialize variables to hold question and answer text\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # flag to indicate we are in a question or answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # check if we've reached the end of a question/answer section\n        if in_question && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n        \n        # check if we're entering a question or answer section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # append the line to the appropriate variable\n        if in_question\n            question *= \" $line\" \n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= \" $line\" \n        end\n    end\n    \n    # strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer 1\nMy name is Julia.\n\n# Question 2\nHow old are you?\n\n# Answer 2\nI am an artificial intelligence and don't have an age.\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer:   \", a)\n```\nThis will print:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestion: What is your name?
