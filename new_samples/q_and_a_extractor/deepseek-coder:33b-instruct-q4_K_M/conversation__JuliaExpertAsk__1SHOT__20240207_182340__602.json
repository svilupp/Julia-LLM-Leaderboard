Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that accomplishes this task using regular expressions to extract sections of text. It uses the re module for regular expression operations. The findall method returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    questions = re.findall('# Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*# Answer', md, re.DOTALL)\n    answers = re.findall('# Answer\\n*(.*?)(?:$|# )', md, re.DOTALL)\n    result = [(q.strip(), a.strip()) for q, a in zip(questions, answers)]\n    return result[0] if len(result) == 1 else result\n```\nIn the regular expression pattern `'# Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*# Answer'`, `'\\n*'` matches any number of newlines (including zero), and `'.*?'` is a non-greedy match that will return as few characters as possible. This means it will stop at the first instance of `# Answer` after each Question section.\nSimilarly for answers pattern `'(.*?)(?:$|# )'`, this matches any text until it hits the end of line or a new heading (starting with `#`). The `(?:$|# )` is a non-capturing group that matches either the end of line (`$`) or a new heading.\nThe strip function removes leading and trailing whitespace from strings in Python. This is necessary to get rid of any extra spaces at the beginning or end of each question or answer section. \nFinally, if only one match is found then it returns only one tuple otherwise return list of tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":11.276721471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
