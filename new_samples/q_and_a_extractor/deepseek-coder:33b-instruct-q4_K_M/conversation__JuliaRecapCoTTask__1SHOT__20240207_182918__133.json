[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `split` function with the `# Question` and `# Answer` as separators to extract all questions and answers in the markdown text respectively, then strip leading spaces and newlines from each extracted section. The `strip` function can be used for this purpose. Here is a possible Julia code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text by separators \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n    sections = split(md, r\"# (Question|Answer):?\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the question and answer.\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over the sections.\n    for section in sections[2:end]\n        # If the section starts with \"Question\", it's a question.\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(section)\n        # Otherwise, it's an answer.\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(section)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple.\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will work for most cases but may not handle some edge cases properly. For example, if there is an `# Answer` before a corresponding `# Question`, it might confuse the code and assign an answer to the wrong question. It also assumes that all sections are correctly formatted with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and does not handle scenarios where questions or answers do not have corresponding sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":10.458632018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
