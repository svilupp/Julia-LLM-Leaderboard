[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's built-in regular expressions functionality to find and extract sections of markdown formatted text. The function `split_markdown` splits the given markdown text into sections based on '# Question' or '# Answer'. Then, it goes through each section and checks if it contains 'Question' or 'Answer', and then appends the content to either a question or an answer string accordingly. Finally, it returns the tuple `(question, answer)` after stripping leading spaces and newlines from both strings.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    sections = split(md, r\"^# Question|Answer$\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", section)\n            question *= strip(section[length(\"# Question\")+1:end])  # skip '# Question'\n        elseif occursin(\"Answer\", section)\n            answer *= strip(section[1:end-length(\"Answer\")])  # skip 'Answer'\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe function uses the `occursin` function to check if a string contains another string. It also uses the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing spaces from strings, as well as newlines using regex replacement.\n\nThis solution assumes that there is only one '# Question' section and one 'Answer' section in the markdown text, and that they appear in this order (i.e., a question comes before an answer). If your input can have multiple questions or answers, or if they don't come in this specific order, you will need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":11.301661507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
