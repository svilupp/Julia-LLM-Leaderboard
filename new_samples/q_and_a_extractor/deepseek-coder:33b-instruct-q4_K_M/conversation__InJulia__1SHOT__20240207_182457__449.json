It uses regular expressions to find all sections starting with `# Question` or `# Answer` and then extracts the relevant text. The resulting question-answer pairs are collected into a vector and returned by the function. \n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown string into sections starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n    sections = split(md, r\"# (?:Question|Answer).*\")[2:end]\n    \n    # Create an empty vector to store question-answer pairs.\n    q_and_a_pairs = Vector{Tuple{String, String}}()\n    \n    for i in 1:2:length(sections)\n        # Extract the text from each pair of sections.\n        question = strip(replace(sections[i], r\"^#.*?\\n\" => \"\"))\n        answer = strip(replace(sections[i+1], r\"^#.*?\\n\" => \"\"))\n        \n        # Add the extracted pair to the vector.\n        push_!!q_and_a_pairs, (question, answer))\n    end\n    \n    return q_and_a_pairs\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that every question and answer will be in its own section and they will appear in pairs consecutively. If this is not the case, you might need to adjust the function accordingly. Also note that this function does not handle nested sections or other types of markdown formatting beyond headers and paragraphs.","status":200,"tokens":[106,359],"elapsed":10.311776961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
