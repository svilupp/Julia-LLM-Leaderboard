[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions to parse the markdown text and extract questions and answers. This approach works by splitting the input string into lines, then iterating through each line looking for those starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". It also strips leading spaces and newlines from extracted text.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    question, answer = '', ''\n    in_question, in_answer = False, False\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if not (in_question or in_answer) and re.match('# Question',line):  # start of a question block\n            in_question = True\n            continue\n        elif not (in_question or in_answer) and re.match('# Answer',line):  # start of an answer block\n            in_answer = True\n            continue\n        \n        if in_question:\n            question += line + '\\n'\n        elif in_answer:\n            answer += line + '\\n'\n            \n        if re.match('# Question|# Answer',line):  # end of a block\n            if in_question:\n                in_question = False\n                continue\n            elif in_answer:\n                in_answer = False\n    \n    return question.strip(), answer.strip()\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there is exactly one \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" block in the markdown text. If there are more, it will only extract the last one for each. It also does not handle nested blocks (i.e., a question or answer inside another question or answer). \n\nIf you have multiple questions/answers, you'll need to modify the solution to return a list of tuples instead. You can do this by replacing `question = ''` and `answer = ''` with `questions_and_answers = []` and appending `(question.strip(), answer.strip())` inside each if-block where you detect a question or an answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":13.300930147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
