Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Python, you can use regular expressions to extract the parts of the markdown text that start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(\"# Question\\n*([\\w\\W]*?)# Answer\", md).group(1)\n    answer = re.search(\"# Answer\\n*([\\w\\W]*?)$\", md).group(1)\n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n```\nIn this code:\n\n- `re.search` is used to find the first match of a regular expression in a string. The regular expressions \"# Question\\n*([\\w\\W]*?)# Answer\" and \"# Answer\\n*([\\w\\W]*?)$\" are looking for sections starting with \"# Question\", ending with \"# Answer\" and starting with \"# Answer\" until the end of the string, respectively.\n- The `group(1)` method returns the part of the match that is in parentheses in the regular expression (in this case, it's \"[\\w\\W]*?\"), which matches any word character or non-word character (any character).\n- `strip()` removes leading and trailing spaces from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is exactly one section of each type in the markdown string. If there are multiple sections, you may need to adjust the code to extract all matches instead of just the first match. Also, please be aware that regular expressions can be a bit complex and this one is a simplified example. Depending on how much your markdown text deviates from the assumptions made in this solution, you might need to adjust it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":11.186118767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
