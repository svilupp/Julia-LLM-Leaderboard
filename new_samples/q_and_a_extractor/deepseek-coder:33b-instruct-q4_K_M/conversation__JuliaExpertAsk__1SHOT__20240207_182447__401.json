Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Python's built-in string methods to extract the required information. Here is one way you could do it using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    question, answer = '', ''\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question += ' ' + line[len('# Question'):].strip()\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer += ' ' + line[len('# Answer'):].strip()\n            \n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n```\nIn this function, we split the input string `md` by newline characters to get a list of lines in the markdown text. Then, for each line, if it starts with `'# Question'` or `'# Answer'`, we add the rest of the line (excluding the '# Question'/'# Answer') to the corresponding string variable (question/answer). Finally, we return a tuple containing the stripped question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":7.162450953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
