[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution that uses regular expressions for the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown into sections based on \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers\n    split_md = split(md, r\"(?=# Question)\", limit=2)\n    \n    # If there's no \"# Answer\", return nothing for the answer\n    if length(split_md) == 1 || !occursin(\"# Answer\", md)\n        question = strip(replace(split_md[1], r\"# Question\\n\" => \"\"))\n        return (question, \"\")  # No answer provided\n        \n    elseif length(split_md) > 1 && occursin(\"# Answer\", md)\n        question = strip(replace(split_md[1], r\"# Question\\n\" => \"\"))\n        answer = strip(replace(split_md[2], r\"# Answer\\n\" => \"\"))\n        \n    else\n        return (\"\", \"\")  # No question or answer provided\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution works by splitting the markdown text into two parts at each `# Question`. The first part is the question and the second part after the next `# Answer` is the answer. If there's no `# Answer`, it returns an empty string for the answer. This function also strips any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":9.729672651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
