[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to extract sections of text based on patterns. Here is an example function that might do what you want:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = split(md, r\"^# Question\")[2:end]\n    answers = split(md, r\"^# Answer\")[2:end]\n\n    result = []\n\n    for (question, answer) in zip(questions, answers)\n        q_start, q_end = findfirst(\"```\", question), findlast(\"# Answer\", question)\n        a_start, a_end = findfirst(\"\\n\", answer), findlast(\"# Question\", answer)\n\n        q_text = strip(question[q_start+4:q_end-1])\n        a_text = strip(answer[a_start+1:a_end-2])\n        \n        pushfirst(result, (q_text, a_text))\n    end\n    \n    reverse(result) # reverse because we are going from the bottom to top.\nend\n```\nThis function splits the markdown text into sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` using regular expressions. Then it iterates over these pairs of sections, extracts their content (everything before the next section), strips leading and trailing spaces and newlines from them, and adds them to a list of tuples. Note that this assumes that each question is followed by an answer and vice versa. \n\nPlease adjust the code according to your specific needs. Also note that it may not work perfectly for more complex markdown texts as it depends on how your markdown is formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":10.650510215,"_type":"aimessage"}]
