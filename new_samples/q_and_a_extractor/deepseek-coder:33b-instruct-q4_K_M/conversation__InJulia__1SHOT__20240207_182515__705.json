[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the following Julia code to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown string by '# Question' and '# Answer'\n    questions = split(md, \"# Question\")[2:end]\n    answers = split(md, \"# Answer\")[2:end]\n    \n    # For each question/answer pair, extract and clean up the text.\n    result = Tuple{String, String}[]\n    for (question, answer) in zip(questions, answers)\n        q_text = strip(split(question, \"\\n\")[1])  # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n        a_text = strip(split(answer, \"\\n\")[1])     # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n        \n        push(result, (q_text, a_text))             # Add the pair to the result.\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are as many `# Question` headers as `# Answer` headers and also that each question is followed by an answer. If you want to handle these cases, you would need a more sophisticated approach. \n\nThis function will not work correctly if the markdown text does not start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. You might want to add error handling for this case as well.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":9.031557709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
