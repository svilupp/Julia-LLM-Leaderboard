Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections. \n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    match = re.search('# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*# Answer\\s*(.*?)$', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if not match:\n        return None\n    question = match.group(1).strip()\n    answer = match.group(2).strip()\n    return (question, answer)\n```\nIn this solution, the regular expression `# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*# Answer\\s*(.*?)$` is used to extract the question and answer text from the markdown string. \n\n- The `(.*?)` in the regular expression matches any character (except for a newline), but as few as possible. This allows us to capture only the desired text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n- The `\\s*` part of the regex is used to match any number of whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newlines. \n- Finally, `$` denotes the end of the string. This makes sure that we are only matching text between `# Question` and `# Answer` at the end of the string.\n- The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to make `.` match any character including a newline. \n\nThen, the extracted question and answer text are stripped of leading spaces using Python's built-in `strip()` function before being returned as a tuple. If no match was found, `None` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":10.337032585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
