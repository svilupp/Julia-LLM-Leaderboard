[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's string processing capabilities along with regular expressions for matching patterns. The function first splits the markdown text into lines. Then, it loops over each line to find Question and Answer sections by checking if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer` respectively. If it finds one of these sections, it sets a flag to indicate that the next non-empty lines should be added to the respective question or answer string.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    is_question, is_answer = false, false\n    for line in split(strip(md), '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            pushfirstnewcell(questions, \"\")\n            is_question = true\n            is_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            pushfirstnewcell(answers, \"\")\n            is_question = false\n            is_answer = true\n        else\n            if is_question\n                questions[1] *= line\n            elseif is_answer\n                answers[1] *= line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(q) for q in reverse(questions)), (strip(a) for a in reverse(answers))\nend\n\nfunction pushfirstnewcell(arr::Vector{String}, val::String)\n    if isempty(arr) || !isempty(arr[1])\n        pushfirstnewcell(arr, \"\")\n    end\n    arr[1] = val\nend\n```\n\nThis function returns a tuple of two iterators. Each iterator yields the questions and answers in the order they appear in the markdown text. If there are more Answer sections than Question sections, the last question will be repeated for all unmatched answers. The function does not consider nested sections or sections other than `# Question` or `# Answer`. \n\nYou can iterate over these to get a tuple for each Q&A pair:\n```julia\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nfor (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)\n    println(\"Question: $q\\nAnswer: $a\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,529],"elapsed":15.309038886,"_type":"aimessage"}]
