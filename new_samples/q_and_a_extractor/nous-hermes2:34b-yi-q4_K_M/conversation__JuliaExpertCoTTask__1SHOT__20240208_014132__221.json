Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use regular expressions (regex) in Julia to identify and extract text between `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. Here's how you could implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    regex = r\"^(\\n*# +[A-Z] +)(.+)\"\n    question, answer = md |> matchall(regex) |> map(x -> x[1]) |> (s -> (strip(replace(s[1], \"\\r?\\n\")), strip(replace(s[2], \"\\r?\\n\"))))\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `matchall` to find all matches of the regex in the given markdown text. The regex pattern `^(\\n*# +[A-Z] +)(.+)` finds lines starting with a newline, then 1 or more spaces, then \"Question\" or \"Answer\" (case-insensitive), followed by any number of characters until the end of the line.\n\nThe result is a vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of two strings: one for the question and another for the answer. We then use `map` to extract only the first element of each tuple (since they are identical) and apply `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from both question and answer texts. Finally, we return a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\nFor example, when you call:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThe function will return `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")` as the answer tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":12.235905122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
