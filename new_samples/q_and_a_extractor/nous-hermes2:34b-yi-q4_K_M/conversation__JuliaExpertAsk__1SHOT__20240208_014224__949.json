Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that extracts questions and answers from markdown formatted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = Vector{String}()\n    answers = Vector{String}()\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        line = strip(line)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            questions = String[line]\n            current_section = \"Question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && current_section == \"Question\"\n            answers = String[line]\n            current_section = \"Answer\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the markdown text. It keeps track of a `current_section` to determine whether it is currently looking for questions or answers. If it finds lines starting with \"# Question\", it adds that line to an array of questions. Similarly, if it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\" and it's in the correct section, it adds that line to an array of answers. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the first question and answer found.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!","status":200,"tokens":[131,299],"elapsed":8.923249111,"_type":"aimessage"}]
