[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Start by defining a function `q_and_a_extractor` which takes the input markdown text `md` as its argument.\n2. Use the `findall` function to locate all lines starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" in the given markdown text. This will return an array of indices where these sections start.\n3. Create a result variable using a comprehension that includes each question section followed by the corresponding answer section. The first part of this tuple is obtained by extracting the substring from the beginning of the `questions[i]` index to the end of the `answers[i]` index for all `i`, except for the last `i` where there won't be an answer section after it.\n4. Apply a map function to each element in the result tuple and use the `strip` function to remove leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer sections.\n5. Return the resulting list of tuples, where each tuple contains the stripped question and answer text for a given markdown section.\n6. Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it on some example inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":12.204010452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
