[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = [s for s in split(md, \"\\n\") if startswith(s, \"# Question\")]\n    answers   = [s for s in split(md, \"\\n\") if startswith(s, \"# Answer\")]\n    \n    return (questions[1][9:end], answers[1][9:end])\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input and returns the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. It does this by first splitting the string into an array of lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. Then it extracts all lines that start with either `# Question` or `# Answer` by using list comprehension:\n- `questions = [s for s in split(md, \"\\n\") if startswith(s, \"# Question\")]`: This gets all lines starting with `# Question` and removes any leading spaces.\n- `answers   = [s for s in split(md, \"\\n\") if startswith(s, \"# Answer\")]`: This does the same thing but for lines starting with `# Answer`.\nFinally, it returns a tuple of the question (`questions[1][9:end]`) and answer (`answers[1][9:end]`) by removing any leading spaces.","status":200,"tokens":[412,322],"elapsed":10.000116307,"_type":"aimessage"}]
