[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets:\n- To split the markdown into lines we can use the `split` function with a regular expression for whitespace characters as delimiter, e.g. `split(md, r\"\\s+\")`.\n- We can then loop over each line and check if it starts with '# Question' or '# Answer' to extract the corresponding question and answer sections using `findfirst` and `split` functions.\n- To remove leading spaces and newlines from extracted text we can use regular expressions again. For example, `replace(line, r\"^\\s+|\\n+\" => \"\")` will remove any leading whitespace or newlines in a line of text.\n\n# Solution:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers   = []\n\n    # Split markdown into lines and check for question/answer sections\n    for line in split(md, r\"\\s+\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question:\")\n            question = strip(replace(line, r\"^\\s*# Question:\\s*\" => \"\"))\n            questions = [question]\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer:\") && questions !== []\n            answer   = strip(replace(line, r\"^\\s*# Answer:\\s*\" => \"\"))\n            answers  = [answer]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return questions[1], answers[1]\nend\n```\nThis function will extract the first question and answer from the markdown text `md`.
