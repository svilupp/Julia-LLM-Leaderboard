[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"We will write a function called `q_and_a_extractor` that takes as input a markdown-formatted string `md`, and returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer as strings. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize variables for storing question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Split the markdown string into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Loop through each line of the markdown string\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        line = strip(lines[i]) # Remove leading spaces and newlines from current line\n\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(join(lines[(i + 1):end], '\\n')) # Join all remaining lines into a single string\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(join(lines[2:i - 2], '\\n')) # Join the lines between the last occurrence of Question and Answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer) # Return the stripped question and answer as a tuple\nend\n```\n\nWe first initialize variables for storing the question and answer strings. Then we split the markdown string into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`. We loop through each line of the markdown string, stripping any leading spaces and newlines from it using `strip(line)`. \n\nNext, we check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, we join all remaining lines into a single string to get the question (for \"# Question\") or answer (for \"# Answer\") by removing leading and trailing empty lines using `join(lines[(i + 1):end], '\\n')` or `join(lines[2:i - 2], '\\n')`.\n\nFinally, we return the stripped question and answer as a tuple using `return (question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,464],"elapsed":13.813223947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
