Read and understand the given markdown-formatted text `md`\n2. Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes the input string `md` as an argument\n3. Split the input string into lines using `split(\"\\n\")`\n4. Iterate through each line to find \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections\n5. Extract the question and answer text, removing any leading spaces and newlines\n6. Return a tuple with the question and answer in the form of `(question, answer)`\n7. Test the function using the provided example data\n8. Check that the solution is correct by comparing it to the expected output\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    question_index = findfirst(line -> startswith(line, \"# Question\"), lines)\n    answer_index = findfirst(line -> startswith(line, \"# Answer\"), lines)\n\n    if isempty(question_index) || isempty(answer_index)\n        return nothing\n    end\n\n    question_start = question_index.next + 1\n    question_end = findnext(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), lines[question_start:end])\n\n    if isempty(question_end)\n        return nothing\n    else\n        question_text = join(lines[question_start:(question_end.prev - 1)], \"\\n\") |> strip\n    end\n\n    answer_start = answer_index.next + 1\n    answer_end = findfirst(line -> startswith(line, \"# Question\"), lines[answer_start:end])\n\n    if isempty(answer_end)\n        return nothing\n    else\n        answer_text = join(lines[answer_start:(answer_end.prev - 1)], \"\\n\") |> strip\n    end\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided example data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output: `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`","status":200,"tokens":[0,588],"elapsed":17.395314187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
