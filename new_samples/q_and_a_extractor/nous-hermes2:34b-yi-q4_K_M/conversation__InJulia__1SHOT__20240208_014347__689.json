If a line starts with '# Question' or '# Answer', it clears the current question or answer strings. Otherwise, if a line does not start with '#', it is appended to the current question or answer string (after stripping any leading spaces).\n\nAfter processing all lines in the markdown text, the function strips any leading spaces from the extracted text and returns a tuple containing both the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":12.039309045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
