[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is my solution to this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for line in split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(split(line, \"\\n\")[2], '*'))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(split(line, \"\\n\")[2], '*'))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nHere's how this solution works:\n- The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown string as input.\n- It initializes two empty arrays, `questions` and `answers`, which will store the extracted question and answer texts respectively.\n- Then it iterates over each line in the markdown text after stripping newlines.\n- If a line starts with \"# Question\", the function removes any leading asterisks from the following line (which might contain the actual question) and appends it to `questions` array.\n- Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", the function again removes any leading asterisks from the following line (which contains the answer) and appends it to `answers` array.\n- Finally, it returns a tuple containing the first question and the first answer extracted from the markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":10.205418322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
