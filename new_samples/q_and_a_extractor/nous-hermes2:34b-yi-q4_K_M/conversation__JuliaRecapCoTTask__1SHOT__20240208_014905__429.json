[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task is clear. To start off with, we can make use of Julia's built-in regex functions to extract questions and answers. We will then create a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in the markdown text as an input and returns a tuple of question and answer extracted from it.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract questions and answers using regex\n    questions = matchall(r\"^# Question[\\s\\S]+?## Answer\", md)\n    answers = map(i->match(r\"## Answer[\\s\\S]+?### \", i)[0], questions)\n    return (map(x->strip(replace(x, r\"^\\#\\s*Question.*$\"m=>\"\")), questions), \n            map(x->strip(replace(x, r\"^\\#\\s*Answer\\s*\\#[\\s\\S]+?### \"m=>\"\")), answers))\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `q_and_a_extractor`, we first use `matchall` to find all lines that start with 'Question' and end before the next line starting with 'Answer'. Then for each such match, we extract the corresponding answer by using `map` and `match` functions. We then remove any leading whitespaces or newlines from both question and answer using strip function.\n\nWe could also include additional error checking to ensure that the markdown text provided has valid questions and answers. However, for simplicity, I will leave this out in this example.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":10.426449776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
