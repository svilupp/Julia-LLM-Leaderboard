[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We iterate through each line in the given markdown text and check if it's a \"Question\" or an \"Answer\" section. If we encounter an \"Answer\" section while already answering, we combine the current question (if there is one) with the answer and store them as a tuple in `result`. We also reset the current question and answer for future use.\n\nIf we encounter a new \"Question\" section, we save any unanswered questions from before and start storing a new question/answer pair. Once all lines are processed, we check if there were any remaining unanswered questions on the stack and add them as empty tuples to `result`. Finally, we return `result` containing all extracted questions and answers in tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[0,607],"elapsed":18.095970949,"_type":"aimessage"}]
