[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then iterates over each line in the provided markdown text, removing any leading and trailing whitespaces using the `strip()` function. The current section is initialized as an empty string. \n\nThe function checks if the current line starts a new section (either \"Question\" or \"Answer\") by comparing it to an empty string. If so, it clears the previous questions or answers vectors and updates the current section accordingly. If the current section is \"Question\", the line content is added to the list of questions; if it's \"Answer\", the line content is added to the list of answers. \n\nFinally, after processing all lines in the markdown text, the function returns a tuple where the question and answer are obtained by selecting the last elements from their respective lists using indexing (`length(questions)`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":15.080420766,"_type":"aimessage"}]
