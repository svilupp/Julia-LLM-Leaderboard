[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem in Julia, we can use regular expressions to extract all lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" and then parse them accordingly. Here is an example function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    matches = matchall(r\"^# (Question|Answer)\\s+(?:\\n([\\s\\S]+))?$\", md; ignorecase=true)\n    for m in matches\n        if m[1] == \"Question\"\n            push!(questions, strip(m[2]))\n        elseif m[1] == \"Answer\"\n            push!(answers, strip(m[2]))\n        end\n    end\n    return (questions[1], answers[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input and returns the tuple of question and answer. The regular expression used in this function matches lines that start with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" followed by an optional blank line and then the actual question/answer content. We extract all such lines using `matchall`, and if a line starts with \"Question\" we append it to the questions array, otherwise, we append it to the answers array after removing any leading whitespace characters. Finally, we return a tuple of the first question and answer from their respective arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":9.086133119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
