Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match lines starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'. Then, using the `match` function you can extract the corresponding text until the next line starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. Here is a sample implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    state = :start\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(r\"^# Question\", line)\n            state = :question\n        elseif occursin(r\"^# Answer\", line)\n            state = :answer\n        elseif state == :question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif state == :answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    return (chomp(question), chomp(answer))  # remove trailing spaces and newlines\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the input `md` into separate lines, then iterates over each line. It has a state variable (`:start`, `:question`, or `:answer`) to keep track of whether it is currently inside a question or an answer section. If it encounters a \"# Question\" line, it sets the state to `:question` and accumulates all following lines into `question` until it reaches a line that starts with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". Similarly for the answer. It also strips leading spaces and newlines from each line when accumulating.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nParis is the capital and most populous city of France.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\nThis would output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris is the capital and most populous city of France.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,483],"elapsed":13.254411738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
