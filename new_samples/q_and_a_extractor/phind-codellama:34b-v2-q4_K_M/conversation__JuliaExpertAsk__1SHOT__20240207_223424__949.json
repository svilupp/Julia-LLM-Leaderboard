Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple way you can achieve this by using Julia's built-in functions for string manipulation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    reading_question = false\n    reading_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            reading_question = true\n            reading_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            reading_question = false\n            reading_answer = true\n        else\n            if reading_question\n                question *= line * \" \"\n            elseif reading_answer\n                answer *= line * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into lines, then it iterates through these lines. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it switches to reading mode for the question. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to reading mode for the answer. When in reading mode, it appends each line to the respective question or answer (after stripping leading spaces). \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there is no additional markdown syntax within questions and answers like nested lists, code blocks etc., and does not cover all possible edge cases. It's a simple illustration of how you might solve this problem with basic string manipulation functions in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.311496819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
