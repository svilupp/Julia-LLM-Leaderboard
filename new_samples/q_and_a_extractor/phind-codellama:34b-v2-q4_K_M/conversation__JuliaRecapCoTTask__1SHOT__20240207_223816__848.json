[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to match and extract patterns from strings. Here's a function that should do what you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    rx_q = r\"^#\\s*Question[^\\n]*\\n(?<question>.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    rx_a = r\"^#\\s*Answer[^\\n]*\\n(?<answer>.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"\n    \n    question = match(rx_q, md, \"s\")\n    answer = match(rx_a, md, \"s\")\n    \n    if question === nothing || answer === nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question[:question]), strip(answer[:answer]))\nend\n```\nHere's how this function works:\n- We define two regular expressions `rx_q` and `rx_a`. The first one looks for lines starting with \"# Question\" followed by any text, and captures everything until the next empty line or the end of the string. The second one does the same for \"Answer\".\n- Then we use `match(::Regex, ::AbstractString)` function to find matches in the input markdown string `md`. We pass \"s\" as a third argument to make `.` match any character including newline.\n- If either question or answer is not found (`=== nothing`), return `nothing`.\n- Otherwise, we strip leading and trailing spaces/newlines from the captured text with `strip()` function and return it as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":9.961580003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
