[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function that performs the task using regex to match the section headers and extract the corresponding content:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    rx = r\"(?s)#\\s*Question\\n.*?#\\s*Answer\\n|#\\s*Answer\\n.*$\"\n    sections = match(rx, md)\n\n    if sections === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\") # or maybe return nothing if you prefer\n    end\n\n    sections = split(sections.match, \"# Answer\")\n\n    question = strip(sections[1][9:end])  # removing \"# Question\"\n    answer = strip(sections[2])          # removing \"# Answer\"\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a single regex pattern to match either the entire text from `# Question` until `# Answer`, or from `# Answer` to the end of the string. This handles two possible cases: whether there is an \"Answer\" section or not. It then splits this matched text into the question and answer parts, removing the section headers and any leading spaces or newlines in the process.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` is a well-formatted markdown string with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" as the section headers. If there are other formats used for these sections, you'll need to adjust the regex pattern accordingly. Also, if there are multiple pairs of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in your input, this function will only return the first pair it finds. If you want to handle multiple such pairs, you may need to modify the function to extract and process all of them.\n\nAs per the special instructions, no additional requirements were provided. So the above solution should suffice as per the current task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":11.083082046,"_type":"aimessage"}]
