[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match the content of Questions and Answers, which are enclosed within `## Question` and `## Answer` until the end of the string or the next `##`. Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    rx = r\"(?<=## Question\\n).*?(?=\\n##|\\z)\"\n    question = strip(match(rx, md).match)\n\n    rx = r\"(?<=## Answer\\n).*?(?=\\n##|\\z)\"\n    answer = strip(match(rx, md).match)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nNote that `strip` is used to remove leading and trailing spaces or newlines. This function assumes that the input markdown text (`md`) has the structure:\n```\n## Question\n... question text ...\n## Answer\n... answer text ...\n```\nIf there are multiple pairs of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" blocks, you need to adjust the regex accordingly. But this is not usually the case in a single document. \n\nPlease note that Regular Expressions can become quite complex quite quickly when trying to parse nested or more complex structures. So for more complicated inputs, it might be beneficial to use a dedicated Markdown parser and not regexes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.376990056,"_type":"aimessage"}]
