Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then, it iterates over each line. If a line starting with \"# Question\" is found, it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Similarly, if a line starting with \"# Answer\" is found, it sets `in_answer` to true and `in_question` to false.\n\nIf `in_question` or `in_answer` is true, respectively, it appends the current line to the question or answer being built up. Once all lines have been processed, it strips leading spaces and newlines from the resulting question and answer strings and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":10.050353671,"_type":"aimessage"}]
