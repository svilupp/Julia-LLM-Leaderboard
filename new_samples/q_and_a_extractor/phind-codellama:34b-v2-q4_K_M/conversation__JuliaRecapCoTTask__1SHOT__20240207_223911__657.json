[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

In particular, you can use `split` to break up the input string into sections based on the section headers (like `# Question` and `# Answer`), and then `strip` to remove leading spaces and newlines from each section. Here is a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    sections = split(md, r\"(?=# (Question|Answer))\")  # Split at section headers\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(section[length(\"# Question\")+1:end])\n        elseif startswith(section, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(section[length(\"# Answer\")+1:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the input string `md` into sections at the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers. Then, it iterates over each section, checking if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a section starts with one of these headers, it strips the header off (along with any leading spaces or newlines) and assigns the rest of the section to either `question` or `answer`, as appropriate. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":8.91422422,"_type":"aimessage"}]
