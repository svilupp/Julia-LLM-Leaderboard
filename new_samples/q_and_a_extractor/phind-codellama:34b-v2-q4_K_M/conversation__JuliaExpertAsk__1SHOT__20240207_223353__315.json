It uses two boolean flags, `in_question` and `in_answer`, to keep track of whether we are currently in a question or an answer section. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. Similarly for lines starting with `# Answer`. When either flag is true, it appends the stripped line to the current question or answer text, separated by spaces. Finally, it returns a tuple of rstrip-ed question and answer text to remove any trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.472418614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
