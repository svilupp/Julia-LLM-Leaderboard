If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. If it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it sets `in_question` to false and `in_answer` to true. For all other lines, if `in_question` or `in_answer` is set to true, it appends the stripped line to either `question` or `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of the strings `question` and `answer`, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed by `rstrip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":9.201596207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
