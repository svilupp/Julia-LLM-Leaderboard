This function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` in your markdown file, as it stops searching once it finds each. If there could be multiple question/answer pairs in the document, you would need a more sophisticated parsing algorithm.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue  # Skip the current line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false  # Stop checking for questions\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            question *= line * ' '  # Add this line to the question\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * ' '    # Add this line to the answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))  # Strip leading/trailing whitespace\nend\n```\nThis function first splits `md` into separate lines, then iterates over each line. If it sees a `# Question`, it starts recording text for the question. When it sees an `# Answer`, it stops looking for questions and starts recording answers instead. It adds each line of text (plus a space) to the current question or answer, depending on which section it's in. Finally, it returns the parsed question and answer, with any leading/trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":10.587474552,"_type":"aimessage"}]
