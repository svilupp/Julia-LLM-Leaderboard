[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using regular expressions to match the sections and `eachmatch` to iterate over all matches. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    rx = r\"^(#\\s*(Question|Answer))\\n*([\\s\\S]*?)(?=^#|$)\"im\n    matches = eachmatch(rx, md)\n\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for match in matches\n        if lowercase(match.captures[2]) == \"question\"\n            push!(questions, strip(match.captures[3]))\n        elseif lowercase(match.captures[2]) == \"answer\"\n            push!(answers, strip(match.captures[3]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        error(\"Number of questions and answers do not match\")\n    elseif isempty(questions) && isempty(answers)\n        return nothing\n    else\n        return (questions, answers)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by searching for lines starting with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by any number of newline characters (`\\n*`), and then capturing all text up to the next line starting with `#` or the end of the string (`(?=^#|$)`). It uses case-insensitive matching (`i`).\n\nIt checks whether there is the same number of questions and answers, and if not, throws an error. If no questions or answers were found, it returns `nothing`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing two vectors: one for questions and one for answers. Each vector's elements are the extracted text from each question and answer section.","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":10.868657388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
