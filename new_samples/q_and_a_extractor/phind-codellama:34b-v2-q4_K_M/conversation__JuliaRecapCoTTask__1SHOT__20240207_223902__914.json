[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, we are asked to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. We need to handle cases where there are multiple questions and answers in the text.\n\nHere is an implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    current_section = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif !isempty(current_section) && isempty(line)\n            push!(current_section == \"question\" ? questions : answers, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if length(questions) != length(answers)\n        error(\"Mismatched number of questions and answers\")\n    end\n    \n    return map((q, a) -> (strip(q), strip(a)), questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the input string into lines. Then it iterates over each line. If the line starts with `# Question`, it sets `current_section` to `\"question\"`. If the line starts with `# Answer`, it sets `current_section` to `\"answer\"`. If `current_section` is not empty and the line is not empty, it pushes the line into either `questions` or `answers` array depending on the value of `current_section`.\n\nFinally, it checks if there are equal number of questions and answers. If there aren't, an error is thrown. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing all the questions and answers. Each question and answer pair is stripped of leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":12.42260905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
