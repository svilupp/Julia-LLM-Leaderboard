If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Likewise for lines starting with \"# Answer\". When either `in_question` or `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line to either `question` or `answer`. After going through all the lines, it strips any leading spaces from `question` and `answer`, and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's only one \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" section in the input markdown, and that \"# Question\" comes before \"# Answer\". If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.419155972,"_type":"aimessage"}]
