[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The special instructions are not provided, so I will proceed with the assumption that there is no need for any additional functionality beyond the problem description.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        else\n            if in_question\n                question *= line * '\\n'\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= line * '\\n'\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a string `md` as an argument. The string is split into lines and the program loops through each line. If the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets the `in_question` flag to true and resets the `in_answer` flag to false. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets the `in_answer` flag to true and resets the `in_question` flag to false. For every other line, if `in_question` is true, it appends the line to the `question` string; if `in_answer` is true, it appends the line to the `answer` string. Finally, it returns a tuple of stripped question and answer strings.\n\nThis solution assumes that there is only one \"# Question\" and one \"# Answer\" section in the input string, and they are not nested inside other sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":11.372946615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
