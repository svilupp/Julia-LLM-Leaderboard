[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following Julia function will do what is required:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    flag = false\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            flag = true\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            break\n        elseif flag && isempty(line)\n            continue\n        elseif flag\n            question *= line * '\\n'\n        end\n    end\n    for line in reverse(lines)\n        if occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            flag = true\n        elseif occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            break\n        elseif flag && isempty(line)\n            continue\n        elseif flag\n            answer = line * '\\n' * answer\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates through them. When it encounters a line containing `# Question`, it starts appending the following lines to `question` until it encounters a line containing `# Answer`. Then it stops. Similarly, it goes in reverse order to find the answer, appending the preceding lines to `answer` until it encounters `# Question`. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of `question` and `answer`, with any leading/trailing spaces removed using the `strip()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[401,333],"elapsed":9.603418869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
