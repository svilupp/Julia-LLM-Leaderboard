If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. If it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it does the opposite. When either `in_question` or `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line to the respective string, after removing leading spaces and newline characters. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple, after stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's only one `# Question` and `# Answer` in your markdown text, and that `# Question` always precedes `# Answer`. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.43263018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
