[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using the `occursin` function to find the starting and ending indices of each section in the markdown, then use `split` function to divide the sections into an array, and finally use comprehension to strip leading spaces and newlines from each section. Here is a Julia implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question_start = occursin(\"# Question\", md)\n    answer_start = occursin(\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    if !question_start || !answer_start\n        return (\"\",\"\") # Return empty strings if either section is missing\n    end\n    \n    question_end = something(findnext(isequal('\\n'), md, question_start), 0) - 1\n    answer_end = something(findnext(isequal('\\n'), md, answer_start), lastindex(md))\n    \n    questions = strip.(split(md[question_start:question_end], '\\n'))\n    answers = strip.(split(md[answer_start:answer_end], '\\n'))\n    \n    return (questions[2], answers[2]) # Assuming the actual text starts from 2nd line\nend\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the actual text of each section starts from the second line, following a one-line header. The function returns a tuple containing an empty string for either question or answer if the respective section is not found in the input markdown `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":9.156428502,"_type":"aimessage"}]
