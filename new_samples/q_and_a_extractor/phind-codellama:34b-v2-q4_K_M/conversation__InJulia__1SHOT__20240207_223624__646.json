It uses a state machine to determine whether it is currently inside a question or an answer, and appropriately appends the current line to either `question` or `answer`. Note that we also strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using `rstrip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":7.168901753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
