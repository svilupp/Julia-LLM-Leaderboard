Here is an example of how you might write your `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        else\n            if in_question\n                question *= line * \" \"\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= line * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and resets `in_answer`. Likewise for `# Answer`. When either flag is true, it appends the current line to either `question` or `answer`, respectively. After the loop finishes, it returns both question and answer after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":8.56035792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
