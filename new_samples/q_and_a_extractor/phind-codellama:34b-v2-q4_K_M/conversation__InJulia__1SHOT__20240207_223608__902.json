[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function that does exactly what you described:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        else\n            if in_question\n                question *= replaceFirst(line, \"    \" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= replaceFirst(line, \"    \" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove trailing newline characters\n    question = rstrip(question, '\\n')\n    answer = rstrip(answer, '\\n')\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown string into lines and then iterating over each line. It uses two boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of whether we're currently in a Question or Answer section. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false, and when it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it does the opposite.\n\nWhen `in_question` or `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line (with leading spaces removed) to either `question` or `answer`. At the end of the function, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer as strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":11.250169706,"_type":"aimessage"}]
