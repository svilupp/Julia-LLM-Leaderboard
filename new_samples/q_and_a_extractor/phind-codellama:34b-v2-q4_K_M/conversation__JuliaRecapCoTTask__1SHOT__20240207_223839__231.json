[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem is asking to write a function that processes a markdown-formatted text and extracts all the text in the sections Question and Answer, which start with # Question and # Answer, respectively. The extracted texts need to be returned as a tuple of strings. Leading spaces and newlines should be removed from the extracted texts.\n\nHere is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    current_section = :none\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, \"\")\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, \"\")\n            current_section = :answer\n        else\n            if current_section == :question\n                questions[end] *= line\n            elseif current_section == :answer\n                answers[end] *= line\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(questions[1]), strip(answers[1]))\nend\n```\nIn this solution, the function first splits the markdown text into lines. Then it iterates through each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it changes the current section to either `:question` or `:answer`, and pushes an empty string onto the corresponding list (`questions` or `answers`). If the line doesn't start with a header, it appends the line to the text of the current question or answer. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the first (and only) question and answer, after stripping leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":10.75586667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
