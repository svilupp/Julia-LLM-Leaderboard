It splits the input markdown-formatted text into an array of lines.\n2. It then loops through each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it switches to appending text to `question`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it switches to appending text to `answer`. If it's in the process of appending, it checks if the current line starts with `#` and if not, appends the stripped line to the corresponding `question` or `answer` variable.\n3. Finally, it returns a tuple with the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":8.834405449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
