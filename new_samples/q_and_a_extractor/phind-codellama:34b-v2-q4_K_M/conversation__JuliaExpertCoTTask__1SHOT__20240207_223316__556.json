If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it starts reading the question. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it stops reading the question and starts reading the answer. All other lines that are part of either the question or the answer are appended to the respective string variable, with a space added at the end of each line to ensure words aren't glued together. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped (to remove leading/trailing spaces) question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":8.306738904,"_type":"aimessage"}]
