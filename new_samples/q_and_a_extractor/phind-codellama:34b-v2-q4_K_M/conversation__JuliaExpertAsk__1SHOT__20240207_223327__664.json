When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it starts reading text for the question, and when it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it switches to reading text for the answer. It continues reading on until the end of the input. Note that this function assumes that there is exactly one `# Question` and one `# Answer` line in the input, and all lines between these two are part of the respective section. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n42. Obviously!\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"42. Obviously!\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[131,387],"elapsed":10.793531175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
