[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to match the question and answer sections:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    rx = r\"(?:^# Question\\n)(.*?)\\n(?:# Answer|$)|\\n# Answer\\n(.*)\"\n    m = collect(eachmatch(rx, md))\n    question = strip(m[1].captures[1])\n    answer = strip(m[2].captures[1])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the lines starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". The `eachmatch` function is used to find all matches in the input string. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that there are exactly two sections: `# Question` and `# Answer`, and they occur in this order. If these sections may occur multiple times, or if their order may vary, additional steps will be needed to handle those situations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":5.913995134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
