It uses the Markdown.jl package to tokenize the input text into different elements like headings, paragraphs, etc. Then it iterates through the tokens, checks for \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headers, extracts the content of these sections and stores them in separate arrays. Finally, it returns the last question and answer as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces or newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown text will have \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headings properly formatted and that the content of each section is continuous i.e., not split across multiple paragraphs within a single section. The function also does not handle nested lists, images, or other complex Markdown elements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":12.571589382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
