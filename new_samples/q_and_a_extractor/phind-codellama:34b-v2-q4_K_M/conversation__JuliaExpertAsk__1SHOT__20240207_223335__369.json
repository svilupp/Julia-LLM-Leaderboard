The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. \n\nThe `match` function returns a `RegexMatch` if it finds a match or nothing if it doesn't. To handle this, we use the ternary operator `?` to return an empty string when no match is found (i.e., `isnothing(question)` or `isnothing(answer)` is true).\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no nested headers (headers within a header) in the markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":8.942236349,"_type":"aimessage"}]
