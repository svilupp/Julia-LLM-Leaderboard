If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and `in_question` to false, then continues to the next line.\n\nIf `in_question` is true, it appends the current line to `question`, and likewise for `answer` if `in_answer` is true. The use of `continue` causes it to skip to the next iteration of the loop without processing the remainder of the current iteration.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple consisting of the stripped `question` and `answer`. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.","status":200,"tokens":[101,357],"elapsed":9.888700271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
