[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll first need to split the markdown content by newline characters. Then, we can iterate through each line of the content to identify sections that start with either `# Question` or `# Answer`. \n\nHere's a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    current_section = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        else\n            if current_section == \"question\"\n                push!(questions, strip(line))\n            elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n                push!(answers, strip(line))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (join(questions, \"\\n\"), join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by: \n- Splitting the input markdown text into lines.\n- Initializing two empty strings to store questions and answers respectively.\n- Iterating through each line of the content.\n- If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `current_section` to \"question\". If it starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `current_section` to \"answer\". Otherwise, it adds the line (with any leading spaces or newlines stripped) to either the question or answer based on the value of `current_section`.\n- After processing all lines, it returns a tuple containing the joined questions and answers. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation assuming that each `# Question` and `# Answer` is followed by the respective content in the next line(s). It may not work correctly if there are more complex structures in the input markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":11.784314007,"_type":"aimessage"}]
