It keeps track of whether it is currently inside a question or an answer section using the Boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer`. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question` to false and `in_answer` to true. If a line is empty, it continues to the next line. Otherwise, if `in_question` is true, it appends the line to the `question` string. If `in_answer` is true, it appends the line to the `answer` string. Finally, it returns the `question` and `answer` strings with any leading or trailing spaces removed by using the `strip()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":9.090503841,"_type":"aimessage"}]
