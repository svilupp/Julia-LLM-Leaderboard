It assumes that there is no other content in the markdown document that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If your document has other headings that start with these strings, you may need to modify the regular expressions used here.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= line * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looping over each line of the input string. It keeps track of whether it is currently inside a question or an answer with the `in_question` and `in_answer` variables, respectively. When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. When it sees a line starting with `# Answer`, it does the opposite. When it is in either a question or an answer, it appends the current line to that item, after removing any leading spaces or newlines. The result is returned as a tuple of strings with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":9.417036212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
