[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question || in_answer\n            # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n            line = strip(line)\n            if in_question\n                question *= line * \" \"\n            else\n                answer *= line * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThe function takes a markdown-formatted text and splits it into lines. It then iterates over the lines, checking for the markers `# Question` and `# Answer`, which indicate whether we are in a question or answer section. If we are in either a question or answer section, we strip leading spaces and newlines from the current line and append it to the appropriate string variable. After iterating through all the lines, we return the question and answer as a tuple, with any trailing spaces stripped using `rstrip`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input markdown is formatted correctly with `# Question` and `# Answer` markers starting new sections and that there are no other occurrences of these strings in the text. If the input format may vary, you would need to modify this function to handle those variations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":9.755640806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
