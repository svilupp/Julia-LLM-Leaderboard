It sets flags when it encounters a `# Question` or `# Answer` line and unsets the answer flag when it encounters an answer to avoid appending to the answer after encountering the next question. It concatenates the current line to either `question` or `answer`, depending on the set flag(s), then trims leading/trailing spaces and newlines from the resulting strings before returning them as a tuple.\n```julia\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France? \n\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Outputs: (\"What is the capital of France? \", \"Paris\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":8.712234214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
