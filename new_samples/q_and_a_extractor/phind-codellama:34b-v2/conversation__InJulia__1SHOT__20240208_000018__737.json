[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question || in_answer\n            # Remove leading '#' and ' ' or '#' and ' ' up to 6 characters for markdown format\n            line = strip(line[7:end])\n            if in_question\n                question *= line * \" \"\n            else\n                answer *= line * \" \"\n            end\n        elseif !isempty(line) # If the line is not empty but doesn't start with a # Question or Answer\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all lines in the input string and checking if they start with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If a line starts with one of these, it sets `in_question` or `in_answer` to true, which indicates that any subsequent lines should be added to the current question or answer.\n\nThe text for each question and answer is accumulated in the `question` and `answer` variables respectively. The function then returns a tuple containing these two strings after stripping leading spaces and newlines. \n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no other markdown headings (starting with '#') other than \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It also assumes that there is exactly one space between the '#' and the actual text of the heading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":11.02241985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
