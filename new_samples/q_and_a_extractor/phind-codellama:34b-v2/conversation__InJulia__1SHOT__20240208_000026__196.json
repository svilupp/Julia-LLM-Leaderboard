Then, we iterate over each line and check for lines containing \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". When we find a line with \"# Question\", we start recording the question, and when we see a line with \"# Answer\", we stop recording the question and start recording the answer. We also strip any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text using `rstrip()`. Finally, we return the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.042194455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
