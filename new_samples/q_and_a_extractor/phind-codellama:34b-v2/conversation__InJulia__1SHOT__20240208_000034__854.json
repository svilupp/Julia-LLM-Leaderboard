Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can create such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    state = :start\n\n    for line in lines\n        if state == :start && startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            state = :question\n        elseif state == :question\n            question = strip(line)\n            state = :answer\n        elseif state == :answer && startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            state = :done\n        elseif state == :answer\n            answer = strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input text into lines and iterating over them. It uses a `state` variable to keep track of whether it's currently in a question or an answer, starting with `:start` and transitioning between `:question`, `:answer`, and `:done`. Whenever it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it knows that the following lines will be the question. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it knows that the following lines will be the answer until it reaches the end of the document or another `# Question` section. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":7.935114278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
