It keeps track of whether it's currently in a question or answer section using boolean flags (`reading_question` and `reading_answer`). If it encounters a new section, it stops reading the current one and starts reading the next. When it reaches the end of the markdown text, it stops reading entirely.\n\nFinally, it trims any trailing whitespace or newlines from the question and answer before returning them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":9.033641696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
