[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Julia function that does exactly what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and skips to the next line.\n\nWhile `in_question` is true, it appends each line to the `question` string (after stripping leading spaces and newlines). Likewise, while `in_answer` is true, it appends each line to the `answer` string.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer. Note that this function assumes that questions and answers are not nested, i.e., there is only one \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" section in the input markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[0,377],"elapsed":9.662664388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
