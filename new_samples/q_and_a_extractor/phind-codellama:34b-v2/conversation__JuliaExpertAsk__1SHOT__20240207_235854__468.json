It sets a flag `collecting` to `true` when it encounters a \"# Question\" line, and breaks the loop when it encounters a \"# Answer\" line. When `collecting` is `true`, it appends the current line to either the question or answer, depending on whether the question field is empty or not. Finally, it returns the parsed question and answer, with any leading spaces or newlines stripped using the `strip()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":6.322694474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
