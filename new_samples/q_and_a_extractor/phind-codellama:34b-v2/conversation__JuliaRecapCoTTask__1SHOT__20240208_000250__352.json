[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, we'll be using Julia's built-in functions for handling strings and regular expressions. Here is a simple solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question || in_answer\n            if !isempty(line) && line[1] == '#'\n                break\n            end\n            \n            if in_question\n                question *= line * \" \"\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= line * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines and iterates through them. It keeps track of whether it is currently inside a question or answer block using the `in_question` and `in_answer` variables, which are toggled when the corresponding section headers (`# Question`, `# Answer`) are encountered. The text for each question and answer is accumulated in the respective string variable. Finally, leading spaces and newlines are stripped from the extracted text before it is returned as a tuple.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France? \n\n# Answer\nParis is the capital of France. \n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris is the capital of France.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[13,430],"elapsed":11.178969079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
