When it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. Likewise for `# Answer`. When either `in_question` or `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line (with leading '# ' and whitespace stripped) to either `question` or `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of the question and answer.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[101,458],"elapsed":11.724087393,"_type":"aimessage"}]
