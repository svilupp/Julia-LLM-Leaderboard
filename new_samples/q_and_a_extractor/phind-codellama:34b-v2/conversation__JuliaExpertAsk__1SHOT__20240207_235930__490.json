You will then iterate over these sections and extract the content corresponding to \"Question\" and \"Answer\".\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    sections = split(md, r\"^#\\s\", multiline=true)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for (i, section) in enumerate(sections)\n        if i == 1 || isempty(section)\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        header, content = split(section, \"\\n\", limit=2)\n\n        if startswith(header, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(content)\n        elseif startswith(header, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(content)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is an answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md) # returns (\"Question 1\\nThis is a question.\", \"Answer\\nThis is an answer.\")\n```\nNote that the regular expression `r\"^#\\s\"` matches lines starting with `#` followed by a whitespace character. The function `split` is used to divide the input markdown content into sections based on these headers. Each section is then further split into header and content using the `\"\\n\"` delimiter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":9.25037941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
