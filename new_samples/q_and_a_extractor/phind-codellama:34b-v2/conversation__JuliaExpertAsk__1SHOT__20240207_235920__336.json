Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in functions for string manipulation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question || in_answer\n            if !isempty(line) && line[1] == '#' continue; end # Skip headers of other sections\n            if in_question\n                question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer)) # Remove trailing spaces and newlines\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input markdown string. It uses two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to determine whether the current line belongs to a question or an answer, based on the previous line (i.e., whether it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`). Whenever it encounters a new section that's not either a question or an answer, it stops collecting text for the current question and answer. It then returns the collected questions and answers as a tuple of strings, with any leading spaces and newlines removed.\n\nThis solution assumes that there will be exactly one line starting with `# Question` and one line starting with `# Answer`, and that these lines will not appear within code blocks or other markdown sections.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":10.327951554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
