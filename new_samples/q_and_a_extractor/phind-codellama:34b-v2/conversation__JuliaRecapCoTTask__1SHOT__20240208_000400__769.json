[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem can be solved using Julia's built-in functions for string manipulation. Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_question = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n        else\n            answer *= replace(line, r\"^[ \\t]*\" => \"\") * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into an array of lines. It then iterates over these lines, checking if each line marks the beginning of a question or answer. If it does, it toggles the `in_question` flag and continues to the next line. Otherwise, it appends the current line to either the `question` or `answer`, depending on the state of the `in_question` flag, after removing leading spaces and/or tabs. Finally, it returns a tuple consisting of the rstrip'ed `question` and `answer`.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhy is Julia fast?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is fast because it is a high-level, high-performance programming language. It allows for low-level control for performance-critical code while also providing a convenient, high-level syntax.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will return:\n```julia\n(\"Why is Julia fast?\\n\", \"Julia is fast because it is a high-level, high-performance programming language. It allows for low-level control for performance-critical code while also providing a convenient, high-level syntax.\\n\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,488],"elapsed":12.557771214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
