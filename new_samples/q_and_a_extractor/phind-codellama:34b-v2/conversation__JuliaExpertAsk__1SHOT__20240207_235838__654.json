Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to match the lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer` and then extract the corresponding text in between these markers. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inside_question = false\n    inside_answer = false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inside_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inside_question = false\n            inside_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if inside_question\n            question *= line * \" \"\n        elseif inside_answer\n            answer *= line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each line of the input string and checks if it's a line that starts a question or answer section. It uses two flags `inside_question` and `inside_answer` to determine whether it should be currently in a question or answer section. If it is, then it appends the current line to either the question or answer string (with a space for separation).\n\nFinally, it returns both strings after stripping any leading or trailing spaces. Note that this function assumes that there are no other uses of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the text, and that the content of each section is on a single line. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need to adjust the regular expression used or otherwise modify the logic of the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":9.145513119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
