It uses two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether we're currently in a Question or Answer section. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false, and vice versa for `# Answer`. It adds non-header lines to the current question or answer (skipping leading spaces and newlines) until it exits the section. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped question and answer.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no other uses of `#` within questions or answers (besides markdown headers). If that's not guaranteed, you may need to modify this function to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":10.131548352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
