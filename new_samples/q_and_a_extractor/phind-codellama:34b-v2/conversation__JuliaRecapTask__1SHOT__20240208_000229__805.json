[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_question = false\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            break\n        end\n        if in_question\n            question *= \" \" * lstrip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= \" \" * lstrip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the input `md`. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. It then appends any subsequent lines to either `question` or `answer`, depending on `in_question`, until it reaches a line starting with `# Answer`. At that point, it stops processing and returns the question and answer as a tuple. Any leading spaces or newlines are stripped from each line before being added to the question or answer using `lstrip(line)`. After appending a line, a single space is added to ensure words are not concatenated together without separation. Finally, any trailing spaces or newlines are removed from the question and answer using `rstrip` before they are returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":8.376685565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
