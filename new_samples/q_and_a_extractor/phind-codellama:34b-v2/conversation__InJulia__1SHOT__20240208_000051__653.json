[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could define `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= line * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input string. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Likewise, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and skips to the next line.\n\nAs it iterates over the remaining lines, if `in_question` is true, it appends the current line to `question`. If `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line to `answer`. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of the stripped `question` and `answer`, with all leading and trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":8.538905122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
