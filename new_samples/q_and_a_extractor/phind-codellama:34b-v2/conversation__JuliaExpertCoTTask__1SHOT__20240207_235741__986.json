When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and when it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and `in_question` to false. For all other lines, if `in_question` is true, the line is added to the question (after being stripped of leading spaces and newlines) and if `in_answer` is true, the line is added to the answer. After processing all lines, the function returns a tuple of the question and answer with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.\n```julia\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")) # Output: (\"What is the capital of France? \", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":9.552780586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
