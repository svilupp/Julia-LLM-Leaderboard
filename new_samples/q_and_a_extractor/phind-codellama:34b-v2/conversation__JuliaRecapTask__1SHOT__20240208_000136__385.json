[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It keeps track of whether we're currently in a Question or Answer section using two Boolean variables `in_question` and `in_answer`. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question = true` and `in_answer = false`, and when it sees a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_question = false` and `in_answer = true`.\n\nInside the Question or Answer section, it appends the current line to either `question` or `answer`, respectively. This is done by checking if `in_question` or `in_answer` is set, and then concatenating the current line to either `question` or `answer` after stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer as strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,440],"elapsed":11.275257107,"_type":"aimessage"}]
