[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution for your problem. This function uses regular expressions to match the markdown headers (denoted by `#`) and extracts the subsequent text until another header is found or the end of the string. It will ignore any leading whitespace or newline characters after each match.\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    r = r\"(?<=#\\sQuestion\\n).*?(?=\\n#|\\z)\"\n    question = match(r, md)\n    \n    r = r\"(?<=#\\sAnswer\\n).*?(?=\\n#|\\z)\"\n    answer = match(r, md)\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question_text = strip(question.match, [' ', '\\n'])\n    answer_text = strip(answer.match, [' ', '\\n'])\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\nPlease note that the `match` function may return `nothing` if it doesn't find a match in the input string. It is advisable to handle this case according to your needs. In this code, I'm assuming there will always be matches for question and answer. If you want to account for the possibility of missing answers or questions, you should add proper error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":7.484190229,"_type":"aimessage"}]
