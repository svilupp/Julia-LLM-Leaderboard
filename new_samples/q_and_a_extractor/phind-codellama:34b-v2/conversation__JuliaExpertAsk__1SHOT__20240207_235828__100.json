It sets a flag `reading` to track whether it's currently in a Question or Answer section, and adds each non-empty, non-whitespace line to the current question or answer string (with a trailing space for separation), until it hits an empty line, a line starting with \"# Answer\", or the end of the lines. Finally, it returns the rstrip()ed question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":10.233077966,"_type":"aimessage"}]
