[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`. The function uses regular expressions to match lines starting with '# Question' or '# Answer'. It assumes that each question or answer starts immediately after '# Question' or '# Answer', without any spaces or newlines, and continues until the next such line or the end of the text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = eachmatch(r\"^# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|$)\", md, \"s\")\n    answers = eachmatch(r\"^# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n# Question|$)\", md, \"s\")\n    \n    result = []\n    for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)\n        push!(result, (strip(q.captures[1]), strip(a.captures[1])))\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function returns a Vector of Tuples where each tuple contains the question and answer extracted from the markdown text. \n\nPlease note that this simple implementation may not work correctly if your markdown file has a different format than expected, for example, if '# Question' or '# Answer' appears within a code block or some other context where it shouldn't be interpreted as a question or answer. You might need to adjust the regular expressions or add additional logic depending on the exact format of your markdown files.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.054686256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
