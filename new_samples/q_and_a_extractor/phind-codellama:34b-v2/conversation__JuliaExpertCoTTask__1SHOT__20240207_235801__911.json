Here's how you might write `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question || in_answer\n            if line == \"\" && !in_question # ignore empty lines between question and answer\n                continue \n            end\n            \n            if in_question\n                question *= strip(line) * \" \" # add to the existing text, with a space in-between\n            elseif in_answer\n                answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer)) # remove trailing spaces and return as tuple\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line of the input string. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it sets `in_question` to true and `in_answer` to false. When it sees a line starting with `# Answer`, it does the opposite. It then adds any subsequent non-empty lines to either `question` or `answer`, depending on which is currently being tracked, with a space in between each addition to build up the full text of the question and answer. Finally, it trims trailing spaces from both `question` and `answer` before returning them as a tuple. \n\nNote: This function assumes that questions and answers are separated by at least one empty line, as in your provided example. If there might be no empty lines between parts of the same question or answer, you can modify the function to handle this situation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":11.488421428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
