[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia using regular expressions to find the questions and answers, and `strip` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    rx_q = r\"#\\s*Question\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=#|$)\"\n    rx_a = r\"#\\s*Answer\\n*(.*?)\\n*(?=#|$)\"\n    question = strip(match(rx_q, md)[1])\n    answer = strip(match(rx_a, md)[1])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted text as its input. It defines two regular expressions to match the content under \"Question\" and \"Answer\" headings. The `.*?` pattern is used to match any character (except for a newline) 0 or more times, but as few times as possible, allowing it to capture multi-line content. The `strip` function is then used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the matched strings.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes there is exactly one set of Question and Answer headings in your markdown text. If there are multiple sets, you will need a more complex approach such as using `eachmatch` instead of `match`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":7.766097443,"_type":"aimessage"}]
