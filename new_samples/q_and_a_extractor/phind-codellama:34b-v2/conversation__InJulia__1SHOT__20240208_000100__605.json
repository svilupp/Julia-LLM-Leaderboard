[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    recording_question, recording_answer = false, false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            recording_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            recording_answer = true\n            recording_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if recording_question\n            question *= line * \" \"\n        elseif recording_answer\n            answer *= line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input markdown string. If it encounters a line starting with `# Question`, it begins recording the question. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it stops recording the question and starts recording the answer. Any lines that are part of the question or answer have leading spaces and newlines removed before being added to the respective string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhy is the sky blue?\n\n# Answer\nThe sky is blue because...\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: Why is the sky blue?\nAnswer: The sky is blue because...\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":9.584815878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
