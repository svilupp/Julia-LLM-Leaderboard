It then iterates over each line and checks if it starts with a `# Question` or `# Answer` header using the `startswith` function. If the line does start with such a header, it sets the corresponding variable (`question` or `answer`) to the current line (without leading spaces or newlines). Finally, it returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[145,309],"elapsed":7.477473388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
