If it does, it sets a flag indicating whether we are currently in a question or answer section. If we are in a question or answer section, it appends the current line to the corresponding variable without leading spaces or newlines. At the end of the loop, it returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[145,275],"elapsed":6.664788355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
