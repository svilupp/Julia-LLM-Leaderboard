[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the extracted text\n    result = []\n\n    # Split the markdown text into separate lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate over each line and extract the question and answer sections\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        line = strip(lines[i])\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            result.push(strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted text as a tuple\n    return (result[1], result[2])\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown text into separate lines using `split`. It then iterates over each line and extracts the question and answer sections by checking if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a section is found, it adds the extracted text to an array called `result`. Finally, it returns the extracted text as a tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text follows the standard format of having a single question per line and a single answer per line, and that there are no blank lines between the questions and answers. If your input text deviates from this format, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[107,321],"elapsed":7.723013579,"_type":"aimessage"}]
