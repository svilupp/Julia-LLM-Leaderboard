If it does, the corresponding variable is set to the trimmed text after \"Question:\" or \"Answer:\". Finally, the function returns a tuple of the question and answer variables.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\n# Define the markdown text as a string\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer: Paris\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the q_and_a_extractor function and print the result\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,475],"elapsed":11.404887014,"_type":"aimessage"}]
