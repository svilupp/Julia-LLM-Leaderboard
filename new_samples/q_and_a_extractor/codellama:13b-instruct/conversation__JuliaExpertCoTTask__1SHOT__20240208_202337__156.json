The `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a markdown-formatted text string as input and returns a tuple containing the question and answer in the format `(question, answer)`.\n2. We use the `eachline` function to iterate over each line of the input string.\n3. For each line, we check if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, we extract the text after the hash symbol using `strip(line[# Question: end])` or `strip(line[# Answer: end])`, respectively.\n4. We store the extracted question and answer in the variables `question` and `answer`.\n5. At the end of the function, we return a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input markdown text follows the format you provided, with each question and answer separated by a newline character `# Question` or `# Answer`. If the input text does not follow this format, the function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[247,351],"elapsed":8.645225064,"_type":"aimessage"}]
