It then extracts the question and answer from each section by matching the beginning of the section with the regular expression `r\"^# Question: (.*)\"` and `r\"^# Answer: (.*)\"`, respectively, and captures the text following the \"#\" character using parentheses.\n\nFinally, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using `map` and `strip`. The resulting question and answer tuples are returned by the function.\n\nYou can call this function with a markdown-formatted string as input, like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer 1\nParis\n\n# Question 2\nWhat is the largest planet in our solar system?\n\n# Answer 2\nJupiter\n\"\"\"\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions: $questions\")\nprintln(\"Answers: $answers\")\n```\nThis code will output:\n```julia\nQuestions: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\")\nAnswers: (\"Paris\", \"Jupiter\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,489],"elapsed":11.656566585,"_type":"aimessage"}]
