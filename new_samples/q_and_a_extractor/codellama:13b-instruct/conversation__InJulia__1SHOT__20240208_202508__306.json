[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(line)[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(line)[2])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the input markdown text `md` into individual lines using the `split` function. It then iterates over each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the relevant section of the text and stores it in the appropriate variable (`question` or `answer`). Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown text is correctly formatted and contains only one Question and Answer section each. If the input text does not conform to this format, the function may produce incorrect results.","status":200,"tokens":[107,262],"elapsed":6.289317383,"_type":"aimessage"}]
