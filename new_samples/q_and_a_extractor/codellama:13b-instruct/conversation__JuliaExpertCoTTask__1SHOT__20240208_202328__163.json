If it is, it sets the corresponding variable and strips any leading spaces and newlines from the line before returning the tuple of question and answer at the end.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text will always be in the format provided in the task, with each question and answer on a separate line and separated by `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. If the format is different, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[247,350],"elapsed":8.573017462,"_type":"aimessage"}]
