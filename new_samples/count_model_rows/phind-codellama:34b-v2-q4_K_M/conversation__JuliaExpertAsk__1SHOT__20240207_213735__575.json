Here's a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    result = Dict{String, Int}()  # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the result\n    \n    for g in grouped\n        result[g.model[1]] = length(g)   # Add model and its row count to the dictionary\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input, groups it by the `:model` column, iterates over each group, counts rows in each group, and stores the results in a Dict.\n\nHere's how you can use this function with your `df_cars`:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is already defined\nrow_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nfor (model, count) in row_counts\n    println(\"Model: \", model, \" - Count: \", count)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":7.441419833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
