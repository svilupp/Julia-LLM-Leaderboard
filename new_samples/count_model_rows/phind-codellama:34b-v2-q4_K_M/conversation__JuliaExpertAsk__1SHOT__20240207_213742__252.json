Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows in each group (i.e., the number of cars for each model). The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a car model and the count of cars for that model.\n\nYou can use this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nNow, `result` is a new DataFrame where each row gives the model and the count of rows (number of cars) for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.508392572,"_type":"aimessage"}]
