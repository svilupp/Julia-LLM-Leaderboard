Then, we use `combine` to calculate the number of rows in each group (using `nrow`) and rename this new column to `:count`. The result is a DataFrame with two columns: `:model` and `:count`, where `:count` represents the number of occurrences of each car model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":7.108026009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
