We will need the DataFrames library for our task. Then, we'll create a function `count_model_rows` that accepts a DataFrame and groups it by the `model` column, then calculates the number of rows for each model. The result will be a new DataFrame that contains the unique models in df_cars and the count of their occurrences.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    result = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the function\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this code, `groupby` is a function that groups the input DataFrame by the specified columns (in our case, `:model`). It returns a GroupedDataFrame. The `combine` function then takes the GroupedDataFrame and applies the `nrow` function to each group (to get the number of rows in the group), giving us a new DataFrame that has one row for each model with a count of its occurrences.\n\nThe output should be:\n```julia\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model    count  \n     │ String   Int64 \n─────┼──────────────────\n   1 │ a4           3\n   2 │ a6           1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":9.692244767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
