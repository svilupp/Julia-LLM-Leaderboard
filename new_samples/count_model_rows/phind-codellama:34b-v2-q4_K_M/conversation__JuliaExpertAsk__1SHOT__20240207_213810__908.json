Here is a sample implementation of the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    result = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\"], price=[1000, 2000, 1500, 2500, 3000])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis function works by first grouping the data by the `:model` column, and then combining each group into a single row that contains the number of rows in that group (computed using `nrow`). The result is returned as a new DataFrame.\n\nIn the example usage, it creates a DataFrame `df_cars` with two columns, `:model` and `:price`. After calling `count_model_rows(df_cars)`, it will return a DataFrame that tells us how many rows there are for each model:\n\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model    count\n     │ String   Int64\n─────┼─────────────────\n   1 │ A            3\n   2 │ B            2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":9.082355929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
