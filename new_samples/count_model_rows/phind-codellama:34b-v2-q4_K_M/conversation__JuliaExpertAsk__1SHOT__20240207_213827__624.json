The result is a dictionary where keys are the models and values are the corresponding counts. \n\nFor example, if you have the following DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"], other_column=1:6)\n```\n\nCalling `count_model_rows(df_cars)` will return a dictionary like `Dict(\"A\"=>3, \"B\"=>2, \"C\"=>1)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":7.137628593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
