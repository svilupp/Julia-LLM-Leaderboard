This is done using the `groupby` function to partition the data into groups, and the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group.\n\nThe example usage creates a DataFrame `df_cars` with two columns, `:model` and `:price`, and then calls `count_model_rows` on this DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame `result` contains the count of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":8.342710235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
