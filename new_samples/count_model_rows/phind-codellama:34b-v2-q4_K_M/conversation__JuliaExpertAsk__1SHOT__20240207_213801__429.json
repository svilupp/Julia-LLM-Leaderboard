The `groupby` function is used to partition the data into groups, and the `length` function is used to count the number of rows in each group.\n\nNote: In this example, we are using a simple DataFrame with only one column (\"model\"). The function should work with any DataFrame as long as there is a column named `:model`. If the column name is different in your DataFrame, you can replace `[:model]` with `[:your_column_name]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.276975331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
