Here is the code you would use in Julia to create a function named `count_model_rows` which takes a DataFrame as input and returns another DataFrame with the count of rows for each model:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return by(df, :model, df -> size(df, 1))\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `by` function from DataFrames.jl package to group data by `:model` and then applies a function that returns the number of rows in each group (`size(df, 1)` gives the number of rows in a DataFrame). The result is a new DataFrame with model names and their respective counts.\n\nYou can use this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nNow, `df_counts` will be a DataFrame with 2 columns: `:model` and `:x1`, where `:x1` contains the counts of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":6.866648398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
