Here we are splitting the data frame by the `:model` column and applying the `size` function to get the number of rows for each model. This results in a new data frame where each row represents a unique car model and the count of rows for this model.\n\nThis function can be used as follows:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"], price=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])\nres = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(res)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model     x1   \n    ├─────────┼─────┤\n    │ A        │ 3   │\n    │ B        │ 2   │\n    │ C        │ 1   │\n```\nHere `x1` is the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":9.363970739,"_type":"aimessage"}]
