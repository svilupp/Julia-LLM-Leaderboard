Here is an example of how you could define the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |> length => x -> x[2]\nend\n\n# Testing\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n    model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"],\n   mpg=[18, 24, 16, 26, 22, 19]\n)\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Number of rows for each model: \", result)\n```\nThis function first groups the data by the `:model` column and then uses `length` to calculate the number of rows in each group. The result is a dictionary with the model as key and the count as value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":5.835799543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
