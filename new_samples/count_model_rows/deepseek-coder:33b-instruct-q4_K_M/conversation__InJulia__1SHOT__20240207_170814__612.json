Here is an example of such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nThis `count_model_rows` function works as follows:\n\n1. It first groups the data by unique models (the `groupby(df, :model)` part). This returns a GroupedDataFrame where each group contains rows with the same model.\n2. Then it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow => :count` transformation on these groups. The `nrow` function counts the number of rows in a group and the `=> :count` syntax renames this result column from `:x1` (which is the default name) to `:count`.\n3. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, where `count` contains the number of rows for each model in the original dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":7.156258623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
