Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df['model'].value_counts()\n```\n\nThis function will return a Series, where the index are the unique models and the values are the counts of each model. For example, if your DataFrame `df` has 5 rows with 'model' = 'Toyota', then `count_model_rows(df)['Toyota']` would be equal to 5.","status":200,"tokens":[0,129],"elapsed":3.64005268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
