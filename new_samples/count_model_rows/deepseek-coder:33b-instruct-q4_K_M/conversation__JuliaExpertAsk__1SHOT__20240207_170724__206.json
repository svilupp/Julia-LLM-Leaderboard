Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\nIn this code, we are first grouping our dataframe by `model` column and then counting the number of rows in each group. The function `combine()` is used to create a new dataframe with count values for every group. \n\nNote: This assumes that your DataFrame df_cars has a column named 'model'. Also, Julia uses 1-based indexing unlike Python which uses 0-based indexing. So you might need to adjust the code slightly depending on how you've structured your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":5.255498377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
