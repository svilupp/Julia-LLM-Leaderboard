Here's an example function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CSV\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    # Group data by model using 'by', then compute the size of each group using 'size'.\n    return by(df, :model, df -> size(df,1))\nend\n```\nThis function will give you a DataFrame where for each model, it gives the count of rows. \n\nThe `:model` symbol refers to the column named `model` in your data frame. You can replace this with the actual name of your column if it's different. The argument `df -> size(df,1)` is an anonymous function that computes the number of rows in each group. \n\nRemember to include necessary packages at the start. Here, I used DataFrames and CSV for reading data from a csv file into a dataframe but not essential if you're already working with a DataFrame object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":7.044682986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
