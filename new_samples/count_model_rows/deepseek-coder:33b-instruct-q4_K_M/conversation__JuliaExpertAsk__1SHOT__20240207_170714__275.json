Here is a function which does exactly that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df.groupby('model').size()\n```\n\nThis will return you a Series where the index are the unique model names and the values represent how many rows there are for each model. \n\nLet's say your DataFrame `df_cars` is:\n\n```python\ndata = {\n    'model': ['Audi', 'BMW', 'Mercedes', 'Ford', 'BMW', 'Mercedes'],\n    'year': [2018, 2056, 2045, 2034, 2023, 2012],\n    'price': [70000, 90000, 100000, 30000, 80000, 60000]\n}\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data)\n```\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```python\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nAnd it will output:\n\n```\nmodel\nAudi         1\nBMW          2\nFord         1\nMercedes     2\ndtype: int64\n```\nSo, the function counts how many rows there are for each unique model in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":9.992886032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
