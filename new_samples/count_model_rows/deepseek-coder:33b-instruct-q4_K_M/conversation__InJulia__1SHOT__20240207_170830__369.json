Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames # Make sure DataFrames is loaded\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    counts = by(df, :model, df -> length(df))[:, [1,2]]\n    rename(counts, Dict(:x1 => :Model, :x2 => :Count))\nend\n```\nIn the function `by()`, the first argument is your DataFrame and the second argument is a vector of columns to group by. The third argument is a function that is applied to each subset of the data. In this case, it's just the length function which returns the number of rows in each subset.\n\nThe `rename()` function from the DataFrames package is used to rename the columns as per your requirement. \n\nNote: This function assumes that the column `model` exists in the provided DataFrame and no error checking or exception handling is performed for this assumption. You may want to add checks for these conditions if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.833100584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
