Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis function works by first grouping the dataframe `df` by `:model`, then counting the number of rows in each group using `nrow => :count`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row corresponds to a unique value of `model` and the number of times that model appears in `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":5.540370071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
