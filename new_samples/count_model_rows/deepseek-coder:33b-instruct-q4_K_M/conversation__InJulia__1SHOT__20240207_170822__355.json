It then applies the `nrow` function to each group to count the number of rows in that group. \n\nThe result is a new `DataFrame` with two columns, one for the `:model` and one for the row counts (named :count). If you want to get an actual dictionary from this DataFrame, you can use the following function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows_dict(df::DataFrame)\n    return Dict(eachrow(count_model_rows(df)))\nend\n```\nThis will convert each row of the DataFrame into a pair in a dictionary, with `:model` as the key and `:count` as the value. Please note that you need to make sure that your DataFrame has a column named `model` for this function to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":7.579881775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
