It uses the groupby and size functions in DataFrames package of Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame) \n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nIn this function, we group the dataframe `df` by `:model` using `groupby(df, :model)`. Then we calculate the number of rows for each group with `nrow => :count` inside `combine()` function. The result is a DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":5.929819085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
