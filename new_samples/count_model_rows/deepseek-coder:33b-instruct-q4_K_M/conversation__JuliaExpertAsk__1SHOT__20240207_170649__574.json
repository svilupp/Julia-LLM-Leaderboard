Here is an example function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df.groupby('model').size()\n```\nThis function will return a Series where the index are the unique model names and the values are the number of rows for each model in your DataFrame. \n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['Toyota', 'Honda', 'Ford', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'Honda']})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nmodel\nFord       1\nHonda      2\nToyota     2\ndtype: int64\n```\n\nWhich means there are 2 rows for the 'Toyota' model, 2 rows for the 'Honda' model and 1 row for the 'Ford' model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":7.815133061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
