The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a different `model` and the corresponding count. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(model=[\"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"BMW\", \"Honda\"])\ncount_result = count_model_rows(df)\nprint(count_result)\n```\n\nThis will output a DataFrame with two columns, `model` and `count`. The first row should be for Honda with a count of 2, the second for Toyota with a count of 1, and so on.","status":200,"tokens":[90,229],"elapsed":6.619341795,"_type":"aimessage"}]
