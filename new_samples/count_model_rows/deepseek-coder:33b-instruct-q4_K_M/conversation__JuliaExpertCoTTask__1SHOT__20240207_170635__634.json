I am assuming that `DataFrames` package has been installed and imported already. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# create a dataframe df_cars\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# call the function on df_cars\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nIn this code, `groupby(df, :model)` groups the dataframe by 'model' column. Then, `combine()` is used with `nrow => :count` to calculate how many rows there are for each grouped model. It creates a new DataFrame where it counts the number of rows per unique value in the `model` column. The result will be:\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count \n     │ String  Int64 \n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ a4         3\n   2 │ a6         1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":8.054000065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
