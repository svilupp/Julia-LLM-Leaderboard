The resulting dataframe will have a column of models and their corresponding row counts.\n\nLet's test the function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"]) # create your example DataFrame\ncount_model_rows(df_cars) \n```\nThis should return a dataframe with two columns: `model` and `count`. The `model` column will have unique car models from the original dataframe, while the `count` column will show how many rows there are for each model in the original dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":9.151014339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
