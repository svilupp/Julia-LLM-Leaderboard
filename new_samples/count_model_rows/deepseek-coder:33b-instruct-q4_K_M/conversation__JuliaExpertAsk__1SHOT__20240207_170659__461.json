The function count_model_rows takes a DataFrame df as input and returns a new DataFrame grouped by `model` with counts of rows for each model.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `combine` is used to apply a function (here, `nrow` which counts the number of rows in each group) on each group. `:model` refers to column `model` in DataFrame df. \n\nHere is how you can use the function with an example DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(make=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\"], model=[\"Corolla\", \"Civic\", \"Sentra\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will print:\n\n```julia\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model   count\n     │ String  Int64\n─────┼──────────────\n   1 │ Corolla      1\n   2 │ Civic        1\n```\nPlease note that you need to have the DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not, you can add it using Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":9.446166832,"_type":"aimessage"}]
