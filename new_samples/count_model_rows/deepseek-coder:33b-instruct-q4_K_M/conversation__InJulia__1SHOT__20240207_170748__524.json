This way you get a DataFrame with unique models and their respective row counts. \n\nPlease note that you need to have the DataFrames package installed in Julia for this to work. If you haven't done so, please add it using:\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":4.95350122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
