Test the function by passing `df_cars` as an argument:\n```julia\n# Step 6 - Test the function by passing df_cars as an argument\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n@show count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe output should be:\n```\ncount_model_rows(df_cars) = DataFrame(Model = [\"a4\", \"a6\", \"q7\"], Count = [3, 1, 1])\n```\n\nBy following this approach and using the provided data, we have created a function `count_model_rows` that correctly counts the number of rows for each model in a given DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":14.907311414,"_type":"aimessage"}]
