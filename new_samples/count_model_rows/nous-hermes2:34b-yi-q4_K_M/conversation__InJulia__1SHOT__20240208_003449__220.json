It then creates an empty vector with the same length as the number of unique models. This is used to store the counts for each model. The `filter!` function filters the DataFrame based on the current model, and the count is updated accordingly. Finally, a new DataFrame is created with the models as the first column and the counts in the second column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":6.059280282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
