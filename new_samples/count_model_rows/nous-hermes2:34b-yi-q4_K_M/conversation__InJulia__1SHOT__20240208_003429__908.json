It then calculates the length of each group (i.e., how many rows are there for each model) using the `groupby` function from the DataFrames package.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `df_cars` DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe resulting `df_counts` will be a new DataFrame containing the grouped data and the corresponding row counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[58,213],"elapsed":6.302465175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
