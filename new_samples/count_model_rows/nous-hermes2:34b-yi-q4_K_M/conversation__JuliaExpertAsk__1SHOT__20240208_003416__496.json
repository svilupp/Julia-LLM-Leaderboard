Then it applies the `length()` function to each grouped result, which gives us the number of rows for that particular model. Finally, we use `collect()` to convert this into a vector of row counts, which can be easily accessed or printed as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,119],"elapsed":3.448490807,"_type":"aimessage"}]
