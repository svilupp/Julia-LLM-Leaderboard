Here's the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = size.(eachrow.(grouped), 1)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `count_model_rows` takes a DataFrame named `df_cars` as input.\n- We use the `groupby` function to group the data by the 'model' column.\n- Then, we apply the `eachrow` iterator on the grouped result and extract its size using the `size` function. This gives us an array of counts for each model.\n- Finally, we return this array containing the count of rows per model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":5.010251417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
