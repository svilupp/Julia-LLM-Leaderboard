Then it applies the `combine` function to group the results from `groupby` and computes the number of rows for each group (which is essentially counting all values in each model) with the `nrow` function, finally passing this result through `identity` to keep it as a DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame named `model_counts` has columns `:model` and `:n` where `:n` stores the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":5.248267099,"_type":"aimessage"}]
