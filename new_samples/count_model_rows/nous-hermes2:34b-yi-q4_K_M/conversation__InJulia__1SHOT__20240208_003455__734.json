Each element in this array represents the count of rows for that particular model.\n\nTo use this function with your own DataFrame, you can simply call it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = # Your DataFrame goes here\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nThis will print an array of the counts for each model in the `model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":5.795959918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
