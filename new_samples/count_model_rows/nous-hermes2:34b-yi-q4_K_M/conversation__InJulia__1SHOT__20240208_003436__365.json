Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = []\n    for (model, model_df) in groupby(df, :model)\n        push!(counts, length(model_df))\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can now use this function by passing your DataFrame df_cars as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = # Your DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will print a vector containing the number of rows for each model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":6.026246327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
