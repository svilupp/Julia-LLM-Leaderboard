It uses Julia's DataFrames package to group the data by the \"model\" column and then calculates the number of rows in each group using the `combine` function. The result is stored in a new DataFrame with one row per model, showing how many rows there are for that particular model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":4.77884786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
