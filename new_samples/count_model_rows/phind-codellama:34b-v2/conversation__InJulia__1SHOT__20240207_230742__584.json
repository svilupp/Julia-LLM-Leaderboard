Here's how you can write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model and then count number of rows for each model\n    gd = groupby(df, :model)\n    combine(gd, nrow => :counts)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input, groups it by the `model` column, and then calculates the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function inside `combine`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row indicates the model and the corresponding count of rows.\n\nYou can use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\ncounts_df = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nNow, `counts_df` will contain the model and its corresponding counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":6.165798467,"_type":"aimessage"}]
