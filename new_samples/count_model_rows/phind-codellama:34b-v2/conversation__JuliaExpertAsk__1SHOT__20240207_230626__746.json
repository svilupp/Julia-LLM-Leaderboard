It then calculates how many rows there are for each group using `size(df, 1)`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a model from the original DataFrame and the count of its occurrences.\n\nNote: Remember to have `using DataFrames, Statistics` at the top of your script or notebook when using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":5.25602274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
