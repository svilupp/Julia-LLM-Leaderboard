The `nrow` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group, which are saved under a new column called `:Count`.\n\nThe output will be a DataFrame with two columns: one for the car model and another for the count of that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":6.988401791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
