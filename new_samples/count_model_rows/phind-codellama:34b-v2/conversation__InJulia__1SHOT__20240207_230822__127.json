Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming you have a DataFrame df_cars with column `model`\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model and then calculate the number of rows for each group\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    combined = combine(grouped, nrow => :counts)\n\n    return combined\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the data by the `model` column and `combine` combines each group into a single row. The `nrow` function is used to calculate the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a `model` from the original DataFrame along with the count of rows for that model.\n\nYou can then call this function using your `df_cars` DataFrame like so:\n\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a `model` from the `df_cars` DataFrame along with the count of rows for that model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":7.234121801,"_type":"aimessage"}]
