You can install it using the following command:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\nNow you can write the function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    model_counts = combine(grouped, nrow => :counts)\n    return model_counts\nend\n\n# example usage:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"])  # sample DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis function groups the data by the `:model` column and then uses `combine` to count the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique car model and the number of occurrences of that model in the original `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":6.386423535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
