The result is another DataFrame where each row represents a unique `model`, and there's a new column that counts how many rows there are for each model. \n\nNote: This will return a grouped DataFrame, not a count directly. You can convert this to a dictionary or another form as needed. For example, to get a Dictionary of models and their row counts you can do:\n\n```julia\nmodel_counts = Dict(row[:model] => row[:x1] for row in eachrow(result))\n```\n\nWhere `:x1` is the name of the new column added by the `groupby` function, which contains the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":7.197924196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
