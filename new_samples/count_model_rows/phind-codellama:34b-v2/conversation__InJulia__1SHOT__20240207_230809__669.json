Here is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |>\n           groupby(_.model) |>\n           combine(nrow)\nend\n\n# Example usage\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n    model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"],\n    price = [1000, 2000, 1500, 3000, 4000, 1800],\n    year = [2010, 2015, 2017, 2005, 2008, 2011]\n)\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nIn the `count_model_rows` function, first we use the `groupby` function to split the DataFrame into sub-dataframes based on unique `model`. Then, the `combine` function is used with `nrow` function as an argument which calculates the number of rows for each model. The result will be a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique car model and the number of occurrences of that model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":8.403973202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
