Here's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), :model => (x -> nrow(x)) => :count)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a sample DataFrame\n\n# Create a DataFrame similar to df_cars\nmodel_data = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"]\ndf_cars = DataFrame(:model => model_data)\n\n# Call the function\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `groupby` function groups the data by the :model column and the `combine` function is used to apply a function to each group. In this case, the function `(x -> nrow(x))` is applied, which counts the number of rows in each group. The result is then returned as a new DataFrame where each row represents a model and its count.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":6.507621066,"_type":"aimessage"}]
