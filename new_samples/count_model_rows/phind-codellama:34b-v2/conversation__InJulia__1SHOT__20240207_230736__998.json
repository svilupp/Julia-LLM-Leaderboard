Here is an example:\n\nFirst, make sure to have the DataFrames package loaded:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n```\n\nSuppose we have the following DataFrame `df_cars`:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\n    model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"],\n    price = [1000, 2000, 1500, 2500, 1800, 3000],\n    year = [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2013, 2012]\n)\n```\n\nNow, let's define the function `count_model_rows`:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |>\n        map(nrow) |>\n        Dict\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input, groups it by the `:model` column and applies `nrow` to each subgroup, returning a dictionary where the keys are the models and the values are the numbers of rows for each model.\n\nYou can call this function with `df_cars`:\n```julia\njulia> count_model_rows(df_cars)\nDict{Any,Int64} with 3 entries:\n  \"A\" => 3\n  \"B\" => 2\n  \"C\" => 1\n```\nAs you can see, the output is a dictionary with the models as keys and the numbers of rows as values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":10.62765695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
