Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    combined = combine(grouped, nrow => :counts)\n    return combined\nend\n\n# Testing the function with some data\nRandom.seed!(123) # for reproducibility\nmodels = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = rand(models, 10), price = rand(10))\ndisplay(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis code first groups the data by the :model column and then combines each group into a new DataFrame where the number of rows in each group is counted and stored under a new column named :counts. The function is then tested with some random example data. \n\nPlease make sure to have the DataFrames package installed (`using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":6.837615001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
