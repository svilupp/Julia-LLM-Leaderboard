The `combine` function then creates a new DataFrame, where each row corresponds to a group and the number of rows in that group is stored in the `:counts` column.\n\nThe result will be a DataFrame with 2 columns: `model` and `counts`, where `counts` indicates the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[62,233],"elapsed":6.003171944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
