Here is an example of how you could implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics \n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    result = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return result\nend\n\n# example usage:\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `count_model_rows` that takes in a DataFrame, groups it by the `:model` column, and then calculates the number of rows in each group using `nrow`. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a model from the original DataFrame and the corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":5.792157409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
