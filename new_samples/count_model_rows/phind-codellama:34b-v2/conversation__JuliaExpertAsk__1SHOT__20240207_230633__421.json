Here's an example of a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |> x -> combine(x, nrow => :count)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\"],\n                    price = [1000, 2000, 1500, 3000, 2500, 1800])\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nIn the above example, `groupby` splits the DataFrame into groups based on unique model names. The `combine` function then creates a new DataFrame where each group is represented once, with additional columns calculated for each group. In this case, it counts the number of rows in each group and adds it to the resulting DataFrame under the `:count` column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":6.666198459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
