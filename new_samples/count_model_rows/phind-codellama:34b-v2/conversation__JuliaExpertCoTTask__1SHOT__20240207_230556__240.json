Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |>\n        combine(nrow) |>\n        sort!\nend\n\n# example usage\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input, groups it by the `:model` column, and then combines each subgroup into a new DataFrame where each row represents a model and the number of rows in the original dataframe for that model. The `sort!` at the end sorts this new dataframe by the `:model` column.\n\nFor example, if your input is:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n```\nThe output will be:\n```\n3×2 DataFrames.DataFrame\n│ Row │ model │ x1     │\n├─────┼───────┼────────┤\n│ 1   │ \"a4\"  │ 3      │\n│ 2   │ \"a6\"  │ 1      │\n│ 3   │ \"q7\"  │ 1      │\n```\nThis means there are 3 rows with model \"a4\", 1 row with model \"a6\", and 1 row with model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":9.691218432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
