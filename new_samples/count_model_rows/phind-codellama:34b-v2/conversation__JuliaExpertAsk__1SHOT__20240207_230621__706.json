Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame as an argument, groups it by the `model` column using `groupby`, and then uses `combine` to create a new DataFrame where each row represents a group and the number of rows in that group is calculated with `nrow`. The result is saved under the `:count` symbol.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\"], other_data=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nnew_df = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\n`new_df` will be a DataFrame with two columns, `model` and `count`. For the example data, it would look like this:\n\n| Row | model | count |\n|-----|-------|-------|\n| 1   | A     | 3     |\n| 2   | B     | 2     |","status":200,"tokens":[93,325],"elapsed":8.35278916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
