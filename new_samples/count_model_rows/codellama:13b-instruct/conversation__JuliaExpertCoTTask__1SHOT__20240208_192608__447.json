The resulting `GroupedDataFrame` object is then iterated over using a list comprehension and the length of each group is calculated using the `length` function. Finally, a new `DataFrame` is created with the model names and counts.\n\nNote that this code assumes that there are no duplicate model names in the input DataFrame. If there are duplicates, you may need to modify the code to handle them.","status":200,"tokens":[219,228],"elapsed":5.641439633,"_type":"aimessage"}]
