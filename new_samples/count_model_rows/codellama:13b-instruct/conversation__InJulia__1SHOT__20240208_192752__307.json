The `nrow` function is then applied to each group to get the number of rows for that group. Finally, the results are returned as an array.\n\nYou can also use the `count` function from the Statistics module to count the number of rows in each group:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"], year=[2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019], color=[\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"black\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return count.(grouped)\nend\n\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,367],"elapsed":8.754074753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
