Here's an example function that does this:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return map(g -> length(g), grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` as input and groups the data by the `model` column. It then uses the `map` function to apply the `length` function to each group, which returns the number of rows in each group. The resulting vector is returned as the output of the function.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\"], year=[2015, 2016, 2017])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis would output a vector with the number of rows for each model: `[2, 1, 1]`.","status":200,"tokens":[68,248],"elapsed":5.922316817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
