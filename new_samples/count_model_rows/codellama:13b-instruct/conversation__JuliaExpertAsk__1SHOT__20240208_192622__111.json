Then, it applies the `nrow` function to each group in the grouped DataFrame to calculate the number of rows for each group. Finally, it returns a new DataFrame with the results.\n\nNote that this implementation uses some recent features of Julia, such as the dot syntax for method calls and the use of the `eachcol` function from the Statistics package to extract the columns of the grouped DataFrame. If you're using an older version of Julia, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[107,218],"elapsed":5.265941186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
