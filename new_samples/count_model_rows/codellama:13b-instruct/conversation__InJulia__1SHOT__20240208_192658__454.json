It then defines a function called `count_model_rows` that takes in a dataframe as an argument. Inside this function, it groups the data by model using the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl, which returns a new dataframe containing one row per unique value of `model`. The number of rows for each group can then be calculated by using the `size` function on the grouped dataframe. Finally, the function returns the resulting vector of numbers.\n\nThe test line at the end calls the function with the sample dataframe and prints the output. You can adjust this code to suit your needs, such as changing the variable names or adding additional columns to the dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[68,364],"elapsed":8.606155323,"_type":"aimessage"}]
