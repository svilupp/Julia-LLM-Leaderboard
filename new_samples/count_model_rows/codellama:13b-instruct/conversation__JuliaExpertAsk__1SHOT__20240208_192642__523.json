Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group and returns a new DataFrame with this information.\n\nFor example, if we have the following DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Honda Civic\", \"Toyota Corolla\", \"Ford Focus\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Toyota Corolla\"])\n```\nWe can use the `count_model_rows` function to group the data by model and calculate the number of rows for each:\n```julia\ndf_grouped = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(df_grouped)\n# Output:\n#    model  | count\n# ------------------\n# Honda Civic    2\n# Toyota Corolla 2\n# Ford Focus     1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,279],"elapsed":6.682782676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
