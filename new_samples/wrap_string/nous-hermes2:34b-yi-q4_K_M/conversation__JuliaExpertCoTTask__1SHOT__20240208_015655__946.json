Define the function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional parameter for text width (default to 10).\n2. Split the input string into individual words.\n3. Iterate over each word in the list.\n4. If the current line length plus the next word would exceed the maximum allowed text width, start a new line with a space.\n5. Keep track of the lines and their contents as we go along.\n6. Once all words have been processed, join the lines together to form the final wrapped string.\n\nHere's the code for `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the input string into individual words\n    words = split(input_str, r\"\\s+\")\n    \n    lines = [\"\"] # Initialize an empty line as the first one\n    current_line = lines[end]\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            # Exceeding maximum width, start a new line\n            push!(lines, \"\") # Add an empty string as the next line\n            current_line = lines[end] # Move to the newly added line\n        end\n        \n        append!(current_line, word * ' ') # Append the current word to the end of the line\n    end\n    \n    # Join all lines together (remove trailing whitespace before joining)\n    final_str = join(lines, \"\\n\")\n    while occursin(' ', final_str[end])\n        pop!(final_str) # Remove trailing space from the end of the string\n    end\n    \n    return final_str\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test this function with the provided input:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap words\ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,475],"elapsed":13.949795933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
