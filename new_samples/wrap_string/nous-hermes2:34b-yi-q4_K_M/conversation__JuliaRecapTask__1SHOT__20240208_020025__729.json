[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function returns the wrapped string as an iterable collection of lines.\n\nThe main idea is to split the input string into words, iterate over them one by one, and decide whether to add each word at the end of a new line or append it to the current line. We use `split` to divide the original string (`s`) into individual words. \n\nWe then proceed through each word in the `word` iterator variable. If the last line (at index `end`) is empty or adding this word would not exceed the desired text width, we append it directly to the current line by concatenating with a space character. \n\nHowever, if adding this word would exceed the text width, we create a new line and add both the current word and any remaining words from the previous line (which were moved to the next line) to this new line. This ensures that each line remains within the desired text width constraint.\n\nFinally, after iterating through all words in `s`, we return the concatenated lines using `join(lines)`.","status":200,"tokens":[373,400],"elapsed":12.213704429,"_type":"aimessage"}]
