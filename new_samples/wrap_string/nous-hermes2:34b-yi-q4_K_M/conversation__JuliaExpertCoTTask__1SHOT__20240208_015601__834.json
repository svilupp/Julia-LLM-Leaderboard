It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

Define the `wrap_string` function that takes in a string and the maximum text width as arguments.\n2. Split the input string into an array of words using the `split` function.\n3. Iterate over each word and check if appending it to the current line will exceed the max text width.\n4. If the total length exceeds the max text width, add a new line with a space at the beginning and continue with the next word.\n5. If there are no more words or we have reached the end of the input string, return the final output as a single string.\n\n# Code:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    output = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if (output != \"\" && length(output) + length(word) > text_width) || output == \"\"\n            output *= \"\\n \"\n        end\n        output *= word\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\n# Example:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 12) # Should return \"This function will \\nwrap words into lines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":8.299650509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
