[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\nFirst, we define the function `wrap_string(text, text_width::Int=10)`. This function takes two arguments: a string and an integer which specifies the maximum width of the text. If the second argument is not provided, it will be set to 10 by default.\n\nInside the function, we first initialize an empty string `result` to store our wrapped text and a variable `current_line_length::Int=0` to keep track of the current line length.\n\nWe then split the input text into words using the `split` function. After that, we loop through each word in the text. For each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width (`current_line_length + length(word) > text_width`). If it does, we add a newline character to `result` and reset `current_line_length` to 0. Finally, we add the word to `result` (or a space followed by the word if we're not at the beginning of a line), and update `current_line_length`.\n\nHere's the Julia code that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width::Int=10)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    words = split(text)\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        if current_line_length != 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque ac tellus nisi.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 20))\n```\n\nThis will print the input text but with newlines inserted as necessary to keep each line's length within the specified maximum width.","status":200,"tokens":[0,511],"elapsed":14.201337454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
