Then we iterate over these words and for each word, we check if adding it to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If yes, then we start a new line by writing a newline character to the result buffer. Otherwise, we add the word to the current line by writing the word and a space to the result buffer. Finally, we return the content of the result buffer as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[177,292],"elapsed":8.188044703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
