[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

For each word, it checks whether adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, it appends the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with this word. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line. Finally, it appends any remaining words in the last line and returns all lines joined by newline characters.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ns = \"This is an example string that will be wrapped based on text width.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s, 10))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis is an \nexample \nstring that \nwill be \nwrapped \nbased on \ntext width.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[367,321],"elapsed":9.222327905,"_type":"aimessage"}]
