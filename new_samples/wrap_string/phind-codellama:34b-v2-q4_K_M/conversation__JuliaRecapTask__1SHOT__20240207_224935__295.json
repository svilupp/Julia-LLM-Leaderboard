[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

If adding a word to `current_line` would cause its length to exceed `text_width`, it instead adds `current_line` to the list of lines (`lines`) and starts a new line with the current word. Once all words have been processed, it adds the last line to the list of lines and then joins them together with newline characters between each line.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a long string that will be split into multiple lines because it exceeds the specified text width.\", 20)\n\"This is a long\\nstring that will\\nbe split into\\nmultiple lines\\nbecause it exceeds\\nthe specified text\\nwidth.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":9.914429769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
