If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, the current line is added to the list of lines, and the new word becomes the start of a new line. Finally, the last line is appended (in case it doesn't get added when reaching the end of the string).\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nexample_string = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(example_string)\nprintln(wrapped_string)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill\nwrap\nwords\ninto\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":8.19898796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
