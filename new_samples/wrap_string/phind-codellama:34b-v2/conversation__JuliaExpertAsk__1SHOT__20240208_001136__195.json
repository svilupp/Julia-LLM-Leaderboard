Donec in.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nThe `wrap_string` function splits the input string into words and then iterates over them, adding each word to a line until the maximum text width is reached, at which point it adds the current line to the list of lines (as a new element), resets the current line to empty, and continues this process until all words have been added. If there are any remaining words after the loop finishes, it adds the current line to the list of lines before returning the result. The function uses the `join` function to combine all lines into a single string with newline characters separating each line.\n\nThe example usage of `wrap_string(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec in.\")` would produce output that looks like:\n```\nLorem \nipsum \ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit. \nDonec in.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":10.425913916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
