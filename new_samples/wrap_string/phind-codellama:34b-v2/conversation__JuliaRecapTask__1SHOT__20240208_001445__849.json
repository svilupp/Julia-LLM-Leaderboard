[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If adding a new word would exceed the `text_width`, the current line is saved to an array of lines and a new line is started. After going through all the words, if there's any remaining content in the current line, it's also saved to avoid losing the last line.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ninput_str = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(input_str, 10))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nLorem \nipsum \ndolor  \nsit   \namet,  \nconsectetur\nadipiscing\nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":8.894112417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
