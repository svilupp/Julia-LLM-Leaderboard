For each word, it checks if adding it to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If it would, the current line is added to the list of lines and a new line is started with the current word. If not, the word is added to the current line. After going through all words, any remaining line is also added to the list of lines.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\ns = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\nThis would print:\n```\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit\namet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing elit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[67,345],"elapsed":8.833424513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
