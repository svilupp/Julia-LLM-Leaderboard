Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for the function `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(input_str)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        else\n            push!(lines, lstrip(current_line)) # remove leading space and add to lines\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(current_line) # add the last line\n        push!(lines, lstrip(current_line))\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input string into words. It then iterates over each word, adding it to a line until the maximum text width is reached. When the maximum text width would be exceeded by adding another word, it adds the current line to an array of lines and starts a new line with the current word. After going through all the words, it adds the last line to the array of lines (if there are any remaining). Finally, it joins all the lines together with newline characters in between and returns the resulting string.\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\ninput_str = \"This is a test string for the wrap function.\"\ntext_width = 10\noutput_str = wrap_string(input_str, text_width)\nprintln(output_str)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis is a\ntest string\nfor the\nwrap\nfunction.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":9.61290268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
