If adding the new word would exceed the maximum text width, it starts a new line. After the loop, any remaining words on the current line are added to the list of lines. Finally, all lines are joined into a single string with newline characters between each line.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> s = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\";\n\njulia> println(wrap_string(s, 10))\nLorem ipsum\ndolor sit amet,\nconsectetur\nadipiscing elit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":8.477902347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
