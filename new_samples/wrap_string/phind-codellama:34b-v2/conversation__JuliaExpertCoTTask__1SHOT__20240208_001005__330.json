It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If it would, the current line is saved in the `lines` array and a new line is started with the current word. After the loop, any remaining words are saved as a final line.\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", text_width=10))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap words \ninto lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":6.997749079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
