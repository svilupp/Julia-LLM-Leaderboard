If a word would make the line too long, it starts a new line. The length of each word is calculated as `length(word) + 1` because we need to add an extra space after each word. \n\nYou can use this function with some example text like:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\n\nThe output of the above code will be:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum \ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":9.252107733,"_type":"aimessage"}]
