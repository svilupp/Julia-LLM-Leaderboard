It splits the input string into words. Then it iterates over these words, adding them to the current line if they fit within the maximum width. If a word would make the line exceed this maximum width, it adds the current line (except for its trailing space) to a list of lines and starts a new line with the word. After all words have been processed, any remaining text in `line` is added as the last line if it is not empty. Finally, the function returns the lines joined by newlines, reversing them so that the first input line becomes the first output line (since we built up the list of lines in reverse order).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"This is a test string.\", 10))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis is a\ntest string.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":11.456909784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
