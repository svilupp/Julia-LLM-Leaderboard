Instead, they create new strings, which is not efficient if you need to append to many strings in a loop.\nThe `resize_last_str` function is used to ensure that the last string in the array does not end with a newline character. If it does, we add an extra empty string to the start of the array. This ensures that when we are adding words to the current line, we don't have to worry about checking if the last line ends with a newline or not.\nFinally, the `wrap_string` function splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words and appends each word to the current line. When the length of the current line plus the length of the next word exceeds `text_width`, it starts a new line. This is done by adding a newline character at the start of the array. The final string is built by joining all lines in reverse order.","status":200,"tokens":[175,604],"elapsed":17.505034421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
