If a word would exceed the maximum length, it starts a new line and adds the word there. If the line isn't empty, a space is added after each word.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a test string.\", 10))\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```\nThis is a\ntest string.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":8.716871121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
