It keeps a running total of the length of the current line. If adding a new word to that line would exceed the text width, it starts a new line. Otherwise, it adds the word to the current line with a space before it (except for the first word in each line).\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ninput = \"This is an example string.\"\ntext_width = 10\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(input, text_width=text_width)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe output of this will be:\n\n```\nThis is\nan\nexample\nstring.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":11.438818933,"_type":"aimessage"}]
