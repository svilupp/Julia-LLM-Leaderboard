[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia code for your problem. The function `wrap_string` takes a string and wraps it according to the provided maximum width of each line, in this case 10 characters. It checks if adding the current word will exceed the limit or not. If it does, it adds a newline character before the current word.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(str)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        result *= \"$word \"\n        line_length += length(word) + 1  # +1 for the space between words\n    end\n\n    return strip(result)  # remove trailing whitespace\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test this function with an example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprint(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThe output will be a wrapped version of the input string. The `strip` function is used to remove any trailing whitespace. Note that this simple implementation does not handle edge cases such as words longer than the maximum width, or punctuation at the end of words. For more robust wrapping, you might need to use a more complex approach, possibly involving regular expressions and character counting.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":10.087107038,"_type":"aimessage"}]
