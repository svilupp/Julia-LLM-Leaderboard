[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It keeps adding words to a current line until it exceeds the `text_width` limit, at which point it adds the current line (along with a new line character) to the output and starts a new line. The remaining line, if any, is added at the end.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long text that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe output will look something like:\n\n```\nThis is a\nlong text\nthat\nneeds to be\nwrapped\ninto\nmultiple\nlines.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.790563067,"_type":"aimessage"}]
