If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, it starts a new line and adds the word there. It also takes care of adding spaces between words on the same line and to the start of each new line (except for the first word).\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\ns = \"This is a long string that we want to wrap.\"\nprint(wrap_string(s, 10))\n```\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\nThis is a\nlong string\nthat we\nwant to\nwrap.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":10.114385274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
