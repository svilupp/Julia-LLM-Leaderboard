The words are separated by a newline character (`\\n`). Each subsequent word in the line is separated by a space. If adding a new word would exceed the maximum line length (`text_width=10`), then the function will start a new line and add the word there.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":8.907313089,"_type":"aimessage"}]
