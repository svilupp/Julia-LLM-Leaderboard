[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Here's how you could approach this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    output = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(line) + length(word) > text_width || !isempty(line)\n            # The new word would exceed the width, so start a new line.\n            output *= \"$line\\n\"\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if !isempty(line) && line[end] != ' ' \n            # Add a space between words, unless this is the first word of the line.\n            line *= \" \"\n        end\n        line *= word\n    end\n    \n    output *= line\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input text into individual words and then iterating over them. If adding a new word to the current line would cause it to exceed `text_width`, or if there is already some text on the line, it will print that line and start a new one. It also ensures that there's a space between words unless it's the first word of the line.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This is a sample text for wrapping.\", 10))\n```\n\nWhich should output:\n\n```shell\nThis is a\nsample\ntext for\nwrapping.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":10.371180273,"_type":"aimessage"}]
