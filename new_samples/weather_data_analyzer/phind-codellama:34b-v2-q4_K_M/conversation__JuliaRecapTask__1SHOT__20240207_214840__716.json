[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If the list is empty it returns all values as `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum temperature and checks the trend of temperatures. The trend can be increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\nHere we used the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean (average) and maximum and minimum values from the given list. We also manually checked the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list, assuming that the data is ordered chronologically. If the last element is greater than the first one, it's an increasing trend, if less - decreasing, and if equal - stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":10.21796083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
