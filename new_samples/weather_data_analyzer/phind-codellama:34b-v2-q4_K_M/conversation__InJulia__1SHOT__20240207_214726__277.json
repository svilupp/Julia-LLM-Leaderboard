Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If it is, it simply returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nIf there's data in the list, it computes the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nThe `trend` is determined by comparing the last temperature value with the second-to-last one. If they are equal, the trend is `:stable`. If the last one is greater, it's `:increasing`, and if it's less, it's `:decreasing`. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing all these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":10.026217651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
