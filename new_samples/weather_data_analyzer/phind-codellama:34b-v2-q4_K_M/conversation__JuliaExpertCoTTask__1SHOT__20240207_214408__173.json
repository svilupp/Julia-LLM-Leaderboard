Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Real,1})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the input array is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple where all values are set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and temperature trend (increasing, decreasing or stable). The temperature trend is determined by comparing the first and last temperatures in the array. If the last one is greater, then the trend is increasing; if it's less, then the trend is decreasing; otherwise, the trend is stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.791965076,"_type":"aimessage"}]
