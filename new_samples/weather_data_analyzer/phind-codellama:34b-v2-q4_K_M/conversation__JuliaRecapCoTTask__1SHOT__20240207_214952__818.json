[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` isn't empty, it computes the average temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature using functions from the `Statistics` package (`mean`, `minimum`, `maximum`).\n\nTo determine the trend of the temperature data, the function first creates a list `diffs` containing the differences between consecutive temperatures. It then counts the number of positive and negative differences. If there are more positive differences than negative ones, it sets the `trend` to `:increasing`. If there are more negative differences, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`, otherwise, if the number of positive and negative differences are equal, it sets the trend to `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,485],"elapsed":13.490315475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
