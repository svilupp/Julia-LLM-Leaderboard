Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input temperature list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThen, we calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. \n\nTo determine the trend, we check the number of elements in `temps`. If there's only one element, the trend is stable. Otherwise, if the latest temperature is greater than the first one, we consider this an increasing trend, and likewise for decreasing trends. If the last and first temperatures are equal, we set the trend to be stable.\n\nFinally, the function constructs a named tuple with these values and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":10.122823027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
