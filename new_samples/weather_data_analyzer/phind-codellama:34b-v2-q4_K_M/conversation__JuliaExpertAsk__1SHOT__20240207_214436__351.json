Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Note that we will use the `Statistics` package for some of the basic statistical operations. \n\nFirstly, let's load the package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nThen define our function:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n        minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n        if length(temps) > 1\n            trend = temps[2:end] .> temps[1:end-1] ? :increasing :\n                    temps[2:end] .< temps[1:end-1] ? :decreasing : :stable\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe function checks if the `temps` vector is empty. If it's empty, all values in the returned named tuple are set to `nothing`. \n\nIf there's more than one temperature provided, we determine the trend by checking if each successive day's temperature is greater or less than the previous one. The `:increasing`, `:decreasing` and `:stable` symbols represent increasing temperatures, decreasing temperatures, and stable temperatures (no change) over time, respectively. \n\nIf there's only one temperature provided, we set the trend to `:stable` as we can't determine a trend with a single data point.","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":11.146243663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
