Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using the Julia language:\n\nFirst of all, make sure to import the `Statistics` package which provides functions for performing statistical analysis.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nNow, let's define the function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Number, 1})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; :average => nothing, :max => nothing, :min => nothing, :trend => nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1] && temps[end-1] > temps[end-2]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1] && temps[end-1] < temps[end-2]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; :average => average, :max => max_temp, :min => min_temp, :trend => trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks whether the input array `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nNext, it computes the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThen, it determines the trend of the temperature data. If the length of `temps` is less than 2, the trend is set to `:stable`, as not enough data points are available to determine a trend. Otherwise, it checks whether the temperatures in the last two data points are increasing or decreasing and assigns the corresponding symbol (`:increasing` or `:decreasing`) to the `trend` variable. If neither of these conditions holds (the temperatures are the same in the last two data points), the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the computed average, max, min temperatures and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,519],"elapsed":14.362277709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
