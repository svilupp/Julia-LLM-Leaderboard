Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define such a function using the Julia language:\n\nFirstly, make sure you have installed the Statistics package by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n        minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(temps) < 2  # Not enough data to determine trend\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it's empty, we directly return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we compute average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package respectively. We also determine trend by comparing the first and last elements of `temps` array. Finally, we return results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":9.610992398,"_type":"aimessage"}]
