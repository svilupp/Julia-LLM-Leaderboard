Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

Note that for the trend, we will simply classify it as increasing, decreasing or stable based on the difference between the first and last temperature in the list:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate stats\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Classify trend\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend = temps[1] < temps[end] ? :increasing : (temps[1] == temps[end] ? :stable : :decreasing)\n    else\n        trend = :stable # If only one data point, we consider it stable.\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package to calculate the mean, maximum and minimum temperature respectively. The trend is classified by comparing the first and last temperature in `temps`.","status":200,"tokens":[157,322],"elapsed":9.017143474,"_type":"aimessage"}]
