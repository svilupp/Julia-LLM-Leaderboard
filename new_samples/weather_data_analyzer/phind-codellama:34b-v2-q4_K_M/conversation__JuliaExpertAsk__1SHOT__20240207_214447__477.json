Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of your `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty.

It also determines the trend of the temperature data: if the last element in the list is greater than the second-to-last one, it's increasing; if it's less than the previous one, it's decreasing; otherwise, the trend is stable (the same as the last value). \n\nFinally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,365],"elapsed":10.005350203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
