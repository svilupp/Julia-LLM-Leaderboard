Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia using the `Statistics` package. \n\nFirstly, make sure you have the Statistics package installed by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`.\n\nThen:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    elseif length(temps) == 1\n        return (; average=only(temps), max=only(temps), min=only(temps), trend=:stable)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    if temps[2:end] .> temps[1:end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[2:end] .< temps[1:end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function firstly checks if the input list is empty. If it's empty it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list contains only one element it will return `:stable` for trend as temperature can't rise or fall in this case. Otherwise, the average, maximum and minimum temperatures are calculated directly from the input list using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nTo detect the trend of the temperature data, we compare each pair of successive temperatures. If all pairs are larger, then the trend is `:increasing`. If all pairs are smaller, then the trend is `:decreasing`, and if there's a mix or none of these, then the trend is `:stable`.\n\nPlease note that in real-life scenario weather data usually contains many more variables (like humidity, wind speed, pressure etc.) and such simple analysis could be not enough to determine the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,476],"elapsed":13.072819631,"_type":"aimessage"}]
