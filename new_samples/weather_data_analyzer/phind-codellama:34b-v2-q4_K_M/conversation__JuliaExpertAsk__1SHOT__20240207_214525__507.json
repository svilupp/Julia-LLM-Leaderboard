Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function using the Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif diff(temps)[1] > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff(temps)[1] < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is. Then it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. It also determines the trend of the temperature data: if the difference between the first two elements is positive, it's increasing; if negative, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable. Note that this simple trend analysis doesn't take into account longer-term changes or fluctuations in the data. The function finally returns a named tuple with all these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,348],"elapsed":9.533172233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
