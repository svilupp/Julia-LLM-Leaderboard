[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem using Julia language:\n\n1. First, make sure that the `Statistics` package is installed by running `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`.\n2. Next, start your function with an empty list check. If the list of daily temperature data `temps` is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. Then, calculate the `average`, `max`, and `min` temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n4. To determine the trend of the temperatures, calculate the difference between the first and last temperature in the list. If it's greater than 0, then the trend is `:increasing`, if it's less than 0 - `:decreasing`, otherwise - `:stable`.\n5. Finally, construct and return a named tuple with all calculated values.\n\nHere's the code that implements this logic:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        (; \n            average=mean(temps), \n            max=maximum(temps), \n            min=minimum(temps),\n            trend=(temps[1] < temps[end]) ? :increasing : (temps[1] > temps[end] ? :decreasing : :stable)\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly for any list of daily temperature data and complies with the provided guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":10.261469127,"_type":"aimessage"}]
