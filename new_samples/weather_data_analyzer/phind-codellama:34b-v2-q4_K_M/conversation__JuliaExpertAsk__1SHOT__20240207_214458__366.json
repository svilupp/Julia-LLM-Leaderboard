Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the `Statistics` package for basic statistical functions. The trend is determined by comparing the average temperature with the starting and ending temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; \n            average=nothing, \n            max=nothing, \n            min=nothing, \n            trend=nothing\n        )\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n        minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg < temps[1] && avg < temps[end]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg > temps[1] && avg > temps[end]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; \n            average=avg, \n            max=maximum_temp, \n            min=minimum_temp, \n            trend=trend\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input `temps` list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively. It also checks the trend based on whether the average temperature is greater or less than the first and last temperatures in the list. The `:increasing` trend means that the temperatures have been getting higher, `:decreasing` - lower, and `:stable` - constant over time. \n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,403],"elapsed":11.074735624,"_type":"aimessage"}]
