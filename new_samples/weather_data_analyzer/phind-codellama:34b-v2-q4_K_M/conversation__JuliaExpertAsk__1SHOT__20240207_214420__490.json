Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of how you might write such a function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` is empty. If it is, we simply return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nNext, we calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package, and the minimum and maximum temperatures using the `minimum` and `maximum` functions, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend of the temperature data, we compare the last two elements in the `temps` array. If there are less than 2 elements, we consider the trend to be `:stable`. If the last element is greater than the second-to-last, the trend is `:increasing`. If it's smaller, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if the last two elements are equal, we again consider the trend to be `:stable`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with all of our computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[187,416],"elapsed":11.620366225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
