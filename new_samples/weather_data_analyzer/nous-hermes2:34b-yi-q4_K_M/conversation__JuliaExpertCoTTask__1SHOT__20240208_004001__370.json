Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we need to define our function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean = mean(temps)  # calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # find the minimum temperature\n\n    trend = ifelse(mean == min_temp, :increasing,\n                    ifelse(mean == max_temp, :decreasing,\n                           :stable))  # determine trend based on mean and max/min temperatures\n\n    return (average=mean, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```\n\nThe output will be a named tuple containing the average temperature (`average`), maximum temperature (`max`), minimum temperature (`min`), and trend.
