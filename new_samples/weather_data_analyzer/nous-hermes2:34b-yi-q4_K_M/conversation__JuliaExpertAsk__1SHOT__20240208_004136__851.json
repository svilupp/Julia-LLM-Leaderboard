Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if !isempty(temps)\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        # Check if the average temperature is increasing, decreasing or stable\n        temp_diff = [diff(temps)[end] for diff in DifferenceIterator(temps)]\n        temp_diff_avg = mean(temp_diff)\n        if temp_diff_avg == 0\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif temp_diff_avg > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    else\n        avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend = nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":6.526478196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
