Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Approach\n1. Check if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. Calculate the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. Determine the maximum and minimum temperature by iterating over the temperatures and keeping track of these values.\n4. Analyze the trend of temperatures based on their change between subsequent values in the list, considering it as a sequence of changes. If most of these changes are positive (increase), return `:increasing`; if most of them are negative (decrease), return `:decreasing`; otherwise, if there is an equal number of increases and decreases or no changes at all, return `:stable`.\n5. Construct a named tuple with the calculated values for average, max, min, and trend.\n6.
