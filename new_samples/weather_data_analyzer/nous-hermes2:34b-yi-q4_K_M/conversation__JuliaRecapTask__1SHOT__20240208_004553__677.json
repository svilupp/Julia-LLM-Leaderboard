[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If the list of temperatures is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. Calculate the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. Find the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions, respectively.\n4. Determine the trend of the data by comparing subsequent temperature differences in a sliding window fashion. If more than half of the comparisons indicate an increase, it's an increasing trend. Otherwise, if more than half of the comparisons show a decrease, it's a decreasing trend. Otherwise, it's considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":11.258854935,"_type":"aimessage"}]
