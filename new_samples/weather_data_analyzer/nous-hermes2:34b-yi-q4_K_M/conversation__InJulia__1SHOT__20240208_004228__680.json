If the list is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend is determined based on the slope of the temperature data using the `mean(diff(temps)) / (length(temps) - 1)` formula. If there are only two data points, we can say that the trend is stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":12.594307617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
