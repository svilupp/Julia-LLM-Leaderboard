[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{<:Number})\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics for the list of temperatures\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the temperature trend based on whether average is increasing or decreasing\n    trend = if avg > temps[end]\n        :decreasing\n    elseif avg < temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` and returns a named tuple containing the average temperature (`average`), maximum temperature (`max`), minimum temperature (`min`), and temperature trend (`trend`). If the list is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The trend can only be one of three options: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n\nWe first check if the input is an empty vector, and if so, we immediately return the named tuple with all elements as `nothing`. \n\nNext, we calculate the average temperature using the built-in Julia function `mean()`, the maximum temperature using the `maximum()` function, and the minimum temperature using the `minimum()` function. We also determine the trend by comparing the average to the first and last temperature in the list: if the average is greater than the last temperature, it's decreasing; if it's less than the first temperature, it's increasing; otherwise, it's stable. \n\nFinally, we return a named tuple with all these results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":13.679235542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
