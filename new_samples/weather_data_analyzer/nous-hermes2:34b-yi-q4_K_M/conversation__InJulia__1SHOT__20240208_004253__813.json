Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of `weather_data_analyzer` in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate temperature trend\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif abs(mean(diff(temps))) > 0.5\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif abs(mean(diff(temps))) < -0.5\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will calculate the average temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package, and get the maximum and minimum temperatures with `maximum` and `minimum` respectively. \nFor calculating the trend, it checks if the list has only one element, in which case it's stable. Otherwise, it calculates the mean difference between consecutive elements in the list and compares its absolute value to a threshold of 0.5Â°C. If the mean difference is greater than this threshold, then it's an increasing trend; otherwise, if the mean difference is less than this threshold, then it's a decreasing trend. Finally, it returns all these values as a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` keys. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":11.484309565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
