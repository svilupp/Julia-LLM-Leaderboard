[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

If it is empty, then we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, we calculate the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package. We find the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions respectively. Then, we check if there is an increasing or decreasing trend in the temperatures by iterating through the list starting from the second element. If there are less than 2 elements in the list, then we set the trend to `:stable`. Otherwise, if any pair of consecutive elements has a different value, we set the trend accordingly and break out of the loop. Finally, we return a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,486],"elapsed":14.572311504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
