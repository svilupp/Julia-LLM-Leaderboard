[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since no special instructions are provided, I will proceed using Julia's built-in standard libraries without additional packages and follow the given task steps for problem solving as mentioned in the previous chat. Here is the solution to your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{<:Number})\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics using built-in functions\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Check for increasing or decreasing temperature trend\n    if avg_temp == min_temp && avg_temp != max_temp  # Stable temperature trend\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif avg_temp > min_temp && avg_temp < max_temp  # Increasing temperature trend\n        trend = :increasing\n    else  # Decreasing temperature trend\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will accept a vector of temperatures and perform statistical analyses on this data using the `Statistics` package. The returned named tuple contains the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and a temperature trend, which can be either increasing, decreasing or stable. If there are no temperatures in the given list, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n\nPlease double-check that this solution meets your requirements before using it for your project.
