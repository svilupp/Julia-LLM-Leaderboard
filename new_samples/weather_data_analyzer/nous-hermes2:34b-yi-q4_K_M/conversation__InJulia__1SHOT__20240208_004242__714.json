Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if all([mean_temp < max_temp, mean_temp > min_temp])\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all([mean_temp > max_temp, mean_temp < min_temp])\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- If the input `temps` is an empty array, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n- Otherwise, it calculates the mean temperature using `mean(temps)` and finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)` respectively.\n- The trend analysis is done by comparing the mean temperature with both the maximum and minimum temperatures. If the mean temperature is greater than or equal to both the max and min, then it's classified as an increasing trend (:increasing). Similarly, if it's less than or equal to both the max and min, then it's classified as a decreasing trend (:decreasing). Otherwise, it's considered stable (:stable).\n- Finally, the function returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the calculated trend as values.\n\nYou can now use this `weather_data_analyzer` function to analyze temperature data in your Julia programs.","status":200,"tokens":[0,458],"elapsed":13.430265286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
