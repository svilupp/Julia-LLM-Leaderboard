Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create this function in Julia using the Statistics package, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary packages by adding `using Statistics; using DataFrames` at the top of your script.\n2. Define a function called `weather_data_analyzer` that takes an input list of temperatures as its argument. \n3. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` using the syntax `(; key1=nothing,key2=nothing,key3=nothing)`.\n4. Create a data frame called `df` by converting the input list of temperatures to a DataFrame object using the `DataFrame` function from the `DataFrames` package.\n5. Calculate the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature by applying the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions on the appropriate columns in the data frame. 6. Determine the trend of the temperature data. To do this, use a loop to iterate through each row of the data frame and compare it to its adjacent rows. If the difference between temperatures is consistently increasing or decreasing over time, determine the corresponding trend (either `:increasing` or `:decreasing`). If the differences are not consistently increasing or decreasing, set the trend value to `:stable`.\n7. Return a named tuple containing all of these results using the syntax `(; average=average_temperature, max=max_temperature, min=min_temperature, trend=trend)`.\n8. Test your function by calling it with an example list of temperatures and checking that the output matches what you expect.","status":200,"tokens":[0,345],"elapsed":10.091349865,"_type":"aimessage"}]
