[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution in Julia using the Statistics package for statistical analysis:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where {T<:Number}\n    if isempty(temps)  # check if list is empty\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1  # can't determine trend with only one data point\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]  \n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]  \n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable  # if neither increasing nor decreasing, it's stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using Julia's `Statistics` package functions `mean()`, `maximum()` and `minimum()`. It determines the trend by comparing the first temperature with the last one: if they are equal, it's stable; if not, and the last temperature is larger than the first one, then it's increasing; otherwise, decreasing.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that data points in the `temps` list are sorted in chronological order (from oldest to newest). If that's not the case, you would need to sort the data or adjust how you determine trends accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[10,401],"elapsed":11.72736299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
