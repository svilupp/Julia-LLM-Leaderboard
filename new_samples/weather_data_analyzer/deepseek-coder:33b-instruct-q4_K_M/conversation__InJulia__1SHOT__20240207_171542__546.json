Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the Statistics package to perform statistical analyses on your data. Below is a sample solution that should solve your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Real})\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, maximum=nothing, minimum=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) < 2  # If there's only one temperature, we can't determine a trend.\n        return (average=avg, maximum=max_temp, minimum=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n\n    slope = sum((i - 1) * (temps[i] - temps[i-1]) for i in 2:length(temps)) / (length(temps)-1)\n    \n    if slope > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif slope < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, maximum=max_temp, minimum=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function calculates the average temperature as `mean(temps)`, the max and min temperatures as `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)` respectively. It then checks if there are at least 2 data points to determine a trend (if only one point exists, we can't determine a trend). If so, it calculates the slope of a simple linear regression model between the temperature values, and assigns a symbol for whether this slope is positive, negative or zero. If the length of temps is less than 2, the trend is :stable by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":12.674498202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
