Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write the code for this task in Julia using the Statistics package. The function `trend` is a helper function that determines whether the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction trend(temps::Array{Float64})\n    if length(temps) <= 1\n        return :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > mean(temps[begin:end-1]) # the last temperature is higher than average of previous temperatures\n        return :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < mean(temps[begin:end-1]) # the last temperature is lower than average of previous temperatures\n        return :decreasing\n    else\n        return :stable\n    end\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{Float64})\n     if isempty(temps)\n         return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:stable) # all values set to nothing and the trend is stable.\n     else\n         return (average=mean(temps), max=maximum(temps), min=minimum(temps), trend=trend(temps))\n     end\nend\n```\n\nThen you can call the function with your data like this: \n```julia\nweather_data = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(weather_data)\nprintln(\"Average temperature is $(result.average), max temperature is $(result.max), min temperature is $(result.min), and the trend is $(string(result.trend))\")\n```\nThis will print out the average, maximum, minimum temperatures and trend. If the data list was empty it would return `nothing` for all values and `:stable` for the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":12.512241397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
