Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define your function using Julia's `Statistics` package for statistical analysis and Base's `NamedTuple()` constructor for creating named tuples:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` is empty. If it's not, it calculates the average using `mean()`, maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions from the `Statistics` package, and the trend based on whether the last temperature is greater than or less than the first one (assuming that `temps` is ordered in chronological order).\n\nIf the input list was empty, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. \n\nPlease note: this function assumes that the temperatures are given as an array of numbers and ordered in chronological order. If you provide a different data type or ordering, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":10.795251311,"_type":"aimessage"}]
