Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, maximum = nothing, minimum = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif all(i < j for (i, j) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end]))\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(i > j for (i, j) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end]))\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, maximum=max_temp, minimum=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's not, it calculates mean, max and min temperatures using functions from `Statistics` package.

Finally, it returns a named tuple with all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":9.323770233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
