Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use Julia's Statistics package and the `extrema` function to calculate the maximum and minimum of a collection. You can also use a simple if-else statement to determine whether the temperatures are increasing, decreasing or stable. Here is one way you could implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp, min_temp = extrema(temps)\n        \n        if all(i < j for (i,j) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end]))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(i > j for (i,j) in zip(temps[1:end-1], temps[2:end]))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures using Julia's built-in functions for mean and extrema respectively. Then, it checks whether the temperatures are increasing or decreasing by comparing each pair of consecutive days. \n\nThe `trend` field will be set to `:increasing` if the temperatures are always increasing, to `:decreasing` if they are always decreasing, and to `:stable` otherwise. The trend is determined using a combination of zip and all functions for comparing elements in adjacent pairs. \n\nRemember to add the `Statistics` package to your environment before you use it in Julia (you can add it with `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,470],"elapsed":13.395262317,"_type":"aimessage"}]
