[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem can be solved using Julia's built-in statistics functions and control structures to check for trends in temperature data. \n\nHere is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) == 1 || temps[end] == temps[end-1]\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[begin]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average = avg, max = maximum, min = minimum, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0]\nweather_data_analyzer(temps)\n# Output: (average = 20.0, max = 30.0, min = 10.0, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `mean` function from the Statistics package may not work as expected for empty vectors because it throws an error. The `isempty` check at the beginning of the function handles this case explicitly and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if the input vector is empty. \n\nAlso, note that trend analysis assumes the temperature remains stable if the current day's temperature is same as previous day's or if only one data point is given. It is not considering multiple days for trend detection. If you want to perform trend analysis over a time span more than just the last two entries in your data, it would require a different strategy.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":13.100167205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
