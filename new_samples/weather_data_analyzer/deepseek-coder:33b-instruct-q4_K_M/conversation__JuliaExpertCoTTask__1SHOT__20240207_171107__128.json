Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Include the Statistics package\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps) # Check if array is empty\n        return (average=nothing, maximum=nothing, minimum=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)  # Calculate the average of the temperatures\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the minimum temperature\n    \n    if length(temps) == 1  # If only one data point, trend is undefined\n        trend = :stable  \n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]  # Check for increasing trend\n        trend = :increasing \n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]  # Check for decreasing trend\n        trend = :decreasing \n    else  # If first and last temperatures are the same, it's stable\n        trend = :stable  \n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, maximum=max_temp, minimum=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can call the function with your given data:\n\n```julia\ndata = [25, 27, 23, 20, 22]\nprint(weather_data_analyzer(data))\n```\n\nPlease note that this function only works for arrays of real numbers and does not check if the input is valid.
