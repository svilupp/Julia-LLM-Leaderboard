Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement that in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculating the trend\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        diffs = temps[2:end] - temps[1:(end-1)]\n        num_increasing = count(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        num_decreasing = count(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = if num_increasing > num_decreasing :increasing\n            elseif num_increasing < num_decreasing :decreasing\n            else :stable end\n    else  # If there is only one temperature data point\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows: it first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If yes, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. Then it calculates the average temperature (mean), maximum temperature and minimum temperature (maximum and minimum). The trend is determined by looking at the differences between consecutive temperature measurements. If more than half the differences are positive, we say that the weather is increasing; if more than half are negative, we say that it's decreasing. Otherwise, we say that the trend is stable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":11.224036987,"_type":"aimessage"}]
