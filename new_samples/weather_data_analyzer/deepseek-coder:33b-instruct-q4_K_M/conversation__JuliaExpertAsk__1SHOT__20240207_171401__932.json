Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you could implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxtemp = maximum(temps)\n    mintemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        return (average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n    \n    # If the temperature is increasing at each point in time.\n    increasing = all(i < j for (i,j) in zip(temps[1:(end-1)], temps[2:end]))\n    if increasing \n        return (average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=:increasing)\n    end\n    \n    # If the temperature is decreasing at each point in time.\n    decreasing = all(i > j for (i,j) in zip(temps[1:(end-1)], temps[2:end]))\n    if decreasing \n        return (average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=:decreasing)\n    end\n    \n    # Otherwise the temperature is neither increasing nor decreasing.\n    return (average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=:stable)\nend\n```\nThis function calculates the average temperature by using the `mean` function from the Statistics package. The `maximum` and `minimum` functions are also used to find the highest and lowest temperatures respectively. \n\nThe `trend` is determined by checking whether the list is increasing or decreasing at each point in time, returning the appropriate symbol for each case. If the temperature does not change, then the trend will be `:stable`. If there's only one data point, then we return that as both min and max temperature with a trend of `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":14.068475435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
