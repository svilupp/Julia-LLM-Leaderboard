Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a way you can write this in Julia using the Statistics package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, maximum = nothing, minimum = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    trend = if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average = avg_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the `temps` vector is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average (mean), maximum and minimum temperatures using functions from the Statistics package. It also determines the trend of the temperature data by comparing the first element of the vector to the last one. If the first element is less than the last, the function assumes an increasing trend; if the first element is greater, it assumes a decreasing trend; if they are equal, it assumes stability. The function then returns a named tuple containing these calculated values and trends.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":9.608405542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
