Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if length(temps) == 0 \n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2 \n        return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n    \n    diffs = [temps[i+1] - temps[i] for i in 1:(length(temps)-1)]\n    if all(x -> x > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(x -> x < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty. If it's not empty, it calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature. Then, if there are at least two temperatures in the list, it calculates a `trend` based on how the temperatures change between consecutive days. The `:stable` trend means that all changes between consecutive days are either positive or negative, but not both, which is when we can't say whether the temperature is increasing or decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":11.087899252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
