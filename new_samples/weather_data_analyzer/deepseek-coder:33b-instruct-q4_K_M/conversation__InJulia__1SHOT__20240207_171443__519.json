Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

If the input list is empty, all values in the named tuple are set to `nothing`.\n\nThe trend is determined by comparing the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all these differences are positive, it means that temperatures are increasing; if they're all negative, it means that temperatures are decreasing; otherwise, the trend is considered unstable.","status":200,"tokens":[162,350],"elapsed":10.126891174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
