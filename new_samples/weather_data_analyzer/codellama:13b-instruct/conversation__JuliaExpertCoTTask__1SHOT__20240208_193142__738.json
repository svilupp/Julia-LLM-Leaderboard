Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using the `Statistics` package:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Float64, Float64, Float64, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nLet's go through the solution step by step:\n\n1. We first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. This ensures that our function can handle empty lists gracefully and doesn't throw an error.\n2. Next, we calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. We then find the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions.\n4. Finally, we determine the trend by comparing the last element in the list to the first element. If the last element is greater than the first element, the trend is `:increasing`. If the last element is less than the first element, the trend is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n5. We return a named tuple with all of these values. The `NamedTuple` type allows us to give each value a descriptive name, making our code more readable and easier to understand.\n\nNote that we use the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax to construct the named tuple. This is a compact way of creating a named tuple with multiple values without having to type out all of the keys and values separately.","status":200,"tokens":[298,505],"elapsed":12.41968298,"_type":"aimessage"}]
