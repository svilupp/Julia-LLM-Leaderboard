Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = describe(stats, temps)\n    avg = stats.mean\n    max = stats.max\n    min = stats.min\n    trend = ifelse(avg > avg[1], :increasing, ifelse(avg < avg[1], :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `describe` function from the `Statistics` package to compute summary statistics for the temperature data. It then computes the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and a trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) based on the comparison of the current average with the previous day's average. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these results.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `temps` vector is non-empty, and will return `nothing` if the list is empty. This behavior can be modified as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[201,279],"elapsed":6.863914169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
