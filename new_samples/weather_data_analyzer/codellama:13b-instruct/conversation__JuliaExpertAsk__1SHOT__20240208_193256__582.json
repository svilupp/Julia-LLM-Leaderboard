Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Float64}, Union{Nothing, Symbol}}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(mean(diff(temps)) > 0, :increasing, :decreasing)\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures. The function also checks if the list of temperatures is empty, in which case it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Finally, it uses an `ifelse` statement to determine the trend of the temperature data based on the difference between consecutive temperatures.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input array contains only numbers (i.e., no missing or NaN values). If there are any missing values in the input array, you may need to handle them appropriately before performing the statistical analysis.","status":200,"tokens":[201,340],"elapsed":8.279763191,"_type":"aimessage"}]
