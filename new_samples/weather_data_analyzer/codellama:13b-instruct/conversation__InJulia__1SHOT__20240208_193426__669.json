It first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in that case. Otherwise, it computes the mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and determines the trend of the data using the `all` function. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing these results.\n\nNote that the trend is determined by comparing the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all differences are positive, then the trend is considered `:increasing`. Similarly, if all differences are negative, then the trend is considered `:decreasing`. Otherwise, the trend is considered `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[163,360],"elapsed":8.715300332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
