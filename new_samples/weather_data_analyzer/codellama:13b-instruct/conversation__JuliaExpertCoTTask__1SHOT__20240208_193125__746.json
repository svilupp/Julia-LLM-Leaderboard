Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one possible solution:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})::NamedTuple{(:average, :max, :min, :trend), Tuple{Float64, Float64, Float64, Symbol}}\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(is_increasing_trend(temps), :increasing, :decreasing)\n\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n\nfunction is_increasing_trend(temps::Vector{Float64})::Bool\n    # check if the temperature values are increasing over time\n    for i in 1:(length(temps)-1)\n        if temps[i] >= temps[i+1]\n            return false\n        end\n    end\n    return true\nend\n```\nThis solution defines a `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes a vector of temperature data as input and returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum, and trend values. If the input list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nThe `is_increasing_trend` function checks if the temperature values are increasing over time by comparing the temperatures at each index of the vector with the previous index. If there is no decrease in temperature at any point, the trend is considered as increasing. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the trend is increasing or not.\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is. Otherwise, it computes the average, maximum, minimum, and trend values using the `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`, and `is_increasing_trend` functions respectively. Finally, it returns a named tuple with these values.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the temperature data is provided in degrees Celsius (Â°C). If the data is provided in another unit, you may need to adjust the calculations accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[298,522],"elapsed":12.772593505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
