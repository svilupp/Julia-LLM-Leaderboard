Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the functions provided by the `Statistics` package such as `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum` to calculate the average, max and min temperatures. To determine the trend, you can compare the length of unique temperature values before and after removing the minimum and maximum temperatures. If the length decreases by 1, it indicates a decreasing trend, if it increases by 1, it indicates an increasing trend.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(unique(temps)) == length(temps)-1\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif length(unique(temps)) == length(temps)+1\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average = avg_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it's an empty list, all values in the returned named tuple are set to `nothing`. \n\nIf the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures. Then it determines the trend based on the number of unique temperature values before and after removing the min and max values. The function then returns a named tuple with these four values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":9.728803497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
