Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) > 1\n        # calculate the linear regression to determine the trend\n        x = 1:length(temps)\n        y = temps\n        A = [x ones(length(x))] \\ y\n        \n        if A[2] > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif A[2] < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function using the given data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will return a named tuple with the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and trend of the temperature changes.
