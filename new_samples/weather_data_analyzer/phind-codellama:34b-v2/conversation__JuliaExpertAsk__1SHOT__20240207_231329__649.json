Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation of the required function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) <= 1 # To prevent divide by zero error\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package to calculate the average, maximum and minimum temperature respectively.
