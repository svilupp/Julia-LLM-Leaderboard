Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. You will need the `Statistics` package to use the functions `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`. \n\nFirst, load the `Statistics` package if it's not already loaded:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nThen, you can implement your function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxtemp = maximum(temps)\n    mintemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) <= 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[end-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[end-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean (average), maximum, and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions respectively. \n\nTo determine the trend, it checks whether the list has more than one element because the trend can only be determined if there are at least two data points. If there is only one element or the last temperature is equal to the second-to-last, then the trend is stable. Otherwise, it's increasing or decreasing depending on whether the last temperature is greater or smaller than the second-to-last.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with all calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,443],"elapsed":11.245612063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
