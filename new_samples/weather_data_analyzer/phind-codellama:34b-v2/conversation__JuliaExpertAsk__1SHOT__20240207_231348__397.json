It also calculates the minimum and maximum temperatures using the `minimum()` and `maximum()` functions from the `Statistics` package. The trend is determined by checking if all temperatures are the same (then it's `:stable`), or if the first temperature is less than the last one (then it's `:increasing`), or vice versa for `:decreasing`. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":8.54658691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
