Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia using the `Statistics` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) < 2  # Not enough data to determine trend\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, all values in the returned named tuple are set to `nothing`. \n\nThen, it calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package respectively.\n\nNext, it determines the trend of the temperatures. If there's not enough data to determine the trend (i.e., if there are less than 2 data points), the trend is set to `:stable`. Otherwise, it checks whether the latest temperature is greater or less than the first one. If the latest is greater, the trend is `:increasing`, and if it's less, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the latest temperature is equal to the first one, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing these four values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":11.22527253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
