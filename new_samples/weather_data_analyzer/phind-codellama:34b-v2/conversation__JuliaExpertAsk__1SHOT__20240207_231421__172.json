Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your problem using Julia language:\n\nFirstly, we need to install the Statistics package if it hasn't been installed yet. You can do this by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` into the REPL. Then you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = :stable  # default to stable if the list only has one entry\n\n        if length(temps) > 1\n            trend_slope = (temps[end] - temps[1]) / (length(temps) - 1)\n            if trend_slope > 0\n                trend = :increasing\n            elseif trend_slope < 0\n                trend = :decreasing\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function computes the mean, maximum, minimum temperature and checks the trend of the temperature data. If there is a positive slope between the first and last elements, it concludes the trend as increasing, if there is a negative slope, then it concludes it as decreasing. If there is no slope (the list contains only one entry or all entries are the same), it sets the trend to stable.\n\nNote that this function doesn't perform sophisticated statistical tests for trends, it just checks if the temperatures are generally increasing or decreasing. For instance, it would mark `[1, 3, 5, 7]` as `:increasing` even though temperature on day 2 was actually lower than on day 1.","status":200,"tokens":[0,455],"elapsed":11.554133271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
