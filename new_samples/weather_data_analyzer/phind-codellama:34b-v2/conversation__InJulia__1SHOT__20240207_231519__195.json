Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement the function using the built-in `Statistics` package and some additional logic to determine temperature trend:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate basic statistics for the given temperature data\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend based on whether the average of the differences is positive, negative or zero\n    if length(temps) < 2\n        trend = :stable  # Not enough data to determine trend\n    else\n        differences = [temps[i+1] - temps[i] for i in 1:length(temps)-1]\n        avg_diff = mean(differences)\n        if avg_diff > 0\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif avg_diff < 0\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Construct and return the result named tuple\n    (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, all fields in the output named tuple are set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the basic statistical measures and temperature trend based on the differences between consecutive temperatures in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,376],"elapsed":9.544297336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
