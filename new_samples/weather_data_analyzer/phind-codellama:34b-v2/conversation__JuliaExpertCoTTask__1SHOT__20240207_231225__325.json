Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could approach solving this problem:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n1. Load the `Statistics` package if not already loaded in your current session.\n2. Define a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of temperatures as its argument.\n3. Inside the function, check if the list is empty. If it is, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. Otherwise, calculate the average, maximum, minimum and detect the trend in temperature using functions from the `Statistics` package.\n5. Return these results in a named tuple.\n\nHere's what this might look like in code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum = maximum(temps)\n    minimum = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Detect trend\n    if length(temps) < 2  # If there's only one data point, the trend is stable\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        slopes = diff(temps) ./ diff(1:length(temps))\n        if all(slope -> slope > 0, slopes)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(slope -> slope < 0, slopes)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum, min=minimum, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with the example data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis will return a named tuple with the statistics of the provided temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,465],"elapsed":11.884211199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
