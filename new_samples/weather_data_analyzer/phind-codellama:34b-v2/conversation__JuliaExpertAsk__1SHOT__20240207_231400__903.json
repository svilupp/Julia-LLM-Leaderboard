This solution uses the built-in `Statistics` package which provides various functions to calculate statistical measures. To determine the trend of temperatures, it compares the average temperature with the maximum and minimum values.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n        minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg == maximum_temp && avg == minimum_temp\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif avg < maximum_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n\n        return (; average = avg, max = maximum_temp, min = minimum_temp, trend = trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of daily temperature data as input and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures and the trend. If the list is empty, all values in the returned named tuple are set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":7.262870937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
