Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Julia function that uses the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, max, and min temperatures, and determine the trend:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; :average => nothing, :max => nothing, :min => nothing, :trend => nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(unique(temps)) == 1\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif temps[end] > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n\n        return (; :average => average, :max => max_temp, :min => min_temp, :trend => trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if `temps` is empty. If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf `temps` is not empty, the function calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable). The trend is determined by checking if all temperatures are the same (stable), or if the last temperature is greater than the first one (increasing) otherwise it's decreasing.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with these values.","status":200,"tokens":[187,343],"elapsed":8.895541807,"_type":"aimessage"}]
