Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the function in Julia. First, we need to import the `Statistics` package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n```\n\nNow, let's define the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; :average => nothing, :max => nothing, :min => nothing, :trend => nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = temps[2:end] .> temps[1:end-1] ? :increasing : temps[2:end] .< temps[1:end-1] ? :decreasing : :stable\n    \n    return (; :average => average, :max => max_temp, :min => min_temp, :trend => trend)\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the `temps` array is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If `temps` isn't empty, the function calculates average, maximum, minimum temperatures and trends (comparing each temperature with its previous one). Then the function constructs and returns a named tuple with these calculated values.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the trend is either `:increasing`, `:decreasing` or `:stable`. If the temperature stays the same for multiple days, it will be considered as `:stable`. If you want to consider such situation as `:increasing` or `:decreasing` depending on the next change, the function needs to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":9.850496136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
