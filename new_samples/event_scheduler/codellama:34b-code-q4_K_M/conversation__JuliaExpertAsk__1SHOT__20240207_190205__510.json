Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"For example:\n```julia-repl\njulia> event_scheduler(events)\n\"No conflicts\"\n```\n\n# Solution\n\nHere we use `sort!` to sort the events by the start time, and then we check if there is any overlap between two consecutive events. If so, return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, return \"No Conflicts\". \n\nNote that here we consider that two events overlap if they intersect, that is, one starts before another ends and finishes after it starts. This may not be the right way to do it in real life. For example, a party from 8:00 to 12:00 should not overlap with a meeting from 9:00 to 10:00, but our function will say they do.","status":200,"tokens":[0,179],"elapsed":4.860486096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
