If it is, it returns `\"No events\"`. It then converts each event into a start and an end time using the Date and DateTime types. It sorts these timestamps by their start times, and for each event, it checks if the current event's end time occurs after the next event's start time. If any such pair of events is found, it returns `\"Conflict\"`. If no conflicts are found in this way, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":12.330582264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
