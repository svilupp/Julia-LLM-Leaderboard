Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following solution uses `Dates` package to parse date-time objects from strings and then compares them. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse date-time strings into DateTime objects\n    parsed = [ (DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events ]\n    \n    # Sort by start time\n    sort_by_start = sort(parsed; by=first)\n    \n    for i = 2:length(sort_by_start)\n        prev_event = sort_by_start[i-1]\n        curr_event = sort_by_start[i]\n        \n        # If current event starts before the previous one ends, there's a conflict\n        if curr_event[1] < prev_event[2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if events list is empty. If it isn't, it converts each event start-finish time pair into a tuple of `DateTime` objects and sorts the events by their starting times. Then it iterates over the sorted events and checks if any event starts before the previous one ends. If such an event exists, it means there is a conflict. If not, then all events are non-overlapping and the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[152,346],"elapsed":10.010600629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
