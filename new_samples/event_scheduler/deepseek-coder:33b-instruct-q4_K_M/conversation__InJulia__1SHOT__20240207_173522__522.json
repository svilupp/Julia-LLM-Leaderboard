Then it converts each event tuple into a tuple of `DateTime` objects and stores these in parsed_events. It then checks for overlaps by iterating over all pairs of events, checking if either start time lies within the other event's interval or vice versa. If any overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned immediately. If no conflicts are detected after checking all pairs, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,428],"elapsed":12.149370331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
