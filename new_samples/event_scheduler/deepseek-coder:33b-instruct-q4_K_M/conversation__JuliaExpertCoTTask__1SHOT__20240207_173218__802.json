Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you might write this function in Julia using Dates.jl:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    formatted_events = [DateTime.(event, dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\") for event in events]\n    \n    sort_by_starttime = sort(formatted_events; by=first)\n    current_end = first(sort_by_starttime)[1]\n    \n    for (start, stop) in sort_by_starttime\n        if start < current_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        else \n            current_end = stop\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe function works by first checking if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns `\"No events\"`. Then it formats each event's start and stop times into DateTime objects using the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. After that, it sorts these events by their start time. Then, for each event, if its start time is before the current end time (i.e., there's an overlap), it returns `\"Conflict\"`. If not, it updates the current end time to be the stop time of this event and continues to the next one. \n\nIf no conflicts are found after going through all events, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.738644951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
