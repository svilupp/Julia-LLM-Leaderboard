Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

This program will take a list of tuples representing events and return whether there are any conflicts or not:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=e->DateTime(e[1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"))\n\n    # Check for any overlapping events\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\") < DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If we've made it this far, there are no conflicts\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with your data like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis should print out `\"No conflicts\"`. If there were overlapping events, it would instead print `\"Conflict\"`. And if the list was empty, it would print `\"No events\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":11.764549506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
