Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

First, I'll parse each event time into `DateTime` objects. Then, I'll iterate through all pairs of events and check if their start or end times overlap. If any overlaps are found, the function will return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it will return \"No conflicts\". \n\nHere is a Julia code that implements this approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events), j in (i+1):length(events)\n        start_time_i, end_time_i = DateTime.(events[i])\n        start_time_j, end_time_j = DateTime.(events[j])\n        \n        if !(start_time_i >= end_time_j || start_time_j >= end_time_i)  # there is an overlap\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the provided data like this:\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis will output `\"No conflicts\"`, because the two events do not overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":11.270067939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
