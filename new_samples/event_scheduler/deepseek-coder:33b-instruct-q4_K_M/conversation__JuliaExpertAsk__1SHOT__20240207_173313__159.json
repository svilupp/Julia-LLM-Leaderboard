Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events; by=e -> (DateTime(split(e[1], ' ')[1]), DateTime(split(e[2], ' ')[1])))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_start, current_end = split(sorted_events[i][1], ' ')\n        previous_start, previous_end = split(sorted_events[i-1][2], ' ')\n\n        if DateTime(current_start) < DateTime(previous_end)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list of events is empty. If it's not, we sort the list of events by start time (first part of tuple). Then for each event, we compare its start time with the previous event's end time and return \"Conflict\" as soon as a conflict is found. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":8.472242266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
