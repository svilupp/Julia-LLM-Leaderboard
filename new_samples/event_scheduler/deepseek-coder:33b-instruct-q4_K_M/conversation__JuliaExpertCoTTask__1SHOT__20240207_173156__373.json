Then we will implement a loop that checks for overlap between every pair of events in the list. If any pair overlaps, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we return \"No conflicts\" after checking all pairs. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1, j in (i+1):length(events)\n        start_time1 = DateTime(events[i][1], \"y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time1 = DateTime(events[i][2], \"y-m-d H:M\")\n        \n        start_time2 = DateTime(events[j][1], \"y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time2 = DateTime(events[j][2], \"y-m-d H:M\")\n        \n        if !(start_time1 >= finish_time2 || start_time2 >= finish_time1)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nWe can now test the function with your data.\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\nThe output should be \"No conflicts\" as the events do not overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[0,421],"elapsed":12.088271159,"_type":"aimessage"}]
