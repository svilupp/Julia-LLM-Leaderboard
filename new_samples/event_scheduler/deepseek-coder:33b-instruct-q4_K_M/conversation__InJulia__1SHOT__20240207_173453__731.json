The function `event_scheduler` takes as input a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings representing start and end times in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format respectively.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # convert each date/time string into DateTime type\n    datetime_events = [ (DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events ]\n\n    # sort the list of tuples by start time \n    sorted_events = sort(datetime_events; lt=<=)\n    \n    # iterate through the list and check if there are any overlaps\n    for i = 2:length(sorted_events)\n        # check if this event starts before the previous one ends\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2] \n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function sorts events by their start times and then iterates through the list of events to find any overlaps. If it finds an event that starts before another one ends, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if it doesn't find any overlap it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events in the input list, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.771318601,"_type":"aimessage"}]
