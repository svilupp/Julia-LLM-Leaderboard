Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

This function uses the `Dates` package to parse the date-time strings into Date and Time objects. It then checks each pair of events to see if they overlap in time, returning \"Conflict\" as soon as it finds an overlap, or \"No conflicts\" if no overlaps are found after checking all pairs. If the list is empty, it simply returns \"No events\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    n = length(events)\n    \n    if n == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:n-1, j in (i+1):n\n        start_time_i = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_time_i = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        start_time_j = DateTime(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish_time_j = DateTime(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        if !((start_time_i > finish_time_j) || (finish_time_i < start_time_j))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list of events is correctly formatted and that each event's finish time is later than its start time. If this is not true, it may be necessary to add additional error checking code to handle these cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,395],"elapsed":11.193542835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
