[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, we return `\"No events\"` immediately. Otherwise, we sort the events by their start times in ascending order and initialize a variable to hold the end time of the current event (the one with the earliest start time). We then iterate over all other events. For each event, we check if its start time is before the current end time - if it is, this means there's an overlap between the two events, so we return `\"Conflict\"`. If no overlap is found for any of the events, we simply update the current end time and continue to the next event. Finally, if all events have been checked without finding a conflict, we return `\"No conflicts\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.630595498,"_type":"aimessage"}]
