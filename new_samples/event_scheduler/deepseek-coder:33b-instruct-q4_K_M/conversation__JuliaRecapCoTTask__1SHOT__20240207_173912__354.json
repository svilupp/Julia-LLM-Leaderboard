X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Note that I've assumed that the input list of tuples contains strings in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format and you need to use Dates package for parsing these timestamps.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    times = map(x -> (DateTime(x[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(x[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")), events)\n    \n    sort_times = sort(times, by=first)\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(sort_times)-1)\n        if sort_times[i][2] > sort_times[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first parse each date and time string into DateTime objects. We then sort these dates by their start times. If any pair of consecutive events overlap in terms of their timestamps, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no overlaps are found after checking all pairs, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":8.746365271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
