If there aren't, it returns \"No events\". Then it compares each event with every other event to see if they overlap. If an overlapping event pair is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all possible pairs of events, then it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[298,356],"elapsed":10.491442435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
