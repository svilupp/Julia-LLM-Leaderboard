X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Here's a solution where we sort all the event times and then check each pair of consecutive events if they overlap. If there is an overlap between two events, return \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if the list is empty \n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Create an array of tuples (time, type) for all start and end points\n    times = []\n    for event in events\n        start_time, end_time = Dates.DateTime.(event[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), \n                               Dates.DateTime.(event[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        push(times, (start_time, 'S')) # S means Start of event\n        push(times, (end_time,   'E')) # E means End of event\n    end\n    \n    # Sort the times array based on time and type. \n    sort(times) do a,b\n        if a[1] == b[1]\n            return a[2] < b[2]\n        else\n            return a[1] < b[1]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Check for any overlaps between events \n    count = 0\n    for time in times\n        if time[2] == 'S'\n            count += 1\n        elseif time[2] == 'E'\n            count -= 1\n        end\n        if count > 1\n            return \"Conflict\" # If there is an overlap, return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # If no overlaps were found, return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe `sort` function in Julia sorts the array based on multiple keys by using a custom comparison function. The comparison function first compares times, and if they are equal, it checks which event started first (S means Start of event came before E). If no overlaps were found after checking all events, return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,518],"elapsed":15.004111264,"_type":"aimessage"}]
