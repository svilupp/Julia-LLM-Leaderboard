The `overlap` function checks if two events overlap by comparing their start and finish times. If there is an overlap, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 09:00\", \"2023-01-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 11:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[132,411],"elapsed":9.86785136,"_type":"aimessage"}]
