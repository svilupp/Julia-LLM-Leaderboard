[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We first check if the list of events is empty, and if so, we return \"No events\".\n\nOtherwise, we iterate over each event in the list and compare it to every other event in the list. For each pair of events, we extract their start and finish times using `Date` from the Dates package, which allows us to parse the date strings into a DateTime object. We then check if the start time of the first event is before the finish time of the second event, and if the start time of the second event is before the finish time of the first event. If any pair of events overlaps in time, we return \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[432,406],"elapsed":10.310054777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
