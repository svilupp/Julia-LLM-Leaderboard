Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code that follows the problem-solving steps outlined above:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in eachindex(events)\n        start = parse(DateTime, events[i][1])\n        finish = parse(DateTime, events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in eachindex(events)\n            if i != j && (start < events[j][2] && finish > events[j][1])\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We start by checking if the `events` list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n2. Otherwise, we iterate through each event in the list using `eachindex`. For each event, we parse its start and finish times using `parse(DateTime, ...)` from the Dates package.\n3. We then iterate through all other events in the list (except for the current event) to check if there are any conflicts. If there is a conflict, we return \"Conflict\".\n4. If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\" at the end of the function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the `events` list contains only tuples with two elements (the start and finish times) in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[318,361],"elapsed":8.957059809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
