If it is, then it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it iterates over each event in the list and parses the start and finish times using `Date` from the Dates package. It then checks if the start time of one event is before or equal to the end time of another event, indicating a conflict. If there are any conflicts, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[318,242],"elapsed":6.115770882,"_type":"aimessage"}]
