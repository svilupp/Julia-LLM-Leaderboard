X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n* `Date` and `DateTime` types from the `Dates` package to parse and manipulate dates and times.\n* Functions such as `parse_date`, `parse_time`, and `now` to convert between different date and time formats.\n* The `@timeit` macro to benchmark code execution time.\n1. Solve the Task:\n* Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events (tuples with start and finish times) as input.\n* Iterate through each event in the list, convert the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects using the `parse_date` function from the `Dates` package.\n* For each event, check if there are any overlapping events by comparing their start and finish times with the `now` function from the `Dates` package. If there is a conflict, return \"Conflict\".\n* If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, return \"No events\".\n1. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n* Test the function with various inputs to ensure it returns the expected output.\n* Use the `@timeit` macro to benchmark the code execution time and optimize any performance bottlenecks.","status":200,"tokens":[435,301],"elapsed":7.705916386,"_type":"aimessage"}]
