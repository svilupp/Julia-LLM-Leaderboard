It then checks if any of the events overlap in time using the `isoverlapping` function. If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there is any conflict, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the start and finish times are represented as strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If your data has a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[132,511],"elapsed":12.246243052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
