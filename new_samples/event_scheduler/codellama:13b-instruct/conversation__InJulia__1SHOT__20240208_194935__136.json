The `isoverlapping` function checks if the two events overlap in time by comparing their finish times. If they do not overlap, the function returns false.\n\nYou can test the `event_scheduler` function like this:\n```julia\njulia> event_list = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 11:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\")]\njulia> event_scheduler(event_list)\n\"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[132,409],"elapsed":9.831875477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
