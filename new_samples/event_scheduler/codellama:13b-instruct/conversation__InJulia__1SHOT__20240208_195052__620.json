[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

It then checks for overlapping events by comparing the start and finish times of each pair of events. If any two events overlap in time, it returns a \"Conflict\" message. Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `events` list is already sorted in chronological order (i.e., the first event starts before the second event starts, and so on). If the `events` list is not sorted, you may need to sort it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[132,370],"elapsed":8.896719563,"_type":"aimessage"}]
