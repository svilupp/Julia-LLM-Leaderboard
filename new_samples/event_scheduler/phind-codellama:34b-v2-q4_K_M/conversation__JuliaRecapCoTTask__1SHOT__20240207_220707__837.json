[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Define a function `event_scheduler` with input parameter as list of events (`events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}}`). \n2. If the length of the event list is 0, return \"No events\".\n3. Create two `Set` variables to store all start and end times separately. Use `Set` because it ensures unique values and allows for efficient membership checking.\n4.

It first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it creates two sets to store start and end times separately. It loops over the given events, adds each start and end time to its respective set, sorts them, and then checks for any overlapping intervals by comparing adjacent elements in sorted arrays of start and end times. If any pair of events overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,497],"elapsed":13.81004469,"_type":"aimessage"}]
