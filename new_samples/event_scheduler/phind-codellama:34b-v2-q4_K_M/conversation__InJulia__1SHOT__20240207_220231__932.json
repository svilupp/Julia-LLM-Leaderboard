First, it checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if so. Then, it converts start and end times to DateTime format and sorts them by start time. Finally, it checks for conflicts using an iterative comparison between end time of an event and start time of the next one. If any conflict is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":10.021804372,"_type":"aimessage"}]
