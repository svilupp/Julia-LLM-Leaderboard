X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

You will also need a function to check for conflicts in the schedule. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Convert string to DateTime and sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort([(DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"), DateTime(x[2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")) for x in events])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i+1][1] < sorted_events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If not, it converts and sorts the events by start time. Then, it checks for any overlapping events by comparing the start of the next event with the end of the current event. If there's an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":8.367672645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
