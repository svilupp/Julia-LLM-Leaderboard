If it is, we immediately return \"No events\". Then, for each event, convert its start and finish times into DateTime format. We then compare this event with all subsequent events. If any pair of events have overlapping time ranges, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found after checking all possible pairs, we return \"No conflicts\". \n\nFor the given data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe function will return \"No conflicts\" because the two events do not overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,510],"elapsed":14.109118648,"_type":"aimessage"}]
