Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"))\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i+1][1] <= sorted_events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn the above function, first we check whether the given list of events is empty. If it's empty, we return \"No events\". \n\nOtherwise, we sort the events based on their start times. We use the DateTime function from Dates package to parse the date and time.\n\nThen we iterate over the sorted list of events and check if the start time of the next event is less than or equal to the end time of the current event. \n\nIf there's any such pair of events, it means they overlap in time and hence there is a conflict. In this case, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,286],"elapsed":7.83060948,"_type":"aimessage"}]
