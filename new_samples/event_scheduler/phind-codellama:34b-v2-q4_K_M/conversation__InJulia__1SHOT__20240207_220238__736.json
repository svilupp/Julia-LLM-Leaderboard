[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it's not, it sorts the events by start time using the `sort` function. Then, it checks for any overlapping events by iterating over the sorted event list and comparing the start time of each subsequent event to the finish time of the current event. If any subsequent event starts before the current one ends, a conflict is detected and \"Conflict\" is returned. If no conflicts are found after checking all the events, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":7.410530872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
