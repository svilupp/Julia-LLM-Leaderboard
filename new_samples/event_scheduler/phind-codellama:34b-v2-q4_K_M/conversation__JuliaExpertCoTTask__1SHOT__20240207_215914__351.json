Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

This function will take as input a list of events (where each event is a tuple with start and end times). It will loop over all pairs of events and compare their start and end times to see if there are any conflicts. \n\nIf it finds a conflict, it will immediately return \"Conflict\". If it finishes checking all pairs of events without finding a conflict, it will return \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it will return \"No events\".\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1, j in i+1:length(events)\n        start_time_i = DateTime(events[i][1], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time_i = DateTime(events[i][2], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n        start_time_j = DateTime(events[j][1], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time_j = DateTime(events[j][2], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n        \n        if !(finish_time_i < start_time_j || finish_time_j < start_time_i)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test our function on the example data you provided:\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis will output: Conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[0,498],"elapsed":13.765779163,"_type":"aimessage"}]
