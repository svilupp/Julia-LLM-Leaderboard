Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nIf there are events, it constructs a sorted array `timestamps` which represents all start times and end times in a combined manner. This uses list comprehension to create an array where each pair consists of a start time (`DateTime(event[1])`) plus its duration converted into minutes (`Dates.Minute(event[2])`). The DateTime constructor is used for parsing the date string.\n\nThe function then iterates over this combined array of all event start times and end times, checking whether any event ends after it starts (i.e., if a later timestamp value is less than an earlier one). If so, it returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found by the time the function has checked all possible pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":8.993491975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
