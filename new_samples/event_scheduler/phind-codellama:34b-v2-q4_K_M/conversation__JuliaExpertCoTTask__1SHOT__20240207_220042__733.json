Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events) - 1\n        start_time_i = DateTime(events[i][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish_time_i = DateTime(events[i][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n\n        for j in i + 1:length(events)\n            start_time_j = DateTime(events[j][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n            finish_time_j = DateTime(events[j][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n\n            if !(finish_time_i <= start_time_j || finish_time_j <= start_time_i)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty, returning \"No events\" if it is.
