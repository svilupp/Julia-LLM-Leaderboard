[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". \nIf there are events, it sorts them by their start times. It then checks each pair of adjacent events. If the end time of the previous event is later than the start time of the current event, this indicates that the two events overlap in time and therefore there is a conflict. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of adjacent events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":8.08232737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
