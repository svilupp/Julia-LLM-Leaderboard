Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i-1][2] > sorted_events[i][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events as its argument. First, it checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" in such case. If not, it sorts the events based on their start times using the DateTime function from Dates package to parse the date and time.\n\nThen, it iterates over the sorted list of events, comparing each event's end time with the next event's start time. If any pair of consecutive events overlap in time (i.e., the end time of an event is later than the start time of the following event), the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":7.790094903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
