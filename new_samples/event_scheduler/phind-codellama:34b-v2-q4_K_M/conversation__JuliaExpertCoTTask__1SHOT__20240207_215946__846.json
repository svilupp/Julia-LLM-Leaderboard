This function uses `DateTime` from the Dates standard library to parse the date and time strings, and then compares the start and end times of each pair of events to check for overlaps.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    elseif length(events) == 1\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\n  \n    sort!(events, by = x -> DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"))\n  \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        event1 = events[i]\n        event2 = events[i+1]\n      \n        if DateTime(event1[2], dateformat\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\") > DateTime(event2[1], dateformat\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n  \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nTo test this function with the provided data, you can run:\n\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis will output \"Conflict\" since the two events overlap in time.
