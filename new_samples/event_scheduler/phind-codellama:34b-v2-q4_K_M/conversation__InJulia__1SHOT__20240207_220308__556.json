[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, the function returns \"No events\". \n\nIf there are events, the function maps over them to create a new array where each event tuple is replaced with a tuple of `DateTime` objects corresponding to the start and finish times of the event (it ignores the time part as per requirement). \n\nNext, it compares adjacent pairs of events in the `timestamps` array. If the end time of an event is later than the start time of the next event, the function returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.37878893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
