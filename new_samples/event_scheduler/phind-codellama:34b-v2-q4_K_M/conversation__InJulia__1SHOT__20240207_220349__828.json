If it is, the function returns \"No events\". \n\nIf there are events, it converts the start and finish times (which are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM') to DateTime format and stores them as a tuple in a new list `events_datetime`. The events are then sorted by start time.\n\nNext, the function checks for any overlapping events by iterating through the list of events and comparing the finish time of each event with the start time of the next event. If an overlap is found (i.e., if the finish time of an event is later than the start time of the next event), the function returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":12.170425339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
