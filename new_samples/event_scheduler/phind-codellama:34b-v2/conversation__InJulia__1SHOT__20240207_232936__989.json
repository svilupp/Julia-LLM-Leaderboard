If it's not, it converts each event's start and end times to `DateTime` format for easy comparison. It then iterates through each pair of start and end times, checking whether any pair of adjacent time periods overlaps by seeing if one starts within the other. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[126,310],"elapsed":7.979225754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
