Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by comparing the start and end times of each event. Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(events)-1\n            dt1 = DateTime(events[i][1], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n            dt2 = DateTime(events[i+1][1], dateformat\"y-m-d H:M\")\n            if isless(dt1, dt2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it iterates over each pair of adjacent events and converts their start times to `DateTime` objects from the `Dates` module. It then checks whether the first event's start time comes before the second event's start time. If so, it means there is a conflict in the schedule, and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.120255327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
