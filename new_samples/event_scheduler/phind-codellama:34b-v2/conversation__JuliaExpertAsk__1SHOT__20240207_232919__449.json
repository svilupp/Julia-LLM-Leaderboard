Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Julia implementation of your request:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\"))\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        # Check if event i finishes before the next one starts\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\") > DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty, and returns \"No events\" in such case. Then it sorts the events by start time using the Dates package to parse the date string into a DateTime object. \n\nAfter that, it iterates through the sorted event list and checks for any conflicts: if the finish time of an event is later than the start time of the next one, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict is found after checking all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":7.644391491,"_type":"aimessage"}]
