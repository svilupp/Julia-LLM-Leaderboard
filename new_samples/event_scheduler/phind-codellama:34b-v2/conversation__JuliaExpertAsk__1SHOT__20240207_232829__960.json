If it's not, it sorts the events in ascending order based on their start times. It then iterates through the sorted list, checking each pair of consecutive events to see if they conflict (i.e., if the start time of the second event is earlier than the finish time of the first). If any conflicts are found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":9.563563707,"_type":"aimessage"}]
