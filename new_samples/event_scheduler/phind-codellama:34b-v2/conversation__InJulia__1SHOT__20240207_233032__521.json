If it's not, we sort the events based on their start time using the Dates package to parse the date and time. We then iterate over the sorted list of tuples, converting each tuple into a pair of DateTime objects for easy comparison.\n\nNext, we check if there's an overlap in time between any two events by seeing if the end time of the first event is greater than the start time of the second event and also less than its end time. If so, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":10.959095872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
