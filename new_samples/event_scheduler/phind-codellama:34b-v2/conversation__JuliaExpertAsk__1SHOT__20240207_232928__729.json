If it is, we return \"No events\". Then, we convert each start and finish time into a DateTime object for comparison. We then sort the events by their start times. Finally, we iterate through the sorted list of events to check if any of them overlap by comparing the start time of the next event with the finish time of the current event. If an overlap is found, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":8.763735906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
