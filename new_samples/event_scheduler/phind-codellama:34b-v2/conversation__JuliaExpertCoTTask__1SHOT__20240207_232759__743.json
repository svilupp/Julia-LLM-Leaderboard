Use the Julia package `Dates` for parsing and comparing date and time.\n\n2. Define a function named `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as its input. Each event is a tuple with a start and finish time (both as strings).\n\n3. Check if the list of events is empty. If it is, return \"No events\".\n\n4.
