Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Start by using the Dates package in Julia to parse the date and time strings into a common format that can be easily compared.\n\n2. Define a function `is_conflict` that takes two tuples as input, where each tuple represents a start and end time of an event. This function checks if the events conflict by comparing the start and end times. \n\n3. In your main function `event_scheduler`, iterate over all pairs of events and check if any conflicts occur using the helper function `is_conflict`. If you find a conflict, return \"Conflict\". \n\n4. After checking all pairs of events, if no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\". \n\n5. If the input list is empty, handle this edge case by returning \"No events\" before the loop.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction is_conflict(event1::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}, event2::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime})\n    return (event1[1] < event2[2] && event2[1] < event1[2])\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        events[i] = (DateTime(split(events[i][1], \" \")[1]*\"T\"*split(events[i][1], \" \")[2]), DateTime(split(events[i][2], \" \")[1]*\"T\"*split(events[i][2], \" \")[2]))\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            if is_conflict(events[i], events[j])\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nYou can then use this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis implementation will return \"No conflicts\" because the events do not overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[0,576],"elapsed":14.739793536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
