Here's how I would approach it:\n\nFirst, install and import the Dates package for time parsing:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\nimport Dates\n```\n\nDefine a function to check if two events conflict (i.e., their time intervals overlap):\n```julia\nfunction is_conflict(event1, event2)\n    start1, finish1 = Dates.DateTime.(event1, Dates.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    start2, finish2 = Dates.DateTime.(event2, Dates.DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    return (start1 < finish2) && (finish1 > start2)\nend\n```\n\nNext, I would write the `event_scheduler` function following your provided step:\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        if is_conflict(events[i], events[i+1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nNow, to test the function with provided data:\n```julia\nprintln(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\nThis should print \"Conflict\" because the two events overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":10.692516702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
