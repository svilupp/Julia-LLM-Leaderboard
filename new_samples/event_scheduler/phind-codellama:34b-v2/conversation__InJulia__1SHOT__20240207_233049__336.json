Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then we define the function `event_scheduler(events)` which takes in a list of events. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it checks for any overlapping events by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next one. If any such conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":11.103582086,"_type":"aimessage"}]
