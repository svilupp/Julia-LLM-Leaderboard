Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, return \"No events\".\n- Convert the start and end times to DateTime format for comparison.\n- Loop through the list of events and compare each pair of start and end times. If there's any overlap between events (i.e., start time of an event is earlier than the end time of another event), return \"Conflict\".\n- If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere is the Julia code for the above steps:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:length(events)\n        start_time1 = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        end_time1 = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j = i+1:length(events)\n            start_time2 = DateTime(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            end_time2 = DateTime(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if (start_time1 <= end_time2 && start_time2 < end_time1) || \n               (start_time2 <= end_time1 && start_time1 < end_time2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe function `event_scheduler` compares all pairs of events and checks if any conflict exists.
