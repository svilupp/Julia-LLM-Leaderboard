[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then, it iterates over the sorted list of events, checking each event against the next one to see if they conflict (i.e., if the finish time of the current event is later than the start time of the next event). If it finds any conflicting pair of events, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it checks the last event against the first one to account for the possibility that an event wraps around and conflicts with itself. If no conflicts are found at all, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input list of events is well-formed, i.e., every event has a valid start and finish time in the proper format. It also uses the Dates package to parse these times.","status":200,"tokens":[0,430],"elapsed":11.075849235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
