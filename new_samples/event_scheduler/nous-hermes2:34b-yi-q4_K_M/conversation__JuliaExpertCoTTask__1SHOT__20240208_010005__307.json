Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Step by Step Approach\n\n1. Import the necessary packages, Dates and DataFrames.jl in this case.\n2. Define a function `event_scheduler` which takes a list of tuples as input where each tuple contains start and finish time for an event.\n3. Create a DataFrame from the given list of events.\n4. Sort the dataframe based on the start time.\n5. Iterate over each row in the sorted dataframe to check if there is any overlapping event.\n6. If no overlap found, return \"No conflicts\".\n7. If any overlap found, return \"Conflict\".\n8. In case of an empty list, return \"No events\".\n9.
