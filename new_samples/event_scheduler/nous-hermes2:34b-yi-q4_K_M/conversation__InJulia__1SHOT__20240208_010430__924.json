We will define a function called `event_scheduler(events)` that takes an array of tuples where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\nHere is the code for the function `event_scheduler` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if events == []\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i = 2:length(events)\n        if check_conflict(events[i], events[1]) || check_conflict(events[1], events[i])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction check_conflict(eventA, eventB)\n    if startswith(string(eventA[2]), string(eventB[1])) || !startswith(string(eventA[1]), string(eventB[2]))\n        return false\n    else\n        return true\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe `check_conflict` function checks if event A and B overlap in time. It does this by comparing the start and finish times of both events. If either of these conditions is not met, there is no conflict between the two events. The outer loop iterates through each pair of events to check for conflicts.\n\nThis solution should work as expected when given a list of event tuples in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":10.938876674,"_type":"aimessage"}]
