Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start1 = Date(events[i][1])\n            finish1 = Date(events[i][2])\n            start2 = Date(events[j][1])\n            finish2 = Date(events[j][2])\n\n            if (finish1 >= start2 && finish1 <= finish2) || (start1 <= finish2 && start1 >= start2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis solution uses the `Dates` package to convert each event's start and finish times from strings into actual dates. It then checks for scheduling conflicts by comparing all combinations of events, ensuring that neither event overlaps in time with any other. If no overlapping is found, \"No conflicts\" is returned; otherwise, \"Conflict\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[150,253],"elapsed":7.574245985,"_type":"aimessage"}]
