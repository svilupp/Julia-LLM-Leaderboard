Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". \n\nIf there are any events, the function iterates through each event and checks for overlapping times with subsequent events. If both start and finish times are '00-00-00' (indicating an invalid or unspecified date/time), the check is skipped. Otherwise, it converts the start and end dates of the current event to `DateTime` objects using Julia's `Dates` package.\n\nIt then iterates through all subsequent events, converting their start and finish times to `DateTime` objects as well. If the finish time of the previous event is before the start time of the next event or if the start time of the previous event is after the end time of the next event, it means that there's a scheduling conflict, so \"Conflict\" is returned. Otherwise, if all events have non-overlapping times, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":14.951267992,"_type":"aimessage"}]
