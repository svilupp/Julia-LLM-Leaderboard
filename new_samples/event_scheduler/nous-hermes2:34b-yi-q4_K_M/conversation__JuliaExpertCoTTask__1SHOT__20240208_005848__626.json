Define a function `parse_date` to parse the date format from 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' into a DateTime object using Dates package.\n2. Create a function `is_overlapping` that takes two DateTime objects and checks if they overlap in time.\n3. Iterate through each event in the list. For every event, create a start and end date using the `parse_date` function.\n4. Check if there are any overlapping events with the current event by checking for overlaps between its start and end dates with all other events' start and end dates using the `is_overlapping` function.\n5.
