It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it compares all pairs of events to check for any overlap in their time ranges, using `Dates` package for date parsing and comparison. If there are no overlaps found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":8.336260523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
