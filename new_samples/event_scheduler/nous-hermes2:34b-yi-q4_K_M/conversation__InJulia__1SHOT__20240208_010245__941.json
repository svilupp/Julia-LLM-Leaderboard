It sorts the events by start time, then finish time to ensure that if there are any conflicts, they will be detected correctly.\n\nThe `isconflict` function takes two tuples representing events and returns true if the events overlap in time, false otherwise. It converts the event strings to DateTimes using the `Dates.DateTime` function and checks if the start times of both events are less than or equal to the end times of the other event.","status":200,"tokens":[120,584],"elapsed":17.328427796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
