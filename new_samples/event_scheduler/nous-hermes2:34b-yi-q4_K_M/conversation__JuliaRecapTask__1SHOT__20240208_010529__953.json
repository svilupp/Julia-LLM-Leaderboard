X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function will iterate over all pairs of events to check if any overlap. If an overlap is found, return \"Conflict\"; otherwise, return \"No conflicts\". Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Import necessary packages and functions:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n2. Define the function `event_scheduler` which takes a list of events (each event is a tuple containing start and finish times), and returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" otherwise:\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    # Check for any scheduling conflicts among the events.
