Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It first checks if there are no events in the list; if so, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it iterates over the events starting from the second one and checks for any overlapping times using `intersect()` method of the Dates package. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are detected, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":6.837522858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
