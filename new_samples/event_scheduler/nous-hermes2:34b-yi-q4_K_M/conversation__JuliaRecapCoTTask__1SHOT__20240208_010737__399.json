Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- `Dates` package for date and time parsing and operations.\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort by start time (safest) or end time if there's a tie\n    sorted_events = sort(events, lt=(a, b) -> a[1] < b[1]) do e1, e2 \n        if e1[1] == e2[1] # If start times are equal, sort by end time\n            e1[2] > e2[2] || e1[1] == e2[1] && e1[2] < e2[2]\n        else\n            e1[1] < e2[1]\n        end\n    end \n\n    # Check for conflicts in the sorted list.\n    for (i, event) in enumerate(sorted_events)\n        if i > 1 # Skip first event since it can't conflict with itself\n            # Get the start and end times of the current event and compare them to the previous one.\n            cur_start = DateFormat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"(string(event[1]))\n            cur_end   = DateFormat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"(string(event[2]))\n            prev_end  = DateFormat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"(string(sorted_events[i-1][2]))\n\n            # If the start of this event is after the end of the previous one, there's no conflict.\n            if cur_start > prev_end\n                continue\n            else # Otherwise, check if the current event ends before or during the next event (if it exists)\n                next_event = i+1 < length(sorted_events) ? sorted_events[i+1] : nothing\n                next_start = DateFormat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"(string(next_event isa Nothing ? \"0000-00-00 00:00\" : next_event[1]))\n                if cur_end <= next_start\n                    return \"Conflict\" # Conflict found between current and previous events.\n                else\n                    # If this event ends after the next one, it's fine and we can move on to the next event.\n                    continue\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n- The function first checks if there are any events in the list. If not, it returns \"No events\" to indicate an empty schedule. \n- Then it sorts the events by their start times using a custom `sort` method with a callback function to handle cases where two events have equal start times (in which case, sort them by end time). This ensures that we can safely compare subsequent events without needing additional logic for handling ties.\n- After sorting, it iterates through the list of sorted events and checks for conflicts with previous or following events. If a conflict is found, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it continues to the next event in the list.\n- When no more events are left in the list (after iterating through all pairs of adjacent events), it means that there were no scheduling conflicts and thus it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,804],"elapsed":24.036248314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
