Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Import the necessary package `Dates` for parsing dates and times.\n2. Create a function `event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})` that takes in an array of tuples representing events.\n3. Initialize an empty result string `result = \"No conflicts\"`.\n4. Iterate through the list of events. For each event, create two DateTime objects for its start and end times using `Dates.DateTime()` function with help from `split()` method.\n5. Use a loop to check if any previous events have overlapping time periods with the current one. The loop should iterate over all the previous events before the current one in terms of their starting timestamps.\n6. If an overlap is detected, set the result string as \"Conflict\" and break out of the loop. Otherwise, continue checking for conflicts.\n7. After iterating through all events, return the final result string to indicate whether there were any conflicts or not.\n8. Test the function with a provided example data to ensure it works correctly.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nimport Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    result = \"No conflicts\"\n\n    for (i, event) in enumerate(events)\n        event_start = Dates.DateTime(split(event[1], \" \")[1])\n        event_end = Dates.DateTime(split(event[2], \" \")[1])\n\n        for j in 0:(i-1)\n            prev_event = events[j][1]\n            prev_start = Dates.DateTime(split(prev_event, \" \")[1])\n            prev_end = Dates.DateTime(split(events[j][2], \" \")[1])\n\n            if (Dates.hour(event_start) >= Dates.hour(prev_end)) || (Dates.hour(prev_start) >= Dates.hour(event_end))\n                result = \"Conflict\"\n                break\n            else\n                result = \"No conflicts\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n# Test\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,594],"elapsed":17.589895278,"_type":"aimessage"}]
