Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We will use the Dates package to parse the time strings into DateTime objects for comparison.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Initialize an empty set to store start times of ongoing events\n    ongoing = Set()\n\n    # Iterate through each event and check for conflicts with any ongoing events\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        if !isempty(ongoing) && is_overlapping(start, finish, ongoing)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n\n        # Add the start time of this event to the set of ongoing events\n        push!(ongoing, DateTime(start))\n\n        # After checking all current ongoing events, move on to the next one\n        next_event = pop!(ongoing)\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nis_overlapping(start::DateTime, finish::DateTime, ongoing::Set{DateTime}) = any(is_between(start, ongoing)) && is_between(finish, ongoing)\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output \"No conflicts\" since there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":12.549528155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
