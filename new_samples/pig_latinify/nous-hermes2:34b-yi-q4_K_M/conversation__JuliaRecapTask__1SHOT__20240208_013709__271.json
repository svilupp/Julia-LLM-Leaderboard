[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns another vector of strings where each string has been transformed into its corresponding pig latin form.\n\nThe main steps of the solution are:\n- Defining the `pig_latinify` function that accepts a vector of words.\n- Initializing a variable `n` to store the number of threads available using `Threads.nthreads()`.\n- Creating an empty output vector `out` with the same length as the input vector.\n- Using Julia's multithreading functionality, we iterate over each word in the input vector using the `@threads for` loop construct.\n- Inside each iteration, the current word is transformed into pig latin by finding its first uppercase letter and checking if it has any non-whitespace characters before that. If there are no non-whitespace characters, we append \"ay\" to the end of the word after removing leading whitespaces.\n- If there is at least one non-whitespace character before the first uppercase letter, we extract all such characters and concatenate them with the remaining part of the word after the first uppercase letter.\n- The transformed word is then stored in the output vector `out` for each iteration.\n- Finally, the function returns the completed `out` vector containing all transformed words.\n\nThis solution efficiently utilizes multiple threads to process the input strings concurrently and improves performance by distributing the work among available cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,599],"elapsed":17.853376614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
