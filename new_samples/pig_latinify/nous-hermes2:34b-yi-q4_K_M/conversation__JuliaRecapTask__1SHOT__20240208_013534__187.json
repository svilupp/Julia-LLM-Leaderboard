[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It checks if the length of the input is zero and returns it unchanged if so. Otherwise, it creates multiple tasks (`Threads.@threads`) for each string to be translated into pig latin using the `pig_latinify_word` function. The results are then collected and returned as a vector of strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function checks if the first character of the word is a vowel or starts with \"qu\" or \"wh\". If so, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it extracts the last character and prepends it to the rest of the word followed by \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":13.091025289,"_type":"aimessage"}]
