[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If the first letter is not a vowel, add it at the end of the word.\n2. Move all consonants after the first one to the beginning.\n3. Add 'ay' at the end of the word to indicate that it has been converted to pig latin.\n\nWe then use the `@threads` macro from Julia's `Base.Threads` module to iterate over each string in a separate thread and apply the `toPigLatin` function. This allows for parallel processing, potentially speeding up the execution of this task.\n\nFinally, we collect the results from all threads into a new vector of strings and return it as the final output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,552],"elapsed":16.392901347,"_type":"aimessage"}]
