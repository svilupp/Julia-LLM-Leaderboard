It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector)\n    result = [Threads.@spawn pig_latin(string) for string in strings]\n    return collect(result)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    if isvowel(first(word))\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return join([first(word), first(word) == 'q' ? \"u\" : \"\", last(word[2:end])..., \"ay\"], \"\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction isvowel(c::Char)\n    return c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] || c == 'y'\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses threading to process each word in the vector of strings separately. The `pig_latinify` function creates a collection of threads by passing each string through the `pig_latin` function, then collects the results from those threads and returns them as a new vector of transformed strings.\n\nThe `isvowel` function checks if a character is a vowel or 'y' (which is sometimes treated like a vowel in pig latin), while the `pig_latin` function applies the rules for transforming words into pig latin:\n- If the first letter of the word is a vowel, the word is returned as is, followed by \"way\".\n- If the first letter of the word is not a vowel, it's moved to the end and concatenated with \"ay\", preceded by any remaining letters in the word, if applicable (e.g. for words starting with 'q', we add an additional 'u').","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":11.948651455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
