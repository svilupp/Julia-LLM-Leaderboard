X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function `pig_latinify` operates on a vector of strings and returns a new vector with transformed pig latin words.\n2. It uses threads to apply transformations in parallel on each word.\n3. A check is made to see if the word starts with a vowel or has a vowel after a consonant, and then applies the appropriate transformation rule.\n4. In other cases, it moves the first consonant (or rest of string if it is a vowel) to the end and adds 'ay'.\n5. The function `pig_latinify` correctly returns an updated vector with transformed pig latin words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,694],"elapsed":20.615253779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
