[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"We will first create a `pig_latinify` function that converts the words in English to Pig Latin. Then, we can use Julia's multithreading capabilities with `Threads.@threads` to apply this function on each string of the vector concurrently.\n\nThe pig latin algorithm is as follows:\n- Take the first consonant sound from the word and move it to the end of the word. If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end of the word. \n- Put an 'h' before any leading silent 'h' in the word.\n\nFor example:\n- \"Hello\" becomes \"Ellohay\"\n- \"Apple\" becomes \"Applay\"\n\nLet's start by creating a function to convert each string into Pig Latin format:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return \"$word way\"\n    end\n\n    first_letter = first(word)\n    rest = String(word[2:end])\n    rest_vowel = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, rest)\n    rest_without_vowel = String(view(rest, start(rest):predecessor(indexin(vowels, rest))))\n    return \"$rest_without_vowelay $first_letter\"\nend\n```\n\nTo make it work with a vector of strings and use threads, we can do the following:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(pig_latinify(word))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow if you have a vector of strings `strings = [\"Hello\", \"World\"]`, then calling `pig_latinify(strings)` will print each string converted to pig latin format on separate lines. The threads handle the processing of multiple words concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":14.043413605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
