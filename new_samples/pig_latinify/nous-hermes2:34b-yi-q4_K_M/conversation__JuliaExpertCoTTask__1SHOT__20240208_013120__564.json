Think through your approach step by step\n2. Write any functions and other code you need\n3. Solve the task\n4. Check that your solution is correct\n\nStep 1 - Think through your approach step by step:\n- Define a `pig_latinify` function that takes in a vector of strings\n- Iterate over each string in the vector\n  - Define a function to convert a single word to pig latin\n  - Convert each word to pig latin using this function\n- Run each iteration on a separate thread\n\nStep 2 - Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    threads = []\n    for word in words\n        t = @async convert_to_pig_latin(word)\n        push!(threads, t)\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and collect results\n    results = [fetch(x) for x in threads]\n\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(s::AbstractString)\n    if startswith(lowercase(s), \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\") || s[1] == 'y'\n        return join([uppercase(first(s)), lowercase(join(split(s)[2:end], \"\"))], \"ay\")\n    else\n        return join([lowercase(first(s)), lowercase(join(split(s)[2:end], \"\"))], \"way\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nStep 3 - Solve the task:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified_words)\n```\n\nStep 4 - Check that your solution is correct:\n- Running the provided example should output a vector of strings in pig latin format. Each word will be converted separately and executed on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":14.458844287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
