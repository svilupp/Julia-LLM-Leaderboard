X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets for string manipulation and thread management.\n2. Create a function to translate a single word from English to Pig Latin.\n3. Iterate over each word in the input vector using multiple threads.\n4. Verify that the solution works correctly by checking if the output of `pig_latinify` is the same as expected.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Step 2: Create a function to translate a single word from English to Pig Latin\n    function translate(word::AbstractString)\n        # If the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" at the end\n        if all(x -> isequal(x[1], 'a' | 'e' | 'i' | 'o' | 'u'), eachindex(word))\n            return string(word, \"ay\")\n        else\n            # Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\"\n            return string(sub(word, 2:end) * word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate over each word in the input vector using multiple threads\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        words[i] = translate(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test our `pig_latinify` function with the following vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\nprint(\"Original words:\\n\\t\")\nfor w in words\n    println(w)\nend\n@show pig_latinify(words) == [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"thishay\", \"isahay\", \"ay\", \"testtay\"]\n```\n\nIf the output is `true`, then our function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":15.064291947,"_type":"aimessage"}]
