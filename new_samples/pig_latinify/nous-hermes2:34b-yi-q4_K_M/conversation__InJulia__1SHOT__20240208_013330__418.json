The transformation is done by the helper function `pig_latinify_word`. Each iteration runs on a separate thread using the `@spawn` macro from the Threads module.\n\nTo use this code, simply call the `pig_latinify` function with your vector of strings as an argument:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"Julia\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result) # Outputs [\"Ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"Uliaypay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,428],"elapsed":12.499251634,"_type":"aimessage"}]
