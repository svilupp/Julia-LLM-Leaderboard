It uses a helper function `to_pig_latin` to transform one word at a time:\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if first(lowercase(word)) âˆˆ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractArray)\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Array{String}(undef, n)  # Preallocate for efficiency.\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input is an array of strings, and each string contains a single word. If you need to handle sentences or longer strings, you'll have to modify `to_pig_latin` to work on these larger pieces of text. The parallel processing part (`@threads for`) ensures that it will work fast even with large amounts of data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.717169072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
