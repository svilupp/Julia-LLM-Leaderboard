X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is a simple implementation using the `Threads` package and Julia's concurrency features. Note that in practice, if your operations are CPU intensive, Julia's built-in JIT compiler can help optimize your code by precompiling functions used in threads.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = similar(words)\n    \n    # create a function that transforms one word\n    function to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) \n        if isempty(word)\n            return \"\"\n        end\n        \n        first_letter, rest = word[1], word[2:end]\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n        # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n        if first(word) in vowels \n            return string(\"$(rest)\", \"way\")\n        else\n            return string(\"$(rest)\", \"$(first_letter)\", \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Use threads to process all words concurrently\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis solution works by using Julia's `Threads` package to create a separate thread for each word. The function `to_pig_latin` is applied on all words concurrently, and the result is stored in an array `results` which is returned at the end of the function. Note that we need to use the special keyword macro `Threads.@threads` to tell Julia that the following loop should be executed concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,436],"elapsed":12.583364991,"_type":"aimessage"}]
