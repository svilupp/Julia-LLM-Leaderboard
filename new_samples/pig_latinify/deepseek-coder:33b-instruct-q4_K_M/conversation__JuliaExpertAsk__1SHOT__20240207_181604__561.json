Note that this function assumes all words are alphabetic and does not handle punctuation or special characters within words. It also doesn't handle upper case letters in the middle of words, so \"helloWorld\" would become \"elloWorldhay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":8.182126636,"_type":"aimessage"}]
