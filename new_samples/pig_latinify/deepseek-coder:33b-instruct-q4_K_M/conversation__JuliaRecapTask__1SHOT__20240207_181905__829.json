X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Below is an example of how you could implement your `pig_latinify` function. This function uses threads to apply a transformation to each element in a vector concurrently. The transformation for pig latin would be applied by calling this function on each word in the array.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    n = length(words)\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        if isempty(word)\n            result[i] = \"\"\n        elseif first(word) in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            result[i] = \"$(word)way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = \"$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `Threads.@threads` is used to parallelize the loop over the vector of words. Each thread takes turns executing the loop body on different elements in the array. \n\nThis code assumes that the input strings only contain lower-case letters and no punctuation or special characters. If it's supposed to handle more cases (e.g., upper case, punctuation), additional logic would be needed to properly process the input strings. Also note that threading can add overhead for small inputs because of synchronization, so for very large inputs this could be faster than a single-threaded version.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":10.775786442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
