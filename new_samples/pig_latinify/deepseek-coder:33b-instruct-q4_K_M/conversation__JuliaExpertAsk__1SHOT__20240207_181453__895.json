It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia using the Threads module for parallel processing:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    return map(word -> begin\n        if word[1] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            string(word, \"way\")\n        elseif length(word) > 1 && word[2] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        elseif length(word) > 2 && word[3] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            string(word[3:end], word[1:2], \"ay\")\n        else\n            string(word[4:end], word[1:3], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end, words)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_parallel(words::Vector{String})\n    results = similar(words)\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify([words[i]])[1]\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nIn this code, `pig_latinify` is a function that takes an array of words and returns the Pig Latin translation for each word. The `pig_latinify_parallel` function operates on multiple threads by using Julia's built-in parallel computing capabilities through `@threads` macro. \n\nNote: This code does not guarantee any specific order in results as it is running tasks concurrently. If you need the output to maintain original ordering, use a different method of task scheduling (like a lock) which may impact performance.","status":200,"tokens":[0,409],"elapsed":11.590254481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
