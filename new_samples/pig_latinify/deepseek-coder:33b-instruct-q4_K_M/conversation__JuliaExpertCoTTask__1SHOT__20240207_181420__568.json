Therefore, this example uses `@threads` inside a single function. \n\nAlso, please note that Julia's threading does not provide any benefits for IO-bound tasks (like waiting for data from disk) because it is inherently sequential. However, CPU-intensive computations can be sped up significantly with multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":10.010187796,"_type":"aimessage"}]
