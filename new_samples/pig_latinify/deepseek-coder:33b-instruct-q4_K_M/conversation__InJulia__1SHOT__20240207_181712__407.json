Please note that you should run this script with multiple threads (with the `-t` or `--threads` argument) for full utilization of multiple cores.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that running Julia scripts with `Distributed` is more complex and requires understanding about how Julia's multi-processing works. This program does not collect or return the results back to the main process (it just runs them on separate processes). If you want to get the results back into your main process, you would have to use inter-process communication (IPC) primitives such as `remotecall_fetch` and `fetch`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":12.68466128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
