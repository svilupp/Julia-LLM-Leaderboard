[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The code below transforms each string from the input vector into pig latin by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\". \n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        if length(word) > 0\n            first_letter, remaining_letters = word[1], word[2:end]\n            pig_latin_word = \"$remaining_letters-$first_letter\" * (lowercase(word) != word ? \"Ay\" : \"ay\")\n        else\n            pig_latin_word = word\n        end\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\nThis function operates on a vector of strings, and for each string in the input vector it takes the first letter and moves it to the end of the word. Then, if the original word was not already lowercase, appends \"Ay\". If the original word was lowercase, appends \"ay\". \n\nIt then runs this transformation on separate threads for each element in the vector using `Threads.@threads`. This can lead to significant speedup when working with large vectors of strings, especially if your system has multiple cores or processors. However, it's important to note that threading comes with its own overhead and is not always faster than single-threaded execution, particularly for small tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":11.209192731,"_type":"aimessage"}]
