The function pig_latinify_threaded takes in a vector of words and for each word it applies the pig_latinify function on a separate thread.\n\nPlease note: Julia's built-in threading model may not provide any performance benefit if you are working with very short strings because creating threads is expensive. If your strings are long enough, using multiple threads could significantly speed up the computation, especially for more complex computations or when dealing with a large number of words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":10.513923315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
