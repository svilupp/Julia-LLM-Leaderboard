The `eachindex(words)` generator creates an iterator that gives indices of the words array, which is used as the loop counter.\n\nNote: In Pig Latin, the first letter of a word is moved to the end of the word and appended with \"ay\". If the first letter is a vowel, we just append \"ay\" at the end. But if it's a consonant, we need to move all initial consecutive consonants to the end and then append \"ay\". For simplicity, this implementation only moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\", which should be good enough for English words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,428],"elapsed":12.115474058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
