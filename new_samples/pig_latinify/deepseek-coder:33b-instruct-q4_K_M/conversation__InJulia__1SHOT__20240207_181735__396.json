This function transforms an English word into Pig Latin by moving its initial consonant cluster or consecutive consonants (the \"ay\" sound) to the end of the word and adding \"ay\". If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"yay\" at the end.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Array{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        \n        # If the first letter is a vowel\n        if first(word) in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            results[i] = \"$(word)yay\"\n            \n        else\n            for j in 2:length(word)\n                # If the current letter is a vowel, split the word and add ay at end.\n                if word[j] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                    results[i] = \"$(word[j:end])$(word[1:(j-1)])ay\"\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@threads` macro from the Base.Threads module to parallelize the computation across multiple threads. For each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel and applies the appropriate transformation. If not, it iterates over the rest of the letters until it finds a vowel and splits the word at that point. The transformations are then stored in an array which is returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":11.623320034,"_type":"aimessage"}]
