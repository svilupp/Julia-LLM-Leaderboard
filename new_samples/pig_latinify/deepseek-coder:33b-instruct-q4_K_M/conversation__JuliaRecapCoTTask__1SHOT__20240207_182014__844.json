[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It creates an empty vector called `transformed` that will store the translated pig latin words. Then, it uses Threads package to parallelize the operation over each word by using `@threads for loop`. For each word, it checks if the first letter is a vowel or not and then transform the word according to pig latin rules (If the word begins with a consonant sound, move it to end of the word and append \"ay\"). If the word starts with a vowel, just add \"ay\" at the end. \n\nRemember that you need to use Julia versions higher than v1.3 for this feature to work correctly due to threading support added in version 1.3.","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":11.016609763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
