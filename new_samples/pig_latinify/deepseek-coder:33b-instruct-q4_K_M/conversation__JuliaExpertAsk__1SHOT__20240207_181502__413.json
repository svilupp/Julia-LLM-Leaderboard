Please note that Julia uses the `Threads` module for multithreading, not asynchronous programming. Also note that Julia strings are immutable, so we have to build a new string every time we change it, which can be costly in terms of memory usage.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(vec::Vector{String})\n    n = length(vec)\n    result = Array{Union{Missing, String}}(missing, n) # initialize result vector with missing values\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = vec[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        \n        if first_letter in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            result[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word[2:end] * string(first_letter) * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector where each string has been converted to Pig Latin. It uses Julia's `Threads` module for multithreading, meaning that each iteration of the loop will run on a separate thread. This can significantly speed up processing time if you have a large number of strings to convert, but it also means that the order in which the strings are processed may not be predictable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":9.224630266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
