[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If not, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\". It runs on multiple threads by using `@threads` from the Base.Threads module.\n\nThis implementation assumes that words are separated by spaces. If your input is different you might need to adjust the split function accordingly. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ninput = [\"pig latin\", \"hello world\"]\nprintln(pig_latinify(input))\n```\n\nThis will output `[\"igpay atinlay\", \"ellohay orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":9.990105186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
