It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia using the Threads module:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        if isempty(word) # If the string is empty\n            results[i] = \"\"\n        elseif first(word) in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') # If the first letter is a vowel\n            results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        else # If the first letter is a consonant\n            results[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we create an empty vector `results` of size equal to the input vector. Then we use `Threads.@threads` to iterate over each element in parallel threads. For each word, if it starts with a vowel, we just add \"ay\" at the end. If it doesn't start with a vowel, we move the first letter to the end and then add \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that Julia uses 1-based indexing, so `word[2:end]` means from the second character onwards. The function `first(word)` returns the first character of a string.","status":200,"tokens":[97,339],"elapsed":9.732793917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
