Note that this code doesn't handle edge cases such as punctuation marks or capitalization.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(vec::Vector{String})\n    n = length(vec)\n    result = similar(vec, String)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = vec[i]\n        if isempty(word)\n            result[i] = \"\"\n        else\n            first_letter = word[1]\n            rest_of_the_word = word[2:end]\n            piglatin_word = \"$rest_of_the_word-$first_letter\"\n            result[i] = piglatin_word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector where each string is transformed into Pig Latin. The transformation of each word is done in parallel using multi-threading provided by Julia's `Threads` library.\n\nThe function uses the `Base.Threads.@threads` macro to distribute the workload across multiple threads. Each thread processes a subset of the input vector independently. \n\nFor each word, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\". If the word is empty, it simply returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":9.715735699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
