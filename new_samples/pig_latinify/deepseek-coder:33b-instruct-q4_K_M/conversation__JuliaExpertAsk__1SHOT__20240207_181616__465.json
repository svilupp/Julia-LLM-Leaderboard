Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia does not support true parallel execution out-of-the-box like Python, but we can use the `Threads` module for this task. However, keep in mind that Julia's native threads are designed for CPU-intensive tasks and might not be suitable or efficient for IO-bound or blocking operations such as string transformation.\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformer using Threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    # Helper function to transform word to Pig Latin\n    if length(word) == 0 || !isalpha(first(word))\n        return word\n    end\n    \n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n\n    if first_letter âˆˆ vowels\n        word *= \"way\"\n    else\n        word = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\n    \n    return capitalize(word) # Preserve the original case\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(words)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nIn this code, we create a helper function `to_pig_latin` that transforms an individual word into pig latin. We then use Julia's `@threads for` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector, applying the transformation and storing the result back in the output array. Note that this will only work if your input data is large enough to make it worthwhile to parallelize.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":11.652082504,"_type":"aimessage"}]
