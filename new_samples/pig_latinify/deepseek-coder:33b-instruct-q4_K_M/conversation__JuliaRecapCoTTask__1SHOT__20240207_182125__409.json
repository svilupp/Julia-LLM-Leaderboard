[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

It uses Threads package for multi-threading support. The `pig_latinify` function transforms each string in a vector to Pig Latin by moving its first letter to the end and adding \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, it just adds \"yay\" at the end.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads  # Julia package for multi-threading support\n\nfunction pig_latinify(vec::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(vec))  # Create an empty vector of strings with same size as input vector.\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(vec)\n        word = vec[i]  # Get the string at index `i`.\n        if startswith(word, \"a\") || startswith(word, \"e\") || startswith(word, \"i\") || startswith(word, \"o\") || startswith(word, \"u\")\n            result[i] = word * \"yay\"  # If the word starts with a vowel, just add \"yay\".\n        else\n            result[i] = last(word) * first(word, String) * \"ay\"  # Move first letter to end and add \"ay\".\n        end\n    end\n    return result  # Return the resulting vector.\nend\n```\n\nThe `eachindex(vec)` function returns a range of indices corresponding to each position in the array (or string in this case). The `@threads for i in eachindex(vec)` part is a special construct that divides iterations among available threads. Note that threading support may not be enabled by default in Julia, you might need to start julia with `julia -t auto` or `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 julia` for this to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,433],"elapsed":12.488106897,"_type":"aimessage"}]
