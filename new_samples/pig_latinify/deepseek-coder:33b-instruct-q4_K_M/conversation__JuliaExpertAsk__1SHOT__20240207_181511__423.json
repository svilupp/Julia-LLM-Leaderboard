Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Threads.@threads` macro for parallel execution. But please note that Julia's Base library doesn't have any built-in support for creating threads in a non-global scope (i.e., inside a function). Thus, we need to make sure our code is running from the top level (or within a `Base.include` block).\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformer using threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(strings)\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(strings)\n        str = lowercase(strings[i]) # Make it case insensitive\n        \n        if first(str) âˆˆ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            result[i] = str * \"way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = str[2:end] * str[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings as input, creates an empty vector `result` with the same size, and then iterates over each string in parallel using threads. It transforms each string to pig latin by adding \"way\" at the end if it starts with a vowel or shifting the first character to the end and adding \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":9.056176294,"_type":"aimessage"}]
