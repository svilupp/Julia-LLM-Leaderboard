[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how this could be done:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    results = Vector{Task}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    for i = 1:length(strings)\n        s = strings[i]\n        \n        # Create a new task to execute the string transformation\n        results[i] = Threads.@spawn begin\n            # Check if the string is empty or doesn't start with a letter\n            if length(s) == 0 || !isletter(s[1])\n                return s \n            end\n            \n            # Check if the first character of the string is a vowel\n            if lowercase(s[1]) in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                \"$(s)way\"\n            else\n                \"$(s[2:end])$(s[1])ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Wait for all tasks to complete and collect their results\n    return fetch.(results)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the @spawn macro from the Threads module to create a new task for each string in the input vector. Each task applies the pig latin transformation to its assigned string. After creating all tasks, it waits for them to complete and collects their results into a new Vector which it then returns.\n\nPlease note that this function doesn't check if the string is valid English or contains only alphabetic characters. It assumes that each string in the input vector represents an independent word. Also, it won't handle punctuation correctly; it might convert words like \"hello!\" to \"ellohay\" instead of \"ellohay!\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,427],"elapsed":12.322962918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
