It uses the `Threads` module's `@spawn` macro to dispatch each string-transformation task on a new thread:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed = similar(words)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        transformed[i] = latinize(word)\n    end\n    \n    return transformed\nend\n\nfunction latinize(word::String)\n    if word[1] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') || word[1] in ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `Threads.@threads for` macro creates a separate thread to handle each iteration of the loop concurrently. The resulting vector `transformed` is returned once all threads have finished their tasks.\n\nNote: Julia's multithreading is not perfect and might be slower in some cases compared to single-threading due to the overhead of creating threads and managing them. \n\nIf you plan on using this code for large strings or many words, it might be worthwhile to consider using a distributed computing environment like DistributedArrays or DistributedDataFrame provided by Julia's standard libraries, especially if your task is embarrassingly parallel (i.e., each word transformation doesn't depend on others).","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":10.532364176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
