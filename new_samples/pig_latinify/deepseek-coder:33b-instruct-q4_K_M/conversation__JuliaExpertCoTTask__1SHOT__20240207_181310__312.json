In this case, we are creating a new string for each word in the input vector and storing it into an array. This means that our function is not mutating any state (we're only reading from `words`), which makes it thread-safe without any need for locks or atomics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":9.377787576,"_type":"aimessage"}]
