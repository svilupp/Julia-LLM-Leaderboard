[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We can use this macro to perform parallel processing over a vector of strings. \n\nHere's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    output = similar(input)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(input)\n        word = input[i]\n        \n        if first(word) ∈ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') || first(word) ∈ ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')\n            output[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            output[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an input vector of strings, and for each string in the input it applies the pig-latin rules. If the first character is a vowel, we simply append 'way' to the end. Otherwise, we move the first letter to the end and add 'ay'. The `Threads.@threads` macro automatically distributes the work across all available threads on the system.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":8.285596407,"_type":"aimessage"}]
