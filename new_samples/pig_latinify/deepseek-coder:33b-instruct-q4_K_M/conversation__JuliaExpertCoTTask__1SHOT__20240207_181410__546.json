I will write a function `translate` that converts one word to pig latin, and then use this function with map on the array of words which can be run on separate threads.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction translate(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = similar(words)\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        results[i] = translate(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by checking the first letter of each word. If it's a vowel, we just add \"ay\" to the end of the word. If it's not a vowel, we remove the first character and append it at the end of the rest of the word before adding \"ay\".\n\nThe function pig_latinify then iterates over each word in words and applies translate on that word using Julia's built-in multithreading. The @threads macro automatically handles distributing the loop iterations among available threads, so we don't need to manually manage threads or synchronization. It uses a shared array results to store the result of translation for each word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":10.041727734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
