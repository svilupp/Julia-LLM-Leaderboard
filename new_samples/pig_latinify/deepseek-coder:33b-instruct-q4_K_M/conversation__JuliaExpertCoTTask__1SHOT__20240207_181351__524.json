When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It takes advantage of multiple cores on your machine, significantly speeding up the process if you are working with a large number of words. \n\nThe function pig_latinify first checks whether the word starts with a vowel or consonant and applies the appropriate transformation to move the initial letter (or letters) to the end of the word along with adding \"ay\" or \"way\". The transformed word is then stored in an Array which is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,404],"elapsed":11.515610594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
