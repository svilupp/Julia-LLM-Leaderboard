It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split string into words\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n\n    # Create a thread pool with 4 threads\n    tpool = ThreadPool(4)\n\n    # Iterate over each word and apply the pig latin transformation in parallel\n    for (i, w) in enumerate(words)\n        @spawnat :any begin\n            words[i] = pig_latinify(w)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish\n    wait.(tpool)\n\n    return join(words, \" \")\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `ThreadPool` module from Julia's standard library to create a thread pool with 4 threads. The `pig_latinify` function then iterates over each word in the input string and applies the pig latin transformation in parallel using the `spawnat` macro. Finally, it waits for all threads to finish using the `wait` method before returning the transformed string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input string is space-separated words. If the input string contains other types of whitespace or non-word characters, you may need to modify the `split` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[116,302],"elapsed":7.253981769,"_type":"aimessage"}]
