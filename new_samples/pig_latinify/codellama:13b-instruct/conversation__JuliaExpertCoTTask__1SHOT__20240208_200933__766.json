The `pig_latinify` function iterates over each word in the input vector and transforms it to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_word` function. The `pig_latinify_word` function splits the word into individual characters, moves each character to the end of the string, and removes the original position of each character.\n\nTo use this implementation, you can call the `pig_latinify` function with a vector of strings as input:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words) # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldwaway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[205,506],"elapsed":12.228872806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
