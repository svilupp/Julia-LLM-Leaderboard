We define a function called `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of transformed strings. Inside this function, we use `@parallel (strings)` to start a new thread for each string in the input vector.\n\nInside each thread, we split the string into words using the `split` function, and then iterate over each word to change it to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_word` function. Finally, we return the transformed string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_word` function takes a single word as input and returns the transformed word in pig latin format. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it simply adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all strings in the input vector are valid words. If any of the strings contain special characters or spaces, you may need to modify the `split` function to handle them properly.","status":200,"tokens":[78,512],"elapsed":12.145200638,"_type":"aimessage"}]
