Each thread is responsible for changing a single word in the vector of strings.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of strings as an argument, like this:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinify(strings) # => [\"ellohway\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,373],"elapsed":8.837300397,"_type":"aimessage"}]
