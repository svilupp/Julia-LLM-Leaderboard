[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector with the same length containing the pig latin versions of each string.\n2. The function uses the `Base.Threads` module to start multiple threads for each iteration. Each thread will operate on a separate string in the input vector and return its pig latin version.\n3. The `mapreduce` function is used to map each string to a new thread, reduce the results of all threads into a single vector, and combine them using the `vcat` function.\n4. Inside each thread, we first check if the first character of the input string is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha` function. If it is, we convert it to lowercase using the `lowercase` function and add \"ay\" to the end of the string. Otherwise, we return the original string unchanged.\n5. The resulting vector of pig latin strings is returned by the `pig_latinify` function.","status":200,"tokens":[378,399],"elapsed":9.948368801,"_type":"aimessage"}]
