[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses the `ThreadPool` module from the Julia standard library to create a thread pool with the number of cores on the system. It then iterates over each word in the input string, changes it to pig latin in parallel using multiple threads, and finally joins the words back together into a single string before returning it.\n\nThe `_pig_latinify_word` function is used internally by `pig_latinify` to transform a single word to pig latin. It first gets the first letter of the word and moves it to the end using `popfirst!`. Then, it adds \"ay\" to the end of the word using string concatenation.\n\nNote that this implementation uses multiple threads for parallelism, but it does not use any specialized packages or libraries to do so. It is a simple example of how to use Julia's threading model to achieve concurrency in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[378,477],"elapsed":11.837492629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
