[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation is performed by the `pig_latin` function, which takes a single string as input and returns the transformed string.\n\nTo apply the Pig Latin transformation on multiple strings in parallel, we use the `ThreadsX` package and its `ThreadsX.foreach` method to iterate over each string in the vector and perform the transformation on each string separately. This allows us to take advantage of multi-core processing and speed up the computation.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function moves the first letter of the input word to the end of the word, and then returns the modified word as output. We use string interpolation (`$`) to insert the first letter into the rest of the word.\n\nWe test the function by passing in a single string \"hello world\" and printing out the transformed result.","status":200,"tokens":[378,437],"elapsed":10.86715137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
