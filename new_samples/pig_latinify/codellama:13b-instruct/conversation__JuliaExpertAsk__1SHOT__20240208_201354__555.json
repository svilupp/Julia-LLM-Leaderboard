We also define another function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and applies the first function to each string in parallel using threads. The resulting vector of pig latin forms is returned.\n\nNote that we use the `@spawn` macro to create a thread that runs the first function on each string in parallel. This allows us to take advantage of multiple CPU cores for faster computation.","status":200,"tokens":[116,485],"elapsed":11.562636813,"_type":"aimessage"}]
