We iterate over each word in the input vector and transform it to pig latin using the formula `$(word[2:end])$(word[1])ay`. The transformed word is then added to an output vector, which we return at the end.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input words are all lowercase. If you want to handle uppercase letters as well, you will need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[205,271],"elapsed":6.676483282,"_type":"aimessage"}]
