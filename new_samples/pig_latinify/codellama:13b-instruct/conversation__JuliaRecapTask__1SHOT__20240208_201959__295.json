X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* `Threads.@threads` to parallelize the loop over the vector of strings.\n\t* `isempty(x)` to check if a string is empty.\n\t* `filter(isempty, x)` to filter out any empty strings from the input vector.\n2. Solve the task:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::String)\n    # Convert each character in the string to lowercase\n    str = lowercase(str)\n    \n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if isempty(str)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the string and transform it to pig latin\n    words = split(str)\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        # If the word starts with a vowel, append \"way\" to the end\n        if first(word) âˆˆ (\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\")\n            word *= \"way\"\n        # Otherwise, move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\"\n        else\n            word = string(word[2:end], first(word), \"ay\")\n        end\n        \n        words[i] = word\n    end\n    \n    return join(words)\nend\n\n# Parallelize the loop over the vector of strings using Threads.@threads\nfunction pig_latinify(str::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for str in filter(isempty, str)\n        pig_latinify(str)\n    end\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* The function `pig_latinify` takes a string as input and transforms it to pig latin according to the given rules.\n\t* If the input string is empty, an empty string is returned.\n\t* If the input string starts with a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end of the word. Otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end and \"ay\" is appended.\n\t* The function `pig_latinify` returns a string in pig latin format.\n\t* The function `pig_latinify` can be applied to each element of an input vector of strings using `Threads.@threads`.","status":200,"tokens":[378,536],"elapsed":13.30582863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
