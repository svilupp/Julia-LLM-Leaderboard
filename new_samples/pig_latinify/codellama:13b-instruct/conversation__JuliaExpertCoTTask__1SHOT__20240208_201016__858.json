We then iterate over each word in parallel using threads by using the `@threads` macro from Julia's standard library `Threads`. For each iteration, we transform the current word to pig latin and add it to the `transformed_words` vector. Finally, we return the transformed words as a vector of strings.\n\nNote that we use the `push!` function to add elements to the `transformed_words` vector in a thread-safe manner. This is because the `push!` function can only be called from the main thread, and any additional threads will need to use a locking mechanism to ensure that the vector is updated correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[205,301],"elapsed":7.346282404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
