You can do this by getting the id of the element and then using its id in css. Something like this should work for you:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<script>\nvar myElement = document.getElementById(\"myId\");\ndocument.getElementById('element').style.top = '50px'; //you can give any value instead of 50px\n</script>\n\\end{code}","status":200,"tokens":[116,6373],"elapsed":157.991456786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
