The function uses a for loop to iterate over each word in the input vector, and checks if the first letter is a vowel using a conditional statement. If it's not a vowel, the function adds the first letter to the end of the word and pushes the result to the transformed words vector.\n\nNote that this code assumes that all input strings are valid English words. It does not perform any checks or validations on the input data.","status":200,"tokens":[205,402],"elapsed":9.72822842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
