The function uses the `@spawn` macro to iterate over each string in parallel using multiple threads.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function calls another helper function, `pig_latinify`, which performs a single Pig Latin transformation on a given string. This function checks if the word is empty or consists only of spaces and returns an empty string in those cases. Otherwise, it gets the first letter of the word, checks if it's a vowel, and returns the transformed string accordingly.\n\nYou can use this function by calling `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\"])`, which will return the vector `[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[78,487],"elapsed":11.538631595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
