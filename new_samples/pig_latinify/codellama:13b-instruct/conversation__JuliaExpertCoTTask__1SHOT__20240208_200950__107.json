The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of transformed strings. Each element in the returned vector is the result of applying the `pig_latinify` function to the corresponding element in the input vector.\n\nThe implementation uses three helper functions:\n\n* `pig_latinify`: This function takes a single string as input and returns its pig latin transformation. It splits the input string into words, applies the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word, and joins the transformed words back into a string using spaces.\n* `pig_latinify_word`: This function takes a single word as input and returns its pig latin transformation. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and if so, adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\".\n* `split`: This function splits a string into words using spaces as delimiters.\n* `join`: This function joins an array of strings together into a single string using a specified delimiter. In this case, we use spaces to join the transformed words back into a string.","status":200,"tokens":[205,682],"elapsed":16.459197586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
