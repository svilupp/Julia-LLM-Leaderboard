It then iterates over each string in the input vector and applies the transformation to it in parallel using the `@spawnat` macro, which is part of the `Distributed` module as well.\n\nThe `piglatinify` function takes a single string argument and returns its Pig Latin equivalent. This function can be defined separately and called from within the loop above.\n```julia\nfunction piglatinify(s::String)\n    # Your implementation here\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,283],"elapsed":6.731233783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
