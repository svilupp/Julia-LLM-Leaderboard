[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function using Julia's `Threads` module:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in 'aeiou'\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        return string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the processing of each word in the input vector. It creates a new `result` vector and fills it with the pig latin versions of the words in the input vector, which are computed by the `pig_latin_word` function. If the first letter of a word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input vector does not contain any empty strings. You may want to add error checking code to handle such cases according to your specific needs. Also note that this version uses 1-based indexing as per Julia's convention, so the first letter of a word is `word[1]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,357],"elapsed":9.144667505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
