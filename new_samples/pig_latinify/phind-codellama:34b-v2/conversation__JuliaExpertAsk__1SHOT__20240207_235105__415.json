It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code snippet that implements your requirement. We will use the Julia's `Threads` module for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    remaining_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$remaining_word$first_letter\" * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the corresponding pig latin translations. The function creates an uninitialized vector of the same size as the input, and then iterates over the input in parallel, storing the result directly into the output.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function is a helper function that translates a single string to pig latin. It moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\" at the end. \n\nPlease note that the Julia language does not guarantee the order of execution for threads. Thus, the transformed words may not be in the same order as the original words.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":7.810590334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
