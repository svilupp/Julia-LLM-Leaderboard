It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a language game that children use to speak in code. When playing, words in English are altered by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial cluster of consonals to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such term. \n\nHere's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    threads = []\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn begin\n            if isempty(word) || all(isspace, word)\n                # Ignore empty and space-only strings.\n            else\n                result[i] = pig_latinify(word)\n            end\n        end)\n    end\n    foreach(wait, threads)  # Wait for all threads to finish.\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    # Remove leading whitespace.\n    while !isempty(word) && isspace(word[1])\n        word = word[2:end]\n    end\n\n    first_vowel = findfirst(c -> c in \"aeiouAEIOU\", word)\n    if first_vowel === nothing\n        # No vowels, just move the whole word to the end.\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    elseif first_vowel > 1\n        # Move initial consonants to the end and add \"ay\".\n        return word[first_vowel:end] * word[1:first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # First letter is a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end.\n        return word * \"way\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code will transform the vector of words to their Pig Latin equivalents in parallel. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there are no words with digits or punctuation. If you expect such words, you'll need to modify `pig_latinify(word::String)` method accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,509],"elapsed":12.978043696,"_type":"aimessage"}]
