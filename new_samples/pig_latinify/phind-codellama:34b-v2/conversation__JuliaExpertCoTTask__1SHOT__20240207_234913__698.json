Each word is processed concurrently in its own thread. The conversion rules are as follows: if the first letter of the word is a vowel, \"way\" is appended to the end of the word. Otherwise, all characters before the initial vowel are moved to the end and \"ay\" is added to the end.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all input words have at least one vowel. The result may be incorrect for words without vowels. You can add a check for words with no vowels and handle such cases according to your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,396],"elapsed":10.079141425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
