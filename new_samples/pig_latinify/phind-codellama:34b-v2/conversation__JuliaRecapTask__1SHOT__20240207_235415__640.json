[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

If a word starts with a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end. Here is the Julia implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads  # Needed for creating threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(isequal(word[1]), vowels)\n        return string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latin` function first checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel. If it is, it simply adds \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it finds the first occurrence of this letter in the 'vowels' array and moves all letters before it to the end of the word, then adds \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function applies the pig latin transformation to each word in the input vector in parallel using multiple threads. The results are stored in a pre-allocated result vector, which is returned at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":11.397215702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
