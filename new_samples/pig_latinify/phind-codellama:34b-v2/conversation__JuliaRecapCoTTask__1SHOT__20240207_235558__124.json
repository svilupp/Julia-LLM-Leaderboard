[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function will convert each word in a vector of strings to its pig latin equivalent. We assume that by \"Special Instructions\" you mean additional requirements or constraints on the problem, and there are none provided here.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        # Pig Latin rule: move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\"\n        pig_latin_word = \"$rest_of_word$first_letter\" * \"ay\"\n        results[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function first allocates a `results` vector to store the transformed words. It then uses a multithreaded for loop to transform each word in the input vector. The transformation itself consists of extracting the first letter of the current word, appending it at the end and adding \"ay\" at the end.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"piglatin\"]\npig_latinify(words) # => [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"iglatinpay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":9.476689065,"_type":"aimessage"}]
