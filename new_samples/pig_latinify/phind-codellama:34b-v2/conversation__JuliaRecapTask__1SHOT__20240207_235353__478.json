[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using the `Threads` module in Julia. Note that this example assumes that words are only composed of English consonants and vowels, and does not take into account special cases or irregular verb forms.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = lowercase(words[i])\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        \n        if first_letter == 'a' || first_letter == 'e' || first_letter == 'i' || first_letter == 'o' || first_letter == 'u'\n            result[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new vector and fills it with the pig latin versions of each word in `words`. The `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module is used to parallelize the operation over every index in `words`. Note that the order of the output words might not be the same as the input order due to the parallel computation.\n\nKeep in mind, this simple approach might not work for all cases of English words since pig latin has a few exceptions and complex rules. It's always recommended to have a good understanding of the problem domain before implementing a solution.","status":200,"tokens":[372,345],"elapsed":9.156279497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
