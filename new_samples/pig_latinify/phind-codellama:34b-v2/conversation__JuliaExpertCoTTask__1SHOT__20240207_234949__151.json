Here, pig Latin is a simple and fun code challenge where you move the first letter to the end and then add \"ay\" at the end. For example, \"hello\" becomes \"ellohay\".\n\nBelow is the Julia implementation for this problem using threading.\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadsX\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    first = word[1]\n    rest = word[2:end]\n    return \"$rest$first\" * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction batch_pig_latinify(words)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    ThreadsX.threadsforeach((word, i) -> result[i] = pig_latinify(word), words)\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nTest the function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latins = batch_pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latins)\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```julia\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":7.559143513,"_type":"aimessage"}]
