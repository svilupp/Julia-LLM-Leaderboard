[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how you could write a `pig_latinify` function that converts a vector of strings into pig latin and does so on separate threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        if first_letter in 'a':'z' || first_letter in 'A':'Z'\n            result[i] = \"$rest_of_word$first_letter\" * \"ay\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word * \"ay\"  # keep non-alphabetic characters as is\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Threads.@threads` macro to run a for loop on multiple threads. The loop iterates over each index in the input vector and transforms the corresponding word into pig latin. The transformed words are stored in the pre-allocated `result` vector.\n\nNote that this version of the function uses simple heuristics to decide whether to move the first letter to the end of the word and append \"ay\". Non-alphabetic characters are kept as is. If you need a more sophisticated conversion rule, adjustments may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":9.126128271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
