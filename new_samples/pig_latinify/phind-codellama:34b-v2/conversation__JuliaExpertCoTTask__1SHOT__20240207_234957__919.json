We use the `@spawn` macro to create a separate thread for each word in the input vector. Each thread will handle one word, transform it to pig latin and store the result in its corresponding position in the `results` array. After all threads finish their tasks, we return the `results` array.\n\nTesting this function with your example:\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]))  # output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"strongay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":8.54007798,"_type":"aimessage"}]
