Here is an implementation of your problem using multi-threading:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    if word[1] in 'a':'z' || word[1] in 'A':'Z'\n        return word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\"\n    else\n        return word\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(sentence::Vector{String})\n    n = length(sentence)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    threads = Vector{Threads.Thread}(undef, n)\n\n    for i in 1:n\n        threads[i] = Threads.@spawn begin\n            result[i] = pig_latinify(sentence[i])\n        end\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:n\n        wait(threads[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first declare a helper function `pig_latinify` that transforms a single word to pig-latin if the word starts with a letter. Then we define our main function `pig_latinify`, which takes as input a vector of words. We create a result vector and a thread vector, both with the same length as the input.\n\nWe then spawn a new thread for each word in the input. Each thread applies the `pig_latinify` function to a single word from the input vector, and stores the result in the corresponding position in the result vector. After all threads have been started, we wait for them to finish using the `wait` function, and finally return the result vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,414],"elapsed":10.427475754,"_type":"aimessage"}]
