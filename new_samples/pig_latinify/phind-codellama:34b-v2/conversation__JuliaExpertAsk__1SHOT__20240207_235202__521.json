It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Threads` module in Julia for parallel computing. Here's an example implementation of your `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        if first_letter in 'aeiou'\n            result[i] = \"$wordway\"\n        else\n            result[i] = \"$rest_of_word$first_letteray\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nHere, `pig_latinify` takes a vector of words as input and returns a new vector where each word has been converted to pig latin. The conversion rules are as follows: if the first letter of the word is a vowel, append \"way\" to the end of the word; otherwise, move the first letter to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the for loop. Each iteration runs on a separate thread. The result vector is preallocated with the same length as the input vector to avoid resizing during the computation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":7.919954107,"_type":"aimessage"}]
