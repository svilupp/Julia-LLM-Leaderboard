It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    # Use multi-threading for better performance\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        result[i] = \"$rest_of_word$first_letter\" * \"ay\"\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we make use of Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities provided by the `Base.Threads` module. The `Threads.@threads` macro allows for simple parallelization of a loop. We simply pass our words vector to it and then perform the pig latin transformation inside the loop body.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\"]))  # [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\nThis will print `[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]`, which are the words \"hello\" and \"world\" transformed into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":7.467439114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
