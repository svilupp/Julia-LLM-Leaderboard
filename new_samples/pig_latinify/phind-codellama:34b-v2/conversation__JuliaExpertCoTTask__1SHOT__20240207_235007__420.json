Then, it defines the main function `threaded_pig_latinify`, which applies `pig_latinify` to each element in the input vector using multiple threads. Note that this code uses the ThreadsX package for extended threading functionalities in Julia. If you don't have ThreadsX installed, you can add it by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"ThreadsX\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,381],"elapsed":9.683839986,"_type":"aimessage"}]
