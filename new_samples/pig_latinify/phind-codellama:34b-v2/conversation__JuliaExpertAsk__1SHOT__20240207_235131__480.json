Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Pig Latin Transformer function in Julia using multi-threading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_arr::Vector{String})\n    n = length(input_arr)\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        word = input_arr[i]\n        first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n        \n        if first_letter == 'a' || first_letter == 'e' || first_letter == 'i' ||\n           first_letter == 'o' || first_letter == 'u'\n            result[i] = word * \"way\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nTo use this function, you can call it with a vector of strings like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\nThis function takes as input a vector of strings and transforms each string to Pig Latin using multiple threads for parallelism. If the first letter of the word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":8.874558102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
