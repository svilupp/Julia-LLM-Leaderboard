The function uses the Julia Threads module to run each conversion in a separate thread, which should improve performance for large inputs. Note that this code assumes that words are valid and only contain alphabetic characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":5.83956545,"_type":"aimessage"}]
