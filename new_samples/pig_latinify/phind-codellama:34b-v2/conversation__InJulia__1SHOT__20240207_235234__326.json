The transformed strings are stored in a new vector, which is returned at the end.\n\nPlease note that Pig Latin transformation rules can vary depending on the source you refer to. In this function, I followed the most common set of rules: \n1. If the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n2. If the word begins with a consonant, move all letters until the first vowel to the end and then add \"ay\". \n\nPlease also note that Julia's multithreading is designed for performance improvements on parallel tasks, not for concurrent tasks that can be executed in any order, so using threads might not always speed up this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,461],"elapsed":11.637668068,"_type":"aimessage"}]
