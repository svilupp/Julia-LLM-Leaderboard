It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Example\n\nInput:\n```rust\nlet input = [\"the\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\"];\n```\nOutput:\n```rust\n[\"ethay\", \"ickquay\", \"ownbray\", \"oxfay\"]\n```\n\n### Specification\n- Pig Latin is a way of altering English Words. The rules are as follows:\n\t1. For words beginning with consonants, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add ay.\n\t2. If a word begins with a vowel you just add way at the end.\n- Words can be split into consonant and vowel groups. The consonants always come first, so for example `the` has one consonant group (`th`) and one vowel group (`e`). `quick` has three consonant groups (`qu`, `ck`, `k`), and one vowel group (`i`).\n- If a word begins with two or more consonants that form a single sound, such as \"ch\", treat it as a single consonant. So for example `change` starts with ch, not c.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":7.167982387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
