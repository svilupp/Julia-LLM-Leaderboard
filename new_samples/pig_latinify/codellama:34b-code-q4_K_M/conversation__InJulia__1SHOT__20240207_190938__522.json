If the word begins with a vowel, append \"ay\" to the end. \n2. Otherwise, move all of the non-vowels at the beginning of the word to the end and add \"ay\".\n3. If any words begin with two or more consonants, group them together into a single consonant block. For example, \"st\" is treated as one letter, not two letters.\n4.
