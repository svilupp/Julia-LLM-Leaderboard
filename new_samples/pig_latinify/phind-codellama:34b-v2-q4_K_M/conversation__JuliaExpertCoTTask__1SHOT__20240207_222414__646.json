If given a single string, it converts that word to pig latin according to the rules: if the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end; if the word begins with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nIf given a vector of strings, it creates an empty result vector, and then uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the conversion process across multiple threads. Each thread converts a single word to pig latin and stores the result in the corresponding position in the results vector. Finally, it returns the results vector.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":9.276518346,"_type":"aimessage"}]
