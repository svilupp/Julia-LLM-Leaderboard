It uses the `@threads for` macro to perform each translation in a separate thread. Each thread writes its result directly into the corresponding position in the `results` array, which is preallocated for efficiency.\n\nThe function `word_to_pig_latin` performs the actual pig latin transformation on a single word. It checks whether the first character of the word is a letter and adjusts the case accordingly. If the word does not start with a letter, it returns an error message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":9.956712717,"_type":"aimessage"}]
