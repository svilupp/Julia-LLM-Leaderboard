It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    results\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a vector of strings and initializes another vector of the same size to store the transformed words. It then uses the `@threads` macro to perform each transformation in a separate thread. Note that Julia's threads are actually tasks, and this is more efficient than using actual OS threads due to communication overhead.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function itself could be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    remaining_word = word[2:end]\n    return \"$remaining_word$first_letter\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single string and moves its first letter to the end, which is the basic rule for transforming a word into Pig Latin. Note that this implementation assumes the input word is a valid non-empty string; if such input might not be the case, additional error checking should be added.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.4693761,"_type":"aimessage"}]
