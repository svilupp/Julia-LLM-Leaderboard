It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a type of word play, where you move the first letter of the word to the end followed by \"ay\". If the word starts with a vowel, we simply add \"way\" at the end. Here's a simple implementation using `Threads`:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    function pig_latin!(word, i)\n        if word[1] in 'a':'z'\n            result = lowercase(word[2:end]) * lowercase(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n        else\n            result = lowercase(word) * \"way\"\n        end\n        results[i] = result\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        pig_latin!(words[i], i)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNote: Julia's `Threads` are not actual operating system threads. They are a form of green thread or user-space thread known as \"coroutines\", which is more efficient for some data-parallel problems. If you need true parallelism with multi-core support, consider using the `Base.Threads` module from Julia's standard library (as shown above), or the `Distributed` module for distributed computations.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # prints: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":10.336121507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
