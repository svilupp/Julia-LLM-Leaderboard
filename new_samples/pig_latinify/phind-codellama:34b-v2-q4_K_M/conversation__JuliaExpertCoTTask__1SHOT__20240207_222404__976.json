It creates a results array to store transformed words, and then iterates over each word in the input vector, applying the pig latin transformation function in separate threads. The transformed words are stored in the results array.\n\nThe second function is the actual pig latin transformation function that operates on individual strings. It checks if the first character of the word is a letter. If it is, it moves this first character to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the first character is not a letter (for example, if it's a punctuation mark or a digit), it leaves the word unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":8.601143105,"_type":"aimessage"}]
