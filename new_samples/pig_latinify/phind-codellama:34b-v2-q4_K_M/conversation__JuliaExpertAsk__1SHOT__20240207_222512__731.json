However, note that Julia might not be the best choice if you need to parallelize CPU-bound tasks due to its single-threaded nature. Nevertheless, here's an example of how you could implement pig latin transformation using threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = uppercase(word[1])\n        \n        if first_letter < 'A' || first_letter > 'Z'\n            results[i] = word  # non-alphabetic characters, just copy the word\n        else\n            results[i] = string(word[2:end], word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro will divide the iterations among available threads. Keep in mind that threading may not always improve performance due to Julia's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and the overhead of creating and managing threads.\n\nFor CPU-bound tasks, you might be better off using parallel processing with packages such as Distributed or running Julia with multiple threads from the command line (`julia -t nthread`).","status":200,"tokens":[102,318],"elapsed":8.831067242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
