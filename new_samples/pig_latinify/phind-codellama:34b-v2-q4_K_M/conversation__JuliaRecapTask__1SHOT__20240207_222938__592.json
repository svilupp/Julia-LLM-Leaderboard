[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses Julia's built-in multithreading functionality to run each translation in a separate thread for better performance. Note that Julia threads are not lightweight, and their creation is relatively expensive. Therefore, this approach is most effective when the input contains many words and each word's translation requires a significant amount of processing time.\n\nThis function follows standard pig latin rules: if a word starts with a vowel, it just gets \"ay\" appended to it. If a word starts with a consonant, all the letters before the first vowel are moved to the end of the word, then \"ay\" is appended.\n```julia\njulia> pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"world\"])\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":10.150412377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
