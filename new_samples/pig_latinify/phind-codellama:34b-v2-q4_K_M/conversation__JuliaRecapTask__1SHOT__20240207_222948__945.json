X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, Julia's native multithreaded execution model differs from traditional thread-based models in that it employs a cooperative multitasking system. Therefore, we can use `Threads.@spawn` to create multiple tasks that run concurrently on separate threads.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n    @threads for i in eachindex(input)\n        # Pig Latin rules: move the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and add \"ay\"\n        words = split(input[i])\n        first_letter = match(r\"[aeiou]\", words[1]).match\n        words[1] = replace(words[1], first_letter => \"\", count=1) * \"ay\"\n        results[i] = join(words, \" \")\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings and creates an empty vector `results` with the same length. The `@threads for` loop iterates over each index in the input array and concurrently applies the Pig Latin transformation on each string. Finally, the transformed strings are stored in the `results` vector.\n\nPlease note that the provided implementation assumes that the first letter of each word is always a consonant, which may not be true for words starting with \"y\". In this case, you might need to add an extra rule to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":10.49022806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
