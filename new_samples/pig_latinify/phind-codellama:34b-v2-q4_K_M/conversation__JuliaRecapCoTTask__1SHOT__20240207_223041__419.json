[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        \n        if first_letter in 'a':'z' || first_letter in 'A':'Z'\n            results[i] = string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n        else\n            results[i] = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\nThis function creates a new vector `results` to store the transformed words. It then uses the `@threads` macro to parallelize the operation over each word in the input vector. \n\nFor each word, it captures the first letter and then concatenates the remainder of the word with the first letter and \"ay\". This is the basic transformation rule for pig latin. Words that don't start with a letter are left unchanged. The transformed words are stored in `results`. \n\nNote: Pig Latin rules can vary, so this function might need adjustments depending on how you want to handle specific cases (e.g., words starting with vowels, punctuation, etc.).\n\nAlso note that the actual parallelization and multithreading might not bring significant performance improvements for small inputs, but for larger inputs it should lead to a speedup.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":9.429818295,"_type":"aimessage"}]
