[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution using Julia's standard library for multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base: Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = first(word)\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        \n        if first_letter in 'a':'z' || first_letter in 'A':'Z'\n            results[i] = string(rest_of_word, first_letter, \"ay\")\n        else\n            results[i] = word  # ignore words starting with non-alphabetic characters\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates an output vector of the same size as the input vector and fills it with the pig latin versions of each word. It assumes that a word should be converted to pig latin if its first letter is an English alphabet character, and in that case it appends \"ay\" to the end of the rest of the word.\n\nIt uses Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to distribute the work over available threads. Each thread processes one element of the input vector, converts the corresponding word to pig latin, and stores the result in the output vector. The use of `undef` when creating the results vector means that it is initially filled with `UndefInitializer()` instances, which are later replaced with actual strings by the threads.\n\nThis code assumes that the input words only consist of English alphabet characters and ignores words starting with non-alphabetic characters. If you want to handle other cases (e.g., accented letters), you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[372,411],"elapsed":11.736711083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
