[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll use Julia's built-in multithreading support through the `Threads` module. We will define a function that transforms a single word into pig latin and then apply this transformation to each word in the input vector across multiple threads. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif word[1] in 'a':'z' && word[2] in 'a':'z'\n        return word[2:end]*word[1:1]*\"ay\"\n    else\n        return word*\"ay\"  # handle words starting with vowels or special characters\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNote that the `pig_latinify` function is split into two parts. The first part creates an output vector of the appropriate size and then launches a multithreaded loop to transform each input word. The second part defines how to transform a single word into pig latin.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the words are in lowercase and don't have any punctuation. You may need to adjust it if your inputs have different properties.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":9.567965357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
