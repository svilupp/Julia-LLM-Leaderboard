[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Threads` module to parallelize your code with threads. However, note that Julia may not create new OS threads for threads spawned using the `Threads` module depending on your system configuration and the number of threads you are creating. \n\nHere's a simple implementation of pig latin transformation function which uses multiple threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = uppercase(word[1])\n        \n        if first_letter in 'A':'Z'\n            results[i] = word[2:end] * string(first_letter, \"ay\")\n        else\n            # If the first letter is not a capital letter, leave it as is\n            results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of words and transforms each word to pig latin. It uses Julia's threading functionality to run the transformation in parallel for each word in the input vector. The transformed words are stored in a separate results vector.\n\nThe pig latin rule is: if the word starts with a vowel, add \"way\" at the end of the word; if it starts with a consonant, move all the consecutive consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and add \"ay\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all input words are capitalized. If your input words can be in arbitrary case, you might want to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":10.768844525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
