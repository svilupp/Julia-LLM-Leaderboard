It uses Julia's threading support to perform the transformation for each word in parallel. Each transformed word is stored into the corresponding position in the `results` array.\n\nThe pig latin transformation itself moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". \n\nThis code assumes that the input words are all lowercase and have no punctuation or special characters. More complex rules for handling capitalization, punctuation, etc., would be needed for a more robust implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.488464975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
