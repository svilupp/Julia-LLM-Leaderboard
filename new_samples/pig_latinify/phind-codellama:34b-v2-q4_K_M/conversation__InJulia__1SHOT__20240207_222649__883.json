The `pig_latinify` function creates an output array and then fills it in parallel. Each element of the input vector is transformed to pig latin by the `pig_latin_transform` function, which moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[72,332],"elapsed":9.16810035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
