[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Base: Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    if length(word) < 1\n        return word\n    elseif ismatch(r\"^[aeiou]\", lowercase(word)) # If the word starts with a vowel\n        return string(word, \"way\") \n    else # The word starts with a consonant \n        first_vowel = findfirst(c->ismatch(r\"[aeiou]\", c), word) # Find the position of the first vowel\n        return string(word[first_vowel:end], word[1:first_vowel-1], \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and transforms it into pig latin using multiple threads. Each thread will handle one string at a time, applying the `pig_latinify` transformation to that string. The transformed strings are stored in the `results` array which is returned once all threads have completed.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function for an individual word works by first checking if the word starts with a vowel or a consonant. If it starts with a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. If it starts with a consonant, it finds the position of the first vowel, appends \"ay\" to the end of the word and moves the initial consonants to the end of the word.\n\nNote that in order to use multiple threads in Julia, you need to start Julia with `julia -t n` where `n` is the number of threads you want to use. In this case, we are using the Threads.@threads macro which automatically utilizes all available threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,472],"elapsed":13.08411836,"_type":"aimessage"}]
