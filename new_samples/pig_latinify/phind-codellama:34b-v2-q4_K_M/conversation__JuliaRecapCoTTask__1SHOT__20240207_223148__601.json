[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The Pig Latin rule is: if a word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end; otherwise, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n\n```julia\nusing Base: Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n    \n    # We use a Channel for thread-safe communication between threads\n    input_channel = Channel(length(input)) do ch\n        for i in eachindex(input)\n            put!(ch, (i, input[i]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    @threads for _ in 1:length(input)\n        idx, word = take!(input_channel)\n        result[idx] = pig_latin_word(word)\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    if first_letter in 'a':'z' || first_letter in 'A':'Z'\n        # The word starts with a vowel, so add \"way\" to the end.\n        return \"$wordway\"\n    else\n        # Find the index of the first vowel.\n        first_vowel = findfirst(isequal(lowercase(first_letter)), \"aeiou\")\n        if first_vowel === nothing  # No vowels in word, so just add \"ay\".\n            return \"$worday\"\n        else\n            # Move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add \"ay\".\n            return \"$(word[first_vowel+1:end])$(word[1:first_vowel])ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code uses multiple threads to apply the `pig_latin_word` function on each word in the input vector. The `Channel` is used for thread-safe communication between threads. Note that Julia's threading model does not actually create OS threads (it uses green threads), but it provides a similar level of concurrency and this code can still benefit from multiple cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,523],"elapsed":14.51522656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
