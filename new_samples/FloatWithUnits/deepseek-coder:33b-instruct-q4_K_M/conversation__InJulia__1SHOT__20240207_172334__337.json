The `print` function is used to write a formatted version of its arguments to an IO stream (in this case, it's the standard output by default). The `string` function converts the value field into a string so that it can be concatenated with the unit field using a space as a separator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":5.746268927,"_type":"aimessage"}]
