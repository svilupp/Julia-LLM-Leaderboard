The `show` method is used to define how Julia should display your struct when you print it or use it in an interactive session. It takes two arguments: the first one (`io`) is a stream where the output should be written, and the second argument (`x`) is the object that should be displayed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":6.211238338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
