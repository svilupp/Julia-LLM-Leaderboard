The string() function is used to convert `value` into a string so we can concatenate it with the units.\n\nYou can use your struct like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(fwu) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nIn this code, an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is created with a value of 1.8 and unit \"meters\". The show method is called on the instance to print it in the required format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":8.694261253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
