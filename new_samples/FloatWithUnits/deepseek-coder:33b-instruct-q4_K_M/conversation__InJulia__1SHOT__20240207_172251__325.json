Both are of type `Float64` and `String` respectively.\n- We import the `show` function from the Base module so that we can extend its functionality.\n- In our custom show method, we create a string representation of the `FloatWithUnits` object by concatenating the value and unit fields with a space in between. This is then printed to the IO stream using the `print` function. The `io::IO` parameter is the IO stream where the output should be written.\n- Now, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, Julia will use our custom show method:\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(a)  # prints: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":8.185677104,"_type":"aimessage"}]
