This tells Julia that each `FloatWithUnits` object will have a field called `value` of type `Float64`, and another field called `unit` of type `String`.\n- `function Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` defines a new method for the built-in function `Base.show`. This method is applied whenever we try to print (or display) an object of type `FloatWithUnits`. The first argument (`io::IO`) is a stream where the output should be written, and the second argument (`fwu::FloatWithUnits`) is the object that is being printed.\n- Inside this method, we use the `print` function to write the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object to the given IO stream. The syntax `$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)` inserts the value and unit fields from the `FloatWithUnits` object into the string, separated by a space as required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":10.703653963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
