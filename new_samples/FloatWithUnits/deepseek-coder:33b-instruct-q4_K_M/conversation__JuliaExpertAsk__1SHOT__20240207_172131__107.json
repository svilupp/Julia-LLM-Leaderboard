Here is an example of how you might do this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nimport Base.show\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) \n    print(io, string(fwu.value), \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the `Base.show` function is overloaded to take an IO stream and a FloatWithUnits struct as arguments. The `print` function from Base Julia library is used here which writes its output to the given IO stream. Here it takes in the value field of the FloatWithUnits structure, converts it into string using string() function, then concatenates it with space and unit field of the structure. \n\nNow you can use this struct as follows:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(fwu) # Outputs: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nThis will show the value and unit separated by a space in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[104,282],"elapsed":8.116777537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
