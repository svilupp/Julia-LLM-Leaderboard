We then import the Base.show function and redefine it for our new struct. The method takes an IO object (which represents where to write the output) and the FloatWithUnits object itself. It prints out the value field of x followed by the unit field.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":4.869272165,"_type":"aimessage"}]
