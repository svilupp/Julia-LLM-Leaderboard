The keyword `import Base.show` imports the built-in show function from Julia's standard library so we can define our own custom method for it. \n\n3. The function `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` defines a new method of the `show` function that takes an IO (input/output stream) and a FloatWithUnits object as arguments. Inside this function, we print the value and unit to the io stream separated by a space using string concatenation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":7.124166688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
