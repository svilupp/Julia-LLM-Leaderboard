The first argument of the function is an IO object (which represents where the output should be written), and the second argument is the FloatWithUnits object that should be displayed. Inside the function, `print` is used to write the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object to io.","status":200,"tokens":[73,199],"elapsed":5.741952809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
