The parameters are: \n- `io::IO` which stands for input/output stream.\n- `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is an instance of the FloatWithUnits struct.\n\nThe function uses `print` to print out the value and unit separated by a space. This will result in output like \"1.8 meters\". Please note that the `Base.show` method needs to be imported from Base module, which Julia automatically does when you start a new session or execute `using Base`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":6.523739009,"_type":"aimessage"}]
