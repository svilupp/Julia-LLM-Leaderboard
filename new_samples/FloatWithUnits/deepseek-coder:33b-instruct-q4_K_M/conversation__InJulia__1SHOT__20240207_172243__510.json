Below is an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a show method for our struct\nimport Base.show\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(x.value), \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first defined a new `struct` named `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit`. Then we imported the `Base.show` function from Julia's standard library and overloaded it to print our struct in the format \"1.8 meters\". The `string()` function is used to convert the numerical value into a string so that it can be concatenated with the unit using the `print()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":5.943409227,"_type":"aimessage"}]
