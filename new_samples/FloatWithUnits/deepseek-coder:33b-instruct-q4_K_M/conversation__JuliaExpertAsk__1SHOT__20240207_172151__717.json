Both are of type `Float64` and `String` respectively.\n- The function `Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)` is the show method for our new struct. This method will print out the value and unit separated by a space when we call it on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. Here, `io` stands for \"I/O\", which is the standard way in Julia to pass data around.\n- We use `println(io, string(x.value) * \" \" * x.unit)` to concatenate the value and unit with a space as per your requirement. The `string()` function converts a number into a string. The '*' operator is used for string concatenation in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":8.228926872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
