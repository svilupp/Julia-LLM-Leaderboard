Here's an example of what you could do:\n\n```julia\nusing Measurements\n\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the above code `Base.show()` is a built-in function in Julia which defines how to display an object. The first argument is an IO stream where you can write your output, and the second is the object that you want to print. In this case, we're using our `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\nYou can then use it like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # Will output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":7.142418404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
