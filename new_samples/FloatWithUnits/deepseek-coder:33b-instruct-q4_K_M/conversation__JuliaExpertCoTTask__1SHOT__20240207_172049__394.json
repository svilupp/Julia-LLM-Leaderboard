Note that you need to define the struct `FloatWithUnits` first. \n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nThe `Base.show` function is a special method in Julia for printing user-defined types. We've defined the show function to print the value and unit separated by a space. \n\nYou can test it with:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # This will output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":5.410426074,"_type":"aimessage"}]
