We defined a new method for the `show` function that takes an IO object (which is usually stdout, but can be redirected) and a `FloatWithUnits` object as arguments. Inside this method, we concatenate the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` object with a space in between and write it to the IO object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":6.550840037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
