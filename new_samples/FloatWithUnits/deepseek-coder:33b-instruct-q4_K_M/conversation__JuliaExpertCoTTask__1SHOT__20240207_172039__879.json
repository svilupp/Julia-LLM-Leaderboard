The `io::IO` argument is a stream that the result will be written into. In this case, we're using it with `print` to write our string into it. We convert the `value` field to a string before concatenating it with the unit and space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.434306942,"_type":"aimessage"}]
