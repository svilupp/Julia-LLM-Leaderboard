You will also need to define a show method for it. Here's an example solution.\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThe show method is used to provide a human-readable string representation of the struct for output. The `Base` in front of it is Julia's way of saying that this function is part of the base language and can be overridden by user-defined types. \n\nYou can then test your code with:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)\n```\nThis will output: `1.8 meters`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":6.152459138,"_type":"aimessage"}]
