We use interpolation of string literals and the `println` function from the standard library to do this.\n\nIf you create a FloatWithUnits object like so:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\n\nYou can then print it as follows:\n\n```julia\nshow(fwu)\n# Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":6.380207051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
