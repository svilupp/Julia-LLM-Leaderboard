[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since we need to define a new struct called `FloatWithUnits`, let's create one first:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:AbstractFloat}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nNow that the `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined, we can proceed to define a custom `show` method for it. Here's how you would do it:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$($(fwu.value)) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nThis `show` method takes an instance of a `FloatWithUnits` struct as well as an `IO` stream to write the output into. The `print()` function is used to print the value and unit with spaces in between, following the instructions given.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":5.719816168,"_type":"aimessage"}]
