The `show` method is used for displaying objects when they are printed or displayed. Here's how you can define the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nThis will concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space when you try to display an object of type `FloatWithUnits`. Now, let's test it:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu1 = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(fwu1)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see, the `show` method correctly displays the value and unit with a space between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,273],"elapsed":7.969438817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
