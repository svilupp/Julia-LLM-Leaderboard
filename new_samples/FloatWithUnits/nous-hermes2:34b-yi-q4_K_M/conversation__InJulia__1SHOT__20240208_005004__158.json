The `show` method is used to format how an object is displayed when printed in Julia. In this case, we want to concatenate the value and unit with a space:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how to use the `FloatWithUnits` struct with its new `show` method:\n```julia\njulia> using .UnitFloat # assuming your file is named UnitFloat.jl and is in the same directory as your Julia REPL session\n\njulia> a = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> b = FloatWithUnits(42, \"miles\")\n42 miles\n```\nNow when you create an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and display it using `print()` or simply typing its name in Julia's REPL, you should see the value and unit concatenated with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.557528606,"_type":"aimessage"}]
