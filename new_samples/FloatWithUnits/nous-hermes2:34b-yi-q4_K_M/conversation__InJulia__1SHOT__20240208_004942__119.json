By default, Julia will print the struct with its field names like this:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(value=1.8, unit=\"meters\")\n```\nTo change how it is printed, we can define a custom `show` method for the struct:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$($fwu.value) $$(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nNow when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will be displayed as:\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\nThis format is similar to what you wanted in your question. The `show` method takes an output stream (`io`) and the struct object (`fwu`) as arguments. Inside the function body, we use string interpolation (`$`) to include the values of the fields `value` and `unit` separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":9.20939493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
