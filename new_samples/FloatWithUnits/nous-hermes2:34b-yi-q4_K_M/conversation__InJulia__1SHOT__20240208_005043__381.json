Here's how you can define your struct and implement the `show` method in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit))\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and use the `show` method to display them:\n\n```julia\njulia> meters = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"m\")\n\"1.8 m\"\n\njulia> miles = FloatWithUnits(3.0, \"mi\")\n\"3 mi\"\n```\n\nIn the example above, `meters` and `miles` are instances of `FloatWithUnits` with values `1.8` meters and `3.0` miles respectively. The `show` method is called implicitly when you try to display these objects using the double quotes (`\"\"`) or by passing them to a function that expects an output like this.\n\nYou can customize the behavior of the `show` method based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":7.913727583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
