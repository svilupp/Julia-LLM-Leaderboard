The `show` method is responsible for displaying the value and unit of a `FloatWithUnits` object in a specific format. In our case, we want to concatenate them with a space:\n\n```julia\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\n\nThe `show` method takes an `IO` object (in our case, `io`) and a `FloatWithUnits` object (`fwu`) as arguments. Inside the method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the value and unit with a space using the `print` function. The result is then displayed in the console or any other output device specified by the `IO` argument.","status":200,"tokens":[75,246],"elapsed":7.320029267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
