The `show` method is then extended for this new type to display the value and unit together with a space in between. You can test it by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,190],"elapsed":4.941420959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
