This function is called when we want to display the value of a variable with a specific type in the REPL or in a file. It takes two arguments: an `IO` stream (which stands for input/output) and the object we want to show, in this case, an instance of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nThe `print` function is used to write the formatted string \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\" into the `io` stream. The `$()` syntax inside the string is used for interpolation: it allows us to include the value of variables directly in the string, which makes the code more readable. \n\nHere's an example of how you can use this struct and its show method:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(\"The distance is: \", distance)\nThe distance is: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,320],"elapsed":8.064698549,"_type":"aimessage"}]
