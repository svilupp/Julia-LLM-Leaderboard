Then, we extend the `Base.show` function for instances of `FloatWithUnits`. This method takes an I/O stream (`io`) as its first argument and the object to be displayed (`x`) as its second argument. The `print` function is then used to display the `value` and `unit` fields of `x`, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":6.674469445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
