This is done to overwrite the default printing behaviour of Julia for our struct.\n- Inside the show function, we use `print` to write into the `io` stream (which usually represents stdout) the string interpolation of `$(x.value)`, a space, and `$(x.unit)`. The `$()` syntax is used for string interpolation in Julia, it evaluates the enclosed expression and inserts its value in the resulting string.\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, it will display the value and the unit concatenated with a space:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":8.332088748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
