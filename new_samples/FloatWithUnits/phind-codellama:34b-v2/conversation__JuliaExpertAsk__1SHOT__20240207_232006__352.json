Whenever a `FloatWithUnits` instance is printed to an I/O stream (like STDOUT), the defined method will be executed. The method takes an `IO` object (`io`) as its first argument and the instance of the struct as its second argument (`x`). It then prints out the `value` and `unit` fields of the instance, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":4.637020875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
