The `value` field is of type `Float64` and the `unit` field is of type `String`. \n\nThe `show` method is defined for this custom type inside the `Base` module. It takes two arguments, an IO stream (`io`) and an object of type `FloatWithUnits` (`x`). The `print` function is then used to display the value and unit of `x` in the format \"1.8 meters\" (for example) on the specified IO stream.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":5.510522918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
