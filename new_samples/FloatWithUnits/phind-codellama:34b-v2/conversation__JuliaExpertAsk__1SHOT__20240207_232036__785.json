The show method is then overloaded for objects of this type using the `Base.show` function. This method takes an IO object (`io`), which represents where the output is being sent (like stdout), and the object to be printed (`x`). Inside the function, we use the `print` function to write the value and unit separated by a space to the IO object.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":5.938310142,"_type":"aimessage"}]
