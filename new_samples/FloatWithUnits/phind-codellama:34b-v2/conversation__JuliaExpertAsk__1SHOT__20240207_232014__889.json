It takes two arguments, `io`, which is the I/O stream, and `x`, which is the instance of `FloatWithUnits` that we want to print. The `print` function writes to the `io` stream what we pass it - in this case, we're passing it `x.value`, a space, and `x.unit`.\n\nHere's how you can use this struct and method:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,263],"elapsed":6.637766687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
