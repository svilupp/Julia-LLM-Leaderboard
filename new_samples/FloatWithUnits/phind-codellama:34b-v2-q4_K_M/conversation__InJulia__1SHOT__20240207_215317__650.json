The `io::IO` argument is an object that abstracts away the details of where the output is going and how it is being formatted. In this case, we use `print` to write the value and unit separated by a space to the `io` object.\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, such as `x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`, and enter `x` into the REPL, it will display as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":6.432403261,"_type":"aimessage"}]
