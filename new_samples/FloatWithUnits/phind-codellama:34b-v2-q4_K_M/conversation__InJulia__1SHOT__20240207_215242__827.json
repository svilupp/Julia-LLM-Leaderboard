Inside the function, we use `print` to write the `value` field followed by a space and the `unit` field to the io stream. This way, when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will display the value and unit separated by a space, like \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":5.895107451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
