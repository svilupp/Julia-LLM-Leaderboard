The `show` method takes two arguments, an `io` object which is like a buffer that helps in writing the output, and `x` which is the instance of our struct that we want to display. \n\nWe use the `print` function to write the `value` and `unit` fields of our struct, separated by a space. This way, when an object of type `FloatWithUnits` is printed, it will show the value followed by the unit, just like \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":7.348270661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
