Let's do that:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn the code above, we defined our `FloatWithUnits` struct and implemented `Base.show` function for it. This method is called when you try to display an object. In this case, we simply print the value and unit fields of our `FloatWithUnits` struct with a space between them.\n\nNow let's test our implementation:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nwhich is exactly what we expected. Our `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` struct works correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":7.22750875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
