Note that this is not specific to the struct we defined above but should work for all such types. We could have made it more specific by replacing the abstract type in the definition of `T<:AbstractFloat` with something like `T<:Union{Float64, Float32}`, or even a concrete type like `Float64`.\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::T) where {T<:Any} # Here we use Any for the general case.\n    if fieldcount(T) == 2 && T.types[1] <: AbstractFloat && T.types[2] == String\n        print(io, getfield(x, 1), \" \", getfield(x, 2)) # Here we use getfield instead of the dot syntax to access fields in order not to be specific to our struct.\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo see that this works, let's define some values:\n\n```julia\na = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nb = FloatWithUnits(4.0, \"kilometers\")\nc = FloatWithUnits(3.6e-5, \"lightyears\")\n```\n\nand print them:\n\n```julia\nshow(a)\nshow(b)\nshow(c)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":10.948588448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
