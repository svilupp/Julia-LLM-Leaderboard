The `$(fwu.value)` expression is used to interpolate the value field of the struct into the string, and the `$(fwu.unit)` expression is used to interpolate the unit field of the struct into the string.\n\nYou can use this method like any other Julia function:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[83,232],"elapsed":5.552462869,"_type":"aimessage"}]
