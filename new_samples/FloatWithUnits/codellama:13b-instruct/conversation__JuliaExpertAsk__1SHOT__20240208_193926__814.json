The `show` method is defined as an instance method of the `FloatWithUnits` type, and it prints the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the `value` field contains a floating-point number, and the `unit` field contains a string representing the units (e.g., \"meters\" or \"kilometers\"). If your data has different types, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[122,195],"elapsed":4.746525394,"_type":"aimessage"}]
