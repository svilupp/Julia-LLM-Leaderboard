The method concatenates the value and unit with a space using the `string` function, and then prints the resulting string to the console using the `println` function.\n\nNote that we use the `Base.show` method instead of defining a custom `show` method for the struct itself. This is because the `FloatWithUnits` struct already has a pre-defined `show` method that displays its fields as a tuple. By overriding this method, we can ensure that our custom `show` method is used whenever the struct is printed.\n\nAlso note that the `string` function is used to convert the value and unit to strings before concatenating them with a space. This is because the `value` field of the struct is of type `Float64`, which cannot be directly concatenated with a string.","status":200,"tokens":[83,302],"elapsed":7.187856879,"_type":"aimessage"}]
