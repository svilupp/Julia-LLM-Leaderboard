The `struct` definition is straightforward. It has two fields, `value` and `unit`, both of type `Float64` and `String` respectively.\n2. The `show` method is defined as a function that takes two arguments: `io::IO` (the output stream) and `fwu::FloatWithUnits`. This tells Julia that the method will be called with an output stream and an instance of our struct.\n3. Inside the method, we first print the value of `fwu.value` to the output stream using `print(io, fwu.value)`.\n4. Next, we print a space character using `print(io, \" \")`.\n5. Finally, we print the unit string using `print(io, fwu.unit)`.\n\nNote that the order of these statements is important. The value should be printed first, followed by a space, and then the unit. This will give us the desired output format: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[205,304],"elapsed":7.417739721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
