The expected output should be a new DataFrame with only the rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", along with an additional column called `audi_a4_type` which is equal to `true` for all rows.\n```julia\ndf = df_cars # Original DataFrame\naudi_filter(df) # Resulting filtered DataFrame\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,453],"elapsed":13.40916081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
