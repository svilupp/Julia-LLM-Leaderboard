Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column called `audi_a4_type` that is set to `true` across all rows using indexing with `.=` operator. Finally, it returns the resulting filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":6.638686858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
