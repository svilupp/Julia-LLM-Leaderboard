[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

Then, define the `audi_filter` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is \"Audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"Audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all rows\n    df_audi[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    \n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters down the input DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"Audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it adds a new column `:audi_a4_type` to the resulting DataFrame and sets its value to `true` for all rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":8.391629266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
