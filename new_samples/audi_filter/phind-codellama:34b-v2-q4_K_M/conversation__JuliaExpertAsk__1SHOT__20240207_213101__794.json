Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    transformed_df = transform(filtered_df, :manufacturer => ByRow(x -> x == \"audi\") => :audi_a4_type)\n    return transformed_df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters down the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it uses the `transform` function from DataFrames.jl package to create a new column `:audi_a4_type`, which is set to `true` for all rows. The `ByRow(x -> x == \"audi\")` part is a broadcasted function that checks if the value in each row of the `:manufacturer` column is equal to \"audi\". This function returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,239],"elapsed":6.5257914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
