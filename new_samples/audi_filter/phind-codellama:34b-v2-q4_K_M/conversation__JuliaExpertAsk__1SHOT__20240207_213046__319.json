Here's how you could write the `audi_filter` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows\n    transform!(filtered, :audi_a4_type => (x -> true) => AsTable)\n    \n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the input DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type`, which is set to `true` for all these filtered rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[144,262],"elapsed":7.343612388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
