Then, it creates a new column `:audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all rows in this filtered DataFrame. Finally, it returns the resulting filtered and modified DataFrame.\n\nNote that you will need to have the DataFrames package installed in your Julia environment to use these functions. If you don't have it installed already, you can add it using the following command:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":8.820355128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
