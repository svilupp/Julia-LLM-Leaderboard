Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the filter function from the DataFrames.jl package to achieve this. Here is an example of how you could write your `audi_filter` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    insertcols(df_filtered, :audi_a4_type => true)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is `\"audi\"` and the model is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. Then we add a new column called `:audi_a4_type` with the value `true` in all its rows.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your DataFrame has columns named `:manufacturer`, `:model` and does not already have a column named `:audi_a4_type`. If any of these conditions are not met, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,260],"elapsed":7.378427934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
