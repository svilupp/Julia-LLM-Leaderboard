Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia using the DataFrames package to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    audi_a4 = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => x -> x ∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])\n    audi_a4.audi_a4_type .= true\n    return audi_a4\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `manufacturer` equals 'audi' and `model` is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'. It then creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` in these rows and sets it to true. This resulting DataFrame is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":5.244977275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
