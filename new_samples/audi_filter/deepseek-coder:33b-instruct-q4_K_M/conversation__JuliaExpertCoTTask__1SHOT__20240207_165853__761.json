Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that accomplishes the task as specified.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    filtered = df[ (df[:manufacturer].==\"audi\") .& ((df[:model].==\"a4\") .| (df[:model].==\"a4 quattro\")), :]\n    filtered[:,:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return filtered\nend\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n                    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nThis will filter out all rows where the manufacturer is not \"audi\" or the model is not either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column `:audi_a4_type` and sets it to `true` for all rows. This function returns this modified DataFrame. \n\nPlease note that in Julia, you need to use . before the operation if you want element-wise operations on arrays (this is called \"broadcasting\"). For example: \n```julia\ndf[:manufacturer].==\"audi\"\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```julia\n[i == \"audi\" for i in df[:manufacturer]]\n```\nThe former will be faster and more efficient when working with large DataFrames.","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":11.095457952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
