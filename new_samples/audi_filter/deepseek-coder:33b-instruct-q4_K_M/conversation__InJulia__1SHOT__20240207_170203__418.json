The filter method filters out those rows where manufacturer column has \"audi\" and model column is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". This results in a DataFrame `df_audis` that only contains rows with audi cars.\n2. The transform method adds a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered dataframe where it equals true for all rows.\n\nRemember to call this function by passing your DataFrame as an argument:\n```julia\ndf_filtered = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":8.638729857,"_type":"aimessage"}]
