Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia for the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    audi_a4 = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), df) \n    audi_a4quattro = filter(:model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), audi_a4)\n    audi_a4quattro.audi_a4_type .= true\n    return audi_a4quattro\nend\n```\nThis function first filters down the DataFrame to rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\".

Finally, a new column `audi_a4_type` is created and set to true for all remaining rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":5.508349391,"_type":"aimessage"}]
