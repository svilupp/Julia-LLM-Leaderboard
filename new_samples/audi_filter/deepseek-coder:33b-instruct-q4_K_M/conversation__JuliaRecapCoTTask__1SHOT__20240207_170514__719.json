[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

We then create a new column called `audi_a4_type` which takes the value of `true` for all rows in this filtered dataset.\n\nYou can call this function like so: \n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"mercedes\"], model=[\"a4\", \"x5\", \"s-class\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n``` \nIn this example, `filtered_df` would be a DataFrame with one row: manufacturer = `\"audi\"`, model = `\"a4\"`, and `audi_a4_type` = `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":9.175810751,"_type":"aimessage"}]
