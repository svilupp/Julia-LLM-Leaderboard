Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve this problem using Julia's DataFrames and Query packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Query\n\nfunction audi_filter(df)\n    df = @from i in df begin\n        @where i.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (i.model == \"a4\" || i.model == \"a4 quattro\")\n        @select {i..., audi_a4_type=true}\n        @collect DataFrame\n    end\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the dataframe down to only rows where the manufacturer is `audi` and the model is either `a4` or `a4 quattro`. Then it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` for all these filtered rows. Finally, it collects the result into a dataframe which it returns.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\"], model=[\"a4\", \"3-series\", \"a4 quattro\"])\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(df)\n```\nIn this example, `filtered_df` will be a DataFrame with only the rows where manufacturer is 'audi' and model is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro', with an additional column `audi_a4_type=true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.338347018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
