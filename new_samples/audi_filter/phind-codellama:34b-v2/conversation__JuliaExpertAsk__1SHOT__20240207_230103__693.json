Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could write this function in Julia using the DataFrames package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    # Filter down to Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true` across all rows\n    insertcols!(df_audi, :audi_a4_type => true)\n    \n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the input DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"Audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for each row in this filtered DataFrame. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":5.994934115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
