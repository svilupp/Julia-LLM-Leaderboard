Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the function `audi_filter`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = df_cars[(df_cars.manufacturer .== \"audi\") .& (df_cars.model .∈ [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), :]\n    insertcols!(df, :audi_a4_type => trues(nrow(df)))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the input DataFrame `df_cars` to only keep rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, it creates a new column `:audi_a4_type`, which is filled with `true` across all rows in the filtered DataFrame. The function returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the packages `DataFrames` and `CategoricalArrays` installed to run this code. If they are not installed, you can install them using the following commands:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"CategoricalArrays\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":6.99107607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
