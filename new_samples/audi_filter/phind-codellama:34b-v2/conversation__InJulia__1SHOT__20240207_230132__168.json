If it's not installed, you can add it using the following command inside your Julia REPL:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\nAfter installing the package, here is the script for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter down the dataset to only rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4” or “a4 quattro”.\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.\n    insertcols!(df_audi, :audi_a4_type => true)\n\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\n# Assuming you have a DataFrame `df_cars` with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.\ndf_result = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame, `df_result`, which contains the filtered data and the additional `audi_a4_type` column.","status":200,"tokens":[114,329],"elapsed":8.453598734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
