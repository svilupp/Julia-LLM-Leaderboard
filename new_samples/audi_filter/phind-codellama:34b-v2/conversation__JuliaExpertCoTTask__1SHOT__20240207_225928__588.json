Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, I will create the function `audi_filter` which will take a DataFrame as an input and return a new DataFrame.\n\nInside the function, I will use the `filter` function from Julia's DataFrames package to select only the rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, I will create a new column `:audi_a4_type` with a Boolean value `true` across all rows of this filtered DataFrame.\n\nFinally, the function will return the resulting filtered DataFrame with the new column added.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to only include Audi A4 and A4 Quattro models\n    filtered = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Add a new column :audi_a4_type with value true across all rows\n    filtered[!, :audi_a4_type] = trues(nrow(filtered))\n    \n    return filtered\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function on your DataFrame `df_cars` as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_result = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you the desired output. The function `audi_filter` ensures that only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\" are retained in the DataFrame, and a new column `audi_a4_type` is added with value `true` for all these rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,384],"elapsed":9.826742444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
