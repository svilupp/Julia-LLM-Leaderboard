[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`. Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then, it adds a new column `:audi_a4_type` with value `true` for all selected rows. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nPlease make sure that the DataFrames package is imported before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":6.902568085,"_type":"aimessage"}]
