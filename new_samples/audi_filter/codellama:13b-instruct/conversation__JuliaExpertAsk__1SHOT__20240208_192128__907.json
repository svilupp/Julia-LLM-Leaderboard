Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)::DataFrame\n    # filter down to only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df_filtered = @where(df_cars, :manufacturer .== \"audi\", :model .∈ (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"))\n    \n    # create new column \"audi_a4_type\" that equals true across all rows\n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = fill(true, nrow(df_filtered))\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nNote that this function uses the `@where` macro from the `DataFrames` package to filter down the dataset based on the conditions you specified. The `.==` and `.∈` operators are used to check for equality and inclusion in a vector, respectively. Finally, the `fill` function is used to create a new column with a constant value across all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[158,229],"elapsed":5.577010048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
