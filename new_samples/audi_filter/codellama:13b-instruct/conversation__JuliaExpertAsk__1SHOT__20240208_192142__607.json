Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `audi_filter` that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4 or \"a4 quattro\", then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_filtered = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"Audi\" && (row.model == \"A4\" || row.model == \"A4 Quattro\"), df_cars)\n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `filter` function is used to filter the rows of a DataFrame based on a condition. In this case, we are filtering the rows where `manufacturer` is \"Audi\" and `model` is either \"A4\" or \"A4 Quattro\".\n* The resulting filtered DataFrame is assigned to `df_filtered`.\n* A new column `audi_a4_type` is created in `df_filtered` with the value `true` for all rows. This is done using the `:[]` syntax, which allows us to assign values to a column based on a condition. In this case, we are setting the value of `audi_a4_type` to `true` for all rows where the condition is met.\n* The resulting filtered and modified DataFrame is returned from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[158,339],"elapsed":8.237057316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
