Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you could implement this function using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    md_parsed = MD(md)\n    jl_code = \"\"\n    \n    for element in md_parsed.content\n        if typeof(element) == Code\n            code_text = element.code\n            # Checking whether the language specified is Julia\n            if haskey(element.language, \"name\") && element.language[\"name\"] == \"julia\"\n                jl_code *= code_text * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return jl_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package from Julia's ecosystem to parse the provided markdown document. It then iterates over all elements in the parsed document and checks whether an element is a code block. If it is, the function verifies if the specified language for that code block is Julia. If yes, the function appends the content of the code block to `jl_code` with a newline character. Finally, it returns the accumulated string of all Julia code found in code blocks in the markdown document.\n\nRemember to add `using Markdown` at the beginning of your script to use this function. If you don't have the Markdown package installed yet, you can install it using the package manager by typing `]add Markdown` in the REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[0,334],"elapsed":8.458182472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
