Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    inside_code_block = false\n    code = \"\"\n\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if inside_code_block\n                push!(code_blocks, code)\n                code = \"\"\n            end\n            inside_code_block = !inside_code_block\n        elseif inside_code_block\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    if !isempty(code)\n        push!(code_blocks, code)\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```\", it toggles `inside_code_block`. If it is inside a code block, it appends the current line to `code` with a newline character. Once it has processed all lines in the document, it pushes the remaining `code` (if any) to `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all code blocks in `code_blocks` with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":7.799842797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
