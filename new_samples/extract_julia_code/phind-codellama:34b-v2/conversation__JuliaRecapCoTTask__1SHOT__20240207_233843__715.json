[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` can be implemented using Regular Expressions to identify the code blocks and replace them with just their content. Here is a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Convert markdown document into a markdown object\n    md_obj = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks and join them with a newline\n    return join(map(x -> x.content, filter(x -> isa(x, Markdown.Code), md_obj.content)), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first converts the markdown document into a `Markdown` object using `Markdown.parse`. Then it filters out all elements that are not of type `Markdown.Code`, which represent code blocks in the parsed markdown. The `content` field of each `Markdown.Code` object is then extracted and joined together with a newline character to form the final result.\n\nNote: The function `Markdown.parse` comes from the `Markdown` standard library, which is included in Julia's base installation.","status":200,"tokens":[13,259],"elapsed":6.782981316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
