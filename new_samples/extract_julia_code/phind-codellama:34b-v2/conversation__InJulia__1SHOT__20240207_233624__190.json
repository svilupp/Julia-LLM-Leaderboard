Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here's how you might define `extract_julia_code` function:\n\nFirstly, make sure you have installed the LightXML package using this command in your julia REPL:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"LightXML\")\n```\n\nThen, use the following code to define the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing LightXML\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    xdoc = parse_string(md)\n    xroot = root(xdoc)\n    code_blocks = find_elements(xroot, \"pre\") # assuming code blocks are within <pre> tags\n    code = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        # Check if the code block is julia code by verifying if it has a 'language-julia' attribute\n        lang = attribute(block, \"class\")\n        if lang != nothing && occursin(\"language-julia\", lang)\n            content = strip(content(block))  # remove leading/trailing spaces\n            code *= \"$content\\n\"             # append with a newline\n        end\n    end\n    free(xdoc)  # don't forget to free the document to avoid memory leaks\n    return code[1:end-1]  # return without the trailing newline\nend\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that julia code blocks are enclosed in `<pre>` tags with `class=\"language-julia\"`. This is how code blocks are usually represented in markdown files. If your input format differs, you might need to adjust the tag and/or attribute names accordingly.\n\nThis implementation will extract and concatenate all julia code blocks from a given markdown document. The result will be a single string with newline-separated lines of code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,437],"elapsed":11.066324404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
