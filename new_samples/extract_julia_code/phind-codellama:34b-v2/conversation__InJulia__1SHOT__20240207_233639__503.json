This function uses a regular expression to match julia language code blocks, removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular Expression pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.|\\n)*?```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n\n    # Extract and join all julia code blocks with a newline\n    jl_code = map(m -> strip(m.match, ['`', '\\n']), matches)\n    \n    return join(jl_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function requires the `Markdown` package to work properly as it relies on the syntax for julia code blocks (enclosed in triple backticks) which is a markdown feature.\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function accepts a string representing a markdown document as input, and returns a string containing all the extracted julia code without code fences and joined with newline characters. If there are no matches for the regular expression pattern, it will return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":7.557064432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
