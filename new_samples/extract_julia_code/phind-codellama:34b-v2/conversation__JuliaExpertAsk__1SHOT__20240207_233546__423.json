Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do what you described:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern to match julia code blocks (enclosed by ```julia...)\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = findall(pattern, md, Multiline(true))\n    \n    # Extract and join the matched code blocks with a newline character\n    return join((md[match] for match in matches), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses Julia's regex engine to search the markdown document for all instances of julia code blocks (enclosed by ```julia at the start and ``` at the end). It then extracts these code blocks, removes the ```julia and ``` markers, and joins them together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":5.420041079,"_type":"aimessage"}]
