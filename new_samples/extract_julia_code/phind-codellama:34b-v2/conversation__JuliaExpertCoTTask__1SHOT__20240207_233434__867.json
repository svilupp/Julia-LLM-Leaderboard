[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nYou can use the Julia package `CodecZlib` to decompress the data. Here's how you can implement the function:\n\nFirst, let's create a helper function to remove code fences from the extracted code block.\n\n```julia\nfunction remove_code_fence(code::String)\n    lines = split(code, \"\\n\")\n    filtered_lines = filter(line -> !startswith(line, \"```\"), lines)\n    return join(filtered_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow let's implement the main function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n.*?\\n```\"ms, md)  # 'ms' flag is for multiline matching\n    codes = map(code_blocks) do block\n        remove_code_fence(block.match)\n    end\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match all Julia code blocks and removes the code fences using the helper function. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,275],"elapsed":6.961243616,"_type":"aimessage"}]
