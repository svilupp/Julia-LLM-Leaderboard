Then it joins all the code blocks using a newline character and returns the final string. If no julia code blocks were found in the document, it returns an empty string.\n\nPlease note that the Markdown package needs to be installed. You can install it by running `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Markdown\")`. The CodecLz4 package is used for decompression and also needs to be installed with `import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"CodecLz4\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":10.426090004,"_type":"aimessage"}]
