[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here is a function that should accomplish what you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Convert markdown to an AbstractBlock element\n    blocks = Markdown.parse(md).content\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted Julia code\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over all elements in the parsed markdown\n    for block in blocks\n        if isa(block, Markdown.Code)  # If the element is a code block\n            lang, code = block.language, block.code\n            \n            if isnothing(lang) || lowercase(lang) == \"julia\"  # If the code block is Julia code\n                julia_code *= code * \"\\n\"  # Append it to the stored Julia code\n            end\n        elseif isa(block, Markdown.MD) && !isempty(block.content)\n            # If the element is a nested markdown, recursively process it\n            julia_code *= extract_jul       \n```  \n\nThis function works by parsing the provided `md` markdown document into an array of blocks representing its structure. It then iterates over each block and checks if it's a code block. If it is, the function checks if the language for that code block is Julia (if specified). If so, or if no language is specified, the function appends the code in that block to `julia_code`. If the element is a nested markdown, the function calls itself recursively on that element.\n\nThe resulting `julia_code` string will contain all Julia code from code blocks in the document, with each code block separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":10.560689457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
