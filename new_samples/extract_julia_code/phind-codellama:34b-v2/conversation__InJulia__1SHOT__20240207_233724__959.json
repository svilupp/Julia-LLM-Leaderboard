Parse the provided markdown document with `Markdown.parse(md)`. This returns a Markdown object containing all the content of the document, including text and code blocks.\n2. Iterate over each element in the Markdown object. If the current element is a code block (`isa(element, Markdown.Code)`) and its language is julia (or unspecified), add the code to the `code_blocks` array using `push!`.\n3. After all elements have been processed, join the contents of `code_blocks` into a single string with newline characters between each block using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")`. This ensures that all the extracted Julia code blocks are combined into one continuous block of code, separated by newlines where necessary.\n4. Return the final joined string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,324],"elapsed":8.207652123,"_type":"aimessage"}]
