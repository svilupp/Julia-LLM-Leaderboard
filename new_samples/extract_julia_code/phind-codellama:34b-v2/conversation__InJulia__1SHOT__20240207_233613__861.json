[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all matches of this pattern in the input string. Finally, the captured code blocks are concatenated together and returned as a single string. Note that the `[\\s\\S]*?` pattern is used to match any character, including newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":8.326109835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
