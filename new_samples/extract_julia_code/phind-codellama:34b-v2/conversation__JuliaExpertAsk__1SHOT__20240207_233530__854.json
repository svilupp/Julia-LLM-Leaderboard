Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using Julia's built-in regular expression functionality:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"sm\n\n    # Vector to store all the code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Iterate over each match\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        push!(code_blocks, replace(match.captures[1], r\"\\n?\" => \"\"))\n    end\n\n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression pattern to match julia code blocks. It then uses `eachmatch` to iterate over each match in the provided markdown string. The contents of each code block are captured and added to the `code_blocks` vector. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with newline characters between them and returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":6.173468314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
