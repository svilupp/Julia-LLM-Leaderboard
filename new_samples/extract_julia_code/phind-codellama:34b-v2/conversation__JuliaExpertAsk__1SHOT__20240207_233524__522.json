Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way to solve this problem using Julia's built-in Regular Expression (Regex) functionality:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for ```julia ... ``` code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(?:[^`]|\\n)+?```\"\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n\n    # Extract the matched code blocks, removing ```julia and ```\n    code_blocks = [replace(match.match, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\") for match in matches]\n    code_blocks = [replace(code, \"\\n```\" => \"\") for code in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match ```julia code blocks```. Then it extracts each matched block, removing the starting and ending fences. Finally, it joins all the extracted code blocks with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":6.749431724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
