It iterates over each token and checks if its type is `Markdown.Code`. If it is, the code block is pushed onto the `code_blocks` array. Finally, all the code blocks are joined together with a newline character in between.\n\nPlease note that you should have `using Markdown` at the start of your script to use the `Markdown.tokenize` function.\n\nAlso remember to include the triple backticks (```) before and after the julia code block in your markdown document, which is the convention for marking Julia code blocks in a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":6.722181486,"_type":"aimessage"}]
