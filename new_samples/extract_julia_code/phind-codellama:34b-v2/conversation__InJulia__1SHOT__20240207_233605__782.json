[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It then finds all instances of this pattern in the input markdown string `md`. After extracting each match, it removes the starting and ending tags of the code block (i.e., \"```julia\" and \"``). Finally, it joins all the extracted code together with a newline character and returns the result as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[91,321],"elapsed":8.28983643,"_type":"aimessage"}]
