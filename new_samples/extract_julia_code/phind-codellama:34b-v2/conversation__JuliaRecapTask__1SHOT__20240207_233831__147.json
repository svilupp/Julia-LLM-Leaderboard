[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We can use regular expressions to achieve this in Julia. Here's a function that does it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    md_parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the Julia code\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through all elements in the parsed markdown\n    for el in md_parsed.content\n        # If the element is a code block\n        if typeof(el) == Markdown.Code\n            # Remove the language identifier (first line), if present\n            code = split(el.code, '\\n', limit=2)[end]\n            \n            # Append the code to the Julia code string\n            julia_code *= code * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown` package from Julia's ecosystem to parse the input markdown document. It then iterates through all elements in the parsed structure, and if it encounters a code block, it removes the language identifier (first line) and appends the rest of the code to the final result string.\n\nThe final result is a single string containing all Julia code blocks from the input markdown document, separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":8.762582894,"_type":"aimessage"}]
