[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md)  # use non-greedy match for code blocks\n    return join([replace(code, r\"^`{3}julia\\n\" => \"\").strip() for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks in the provided markdown document. The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all non-overlapping matches of the given pattern in the string, and we use the non-greedy match (`.+?`) to capture as little text as possible between the start and end code fences.\n\nThe replace function removes the \"```julia\" and the newline that follows it from each captured code block, and `strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The result is a vector of strings, which are then joined together with a newline character between each element using the `join` function.\n\nThis implementation assumes that there are no nested code blocks and that all code blocks are properly closed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":6.599721698,"_type":"aimessage"}]
