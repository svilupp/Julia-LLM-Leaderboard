Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Regular Expressions to match the Julia code blocks in the markdown document which are typically enclosed by triple backticks (```) followed by optional \"julia\" keyword and then closed by three backticks again.
