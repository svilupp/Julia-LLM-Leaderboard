[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use Regular Expressions to match the code fences and their contents in the markdown document. Then, replace them with just the code block content, separated by newlines.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing RegexTools: @rreplace\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match anything between triple backticks and remove the backticks\n    # ```some code``` -> some code\\n\n    @rreplace md r\"```(\\w*)\\n?([\\s\\S]*?)```\" s\"\\2\\n\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use `@rreplace` from the `RegexTools` package to replace all occurrences of the matched regex pattern with the specified replacement. The regex pattern matches triple backticks followed by any number of word characters (for optional language specification), a newline (optional), the content of the code block and another set of triple backticks.\n\nWe then replace these matches with just the content of the code block, followed by a newline. This way, if there are multiple code blocks in the input, they will all be joined together in the output, separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.191616988,"_type":"aimessage"}]
