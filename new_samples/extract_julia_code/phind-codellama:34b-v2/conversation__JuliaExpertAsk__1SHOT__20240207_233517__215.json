Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following is an implementation of the function to extract Julia code from a markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression for julia language code blocks\n    codeblock_pattern = r\"^```.*?\\n([^`]*)\\n.*?```$\"ms\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(codeblock_pattern, md))\n    \n    # Extract julia code from the matches and join them together with a newline\n    return join([m.captures[1] for m in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match Julia language code blocks enclosed by triple backticks (```) and extracts the code within those blocks. The `ms` flags are used for this regex: `m` treats the string as multiline, allowing `^` and `$` to match the start and end of lines, respectively; `s` allows `.` to match any character including a newline.\n\nIt then collects all matches into a vector, extracts the captured code from each match, and joins them together with a newline character. This joined string is then returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":7.120094666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
