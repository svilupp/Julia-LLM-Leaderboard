[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    for block in md.code\n        if block.language == \"julia\"\n            code *= block.content * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. We use the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract all the code blocks.\n2. We iterate over each code block and check if its language is \"julia\". If it is, we add its content to a string called `code`.\n3. We return the joined code string after adding a newline between each block.\n\nNote: The `Markdown` package does not have a built-in function for extracting Julia code blocks, so we need to iterate over all the code blocks and check their language manually.","status":200,"tokens":[400,203],"elapsed":5.361489789,"_type":"aimessage"}]
