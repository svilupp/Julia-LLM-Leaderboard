It then iterates over each block, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the content of the block, and appends it to a string called `code` with a newline character `\\n` at the end. Finally, it returns the resulting code string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown document is well-formed and contains only valid Julia code blocks. If the document contains any other types of blocks or invalid code, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[97,241],"elapsed":5.803551216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
