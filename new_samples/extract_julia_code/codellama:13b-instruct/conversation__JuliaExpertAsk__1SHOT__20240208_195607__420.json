Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Split the markdown string into individual code blocks\n    blocks = split(md, r\"^```julia\", keepempty=false)\n    \n    # Extract each code block and remove the code fences\n    extracted = map(blocks) do block\n        strip(block[2:end])\n    end\n    \n    # Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline\n    join(extracted, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first splits the markdown string into individual code blocks using the `split` function. Then it extracts each code block and removes the code fences by using the `strip` function. Finally, it joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[135,200],"elapsed":4.944203241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
