The `eachmatch` function is used to iterate over all the matches and extract the contents of each code block. The `captures` field of the `block` object contains an array with the captured groups from the regular expression, where the first element is the entire match and subsequent elements are the captures for each group in the pattern. In this case, we're only interested in the first capture, which is the code block content. The `*?` quantifier is used to make the match non-greedy, so that it matches as few characters as possible until the next occurrence of ```julia`.\n\nThe resulting code is then joined together with a newline character using the `join` function.\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    return join(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, 1).captures[1], \"\\n\")\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,300],"elapsed":7.167146953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
