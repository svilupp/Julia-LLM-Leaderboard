Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Split the markdown document into an array of lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    # Create an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n    # Loop through each line and check if it contains a code block\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            # If it does, add the code block to the output string\n            code *= strip_code_fences(line) * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    # Return the extracted code as a String\n    return code\nend\n\n# Helper function to remove code fences from a line of markdown\nfunction strip_code_fences(line)\n    # Remove the starting and ending code fence characters\n    return replace(line, r\"```\" => \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes a string argument `md` which represents the markdown document. It first splits the document into an array of lines using the `split` function from Julia's standard library. Then it creates an empty string `code` to store the extracted code blocks. Next, it loops through each line in the array and checks if it contains a code block by looking for the starting code fence character (````julia`). If a code block is found, it adds the stripped code block (without the code fences) to the output string `code` using the `strip_code_fences` function. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a String.\n\nNote that the `replace` function is used in the `strip_code_fences` function to remove the starting and ending code fence characters from each line of markdown.","status":200,"tokens":[229,403],"elapsed":9.847424286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
