Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document and joins them together with newlines:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together\n    return replace(md, r\"^```\\w*\\n([\\s\\S]*?)```\", s\"\\1\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all instances of Julia code fences (i.e., lines that start with `````) and replaces them with the contents of the code block (i.e., the text between the fence and the next occurrence of the same fence). The `replace` function is used to make this substitution in-place, without creating a new string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks, and it will not work correctly if there are any instances of Julia code fences inside other code blocks. If you need to handle nested code blocks, you may need to modify the regular expression or use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[135,232],"elapsed":5.675024188,"_type":"aimessage"}]
