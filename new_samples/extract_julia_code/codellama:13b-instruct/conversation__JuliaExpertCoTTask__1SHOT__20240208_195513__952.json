[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The provided markdown document `md` has the following code block:\n```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\nTo extract this code block, we can use the `code_blocks` function from the `JuliaMarkdown` package. This function returns an array of code blocks in the Markdown document. We can then use a loop to iterate over each code block and remove the code fences (the ``` symbols) and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n```julia\nusing JuliaMarkdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = JuliaMarkdown.code_blocks(md)\n    output = \"\"\n    for block in code_blocks\n        block = replace(block, \"```\" => \"\")\n        output *= block * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\nThe `replace` function is used to remove the code fences from each code block. The `*` operator is used to concatenate the code blocks together with a newline character between them. Finally, the resulting string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[229,244],"elapsed":6.06254076,"_type":"aimessage"}]
