Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task is to extract the Julia code from a Markdown document. The function `extract_julia_code` should take in a string containing the Markdown document, remove any code fences (``` ```) and join the extracted code blocks together with a newline.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Start by defining the function `extract_julia_code` that takes in a string containing the Markdown document as an argument.\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # your code here\nend\n```\n2. Use regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the Markdown document. A Julia code block is enclosed by triple backticks (` ``` `) and can span multiple lines.\n```julia\n# define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\ncode_block_regex = r\"```\\s*julia([^`]*)```\"\n\n# find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the Markdown document\nmatches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n```\n3. Iterate over each match and extract the Julia code block. You can use `captures(m)` to get the captured groups from the regular expression.\n```julia\n# iterate over each match and extract the Julia code block\nfor m in matches\n    code_block = captures(m)[1]\n    # your code here\nend\n```\n4. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted code blocks.\n```julia\ncode_block = strip(code_block)\n```\n5. Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline.\n```julia\n# join the extracted code blocks together with a newline\njoined_code = join([code_block for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n```\n6. Return the joined code as a string.\n```julia\nreturn joined_code\n```\nHere's the final code:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # define a regular expression to match Julia code blocks\n    code_block_regex = r\"```\\s*julia([^`]*)```\"\n\n    # find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the Markdown document\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # iterate over each match and extract the Julia code block\n    for m in matches\n        code_block = captures(m)[1]\n        code_block = strip(code_block)\n        joined_code = join([code_block for m in matches], \"\\n\")\n        return joined_code\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[229,607],"elapsed":14.713814427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
