[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This task can be solved using the following Julia syntax:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Extract all code blocks from the markdown document `md`\n    codeblocks = md |> findall(\"{code}\")\n\n    # Remove code fences from each code block and join them together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce(join, map(x -> x[2:end - 1], codeblocks))\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nExplanation of the function:\n\n* `findall(\"{code}\"` searches for all instances of `{code}` in the markdown document and returns a list of their positions. This is the starting point for extracting code blocks from the markdown file.\n* We use `map(x -> x[2:end - 1], codeblocks)` to remove the `{code}` fences from each code block. The resulting list of strings contains only the code inside the code blocks.\n* `reduce(join, ...)` joins all the code blocks together with a newline character `\\n`.\n* Finally, we return the joined string as the final output of the function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in the markdown document. If there are nested code blocks, the function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[400,297],"elapsed":7.579524661,"_type":"aimessage"}]
