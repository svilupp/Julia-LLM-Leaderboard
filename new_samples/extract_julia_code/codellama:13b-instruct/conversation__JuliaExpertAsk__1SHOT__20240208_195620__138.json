Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    fenced_code_started = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && !fenced_code_started\n            fenced_code_started = true\n            continue\n        end\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && fenced_code_started\n            fenced_code_started = false\n            continue\n        end\n        if fenced_code_started\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each line of the `md` string using `eachline`, and checks whether the current line starts with a code fence. If it does, then it sets a flag `fenced_code_started` to true, and continues to the next line.\n\nIf the current line doesn't start with a code fence, but the flag is set to true, then it pushes the current line to an array of code blocks `code_blocks`.\n\nOnce the function reaches the end of the `md` string, it returns the joined code blocks as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[135,305],"elapsed":7.356552595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
