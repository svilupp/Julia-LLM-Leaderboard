If a line starts with `\"```julia\"`, it is considered a code block and is appended to the `codeblocks` list. Finally, the function returns a string containing all the extracted code blocks joined together with newlines.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a Julia Markdown document\n\nHere's some Julia code:\n```julia\nx = 1 + 2\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nAnd here's some more code:\n```julia\ny = \"Hello, world!\"\nprintln(y)\n```\n\"\"\"\n\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprint(code)\n```\nThis will output the following string:\n```\nx = 1 + 2\nprintln(x)\ny = \"Hello, world!\"\nprintln(y)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,337],"elapsed":8.038113699,"_type":"aimessage"}]
