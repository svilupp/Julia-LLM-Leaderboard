[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Extract all code blocks from the markdown document\n    codeblocks = eachmatch(r\"^```julia([\\s\\S]+?)```\", md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    result = \"\"\n    for codeblock in codeblocks\n        # Remove the leading ```julia and trailing ```\n        codeblock = replace(codeblock, r\"^```julia|```$\", \"\")\n        \n        # Add a newline before each code block except the first one\n        if result != \"\"\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        \n        # Append the code block to the result\n        result *= codeblock\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `eachmatch` function is used to extract all occurrences of a regular expression in a string. In this case, we use it to find all code blocks in the markdown document.\n2. We then remove the leading and trailing ```julia and ``` from each code block using the `replace` function.\n3. If the result is not empty (i.e., if there are multiple code blocks), we add a newline before each code block except the first one, which already has a newline at the end of the previous block.\n4. Finally, we join all the code blocks together using the `*` operator, and return the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[397,349],"elapsed":8.874129232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
