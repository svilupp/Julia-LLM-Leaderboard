If it does, it appends the value of the block (i.e., the code itself) to an array called `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with newline characters and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` object is a Markdown document with Julia language code blocks. If the input is not in the correct format, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[97,220],"elapsed":5.297695528,"_type":"aimessage"}]
