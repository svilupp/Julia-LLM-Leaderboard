[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'm glad you provided me with the special instructions for this task. Based on your requirements, I will use the following Julia code snippet to extract all the code blocks from a Markdown document `md`:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regex to find all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md))\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline and return as a String\n    return join([code for code in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the Markdown document. It then joins all the code blocks together using a newline character, and returns the resulting string.\n\nI hope this solution meets your requirements!","status":200,"tokens":[400,187],"elapsed":4.980561812,"_type":"aimessage"}]
