[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can solve the problem in Julia. I am assuming that you want to extract code blocks that start with ```julia and end with ```. If it's different, please clarify.\n\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String) \n    julia_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")[2:end]\n    code_strings = [split(block, \"```\")[1] for block in julia_blocks]\n    return join(code_strings, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first break the markdown into blocks where each starts with ```julia. We then split these blocks again to get rid of the trailing code fence and extract the actual code inside it. The result is an array of Strings where each String is a block of Julia code. Finally, we join all this code together into one string, separating the blocks by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[212,214],"elapsed":6.309088428,"_type":"aimessage"}]
