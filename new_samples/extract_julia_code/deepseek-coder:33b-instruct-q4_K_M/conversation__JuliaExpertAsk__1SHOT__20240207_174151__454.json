Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to find the Julia code blocks in the markdown document. Here is a simple function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks\n    julia_blocks = eachmatch(r\"^```julia\\n(.*?)^```\", md, s)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join([block.captures[1] for block in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by using Julia's `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the regular expression \"^```julia\\\\n(.*?)^```\" in the input string `md`. The regular expression is looking for code blocks that start with a \"```julia\" line and end with a \"```\" line, capturing everything in between as a group. \n\nThe function then joins all of these captured groups together into a single string, separating each block by a newline. If there are multiple Julia code blocks in the markdown document, they will be separated by a newline in the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[120,262],"elapsed":7.556161989,"_type":"aimessage"}]
