Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following is an example of how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_blocks = filter(!isempty, split(replace(md, r\"```julia\" => \"\\n```julia\", r\"```$\" => \"\"), r\"\\n+\")) do block\n        startswith(block, \"```julia\") && occursin(\"```\", block)\n    end\n    julia_code = replace.(julia_blocks, Ref(r\"```julia\\s*|\\n```$\" => \"\"))\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the input string `md` into blocks based on newline characters. It then filters out any blocks that do not start with \"```julia\" or end with \"```\". The remaining blocks are then joined together with a double newline character to create a single string, and this string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,235],"elapsed":6.640440413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
