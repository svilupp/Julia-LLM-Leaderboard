If a line starts with `\"```julia\"` or `\"```\"`, it's considered to be the start of a Julia code block. The function then searches for the end of the block (identified by another \"```\") and appends all lines in between to `julia_blocks`. Finally, it joins all blocks together with newlines into a single string. Note that `reverse(julia_blocks)` is used because we are scanning from the top down, but Julia code is usually executed from top to bottom.","status":200,"tokens":[0,330],"elapsed":9.328467332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
