Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve it in Julia. The function `extract_julia_code` uses regular expressions to find all markdown code blocks and extract the julia codes within them, then join these codes together with newline character(s). Note that the code block should start with three backticks (```) or tilde (~~~) and end with another group of three backticks or tilde. The language identifier is optional and if provided it should be \"julia\".\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_regex = r\"((`{3,}|~{3,})\\s*(\\w*)\\n)(?<codes>(.|\\n)*?)(\\k'codes'\\n)(\\k'codes')\"\n    match_all = eachmatch(julia_regex, md)\n    \n    julia_code_blocks = [m.captures[5] for m in match_all if isempty(m.captures[3]) || lowercase(m.captures[3]) == \"julia\"]\n    \n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nIn this code:\n\n- `md` is the markdown document string.\n- `julia_regex` is a regular expression that matches markdown code blocks with julia codes. \n- `match_all` finds all matches of `julia_regex` in `md`.\n- The list comprehension iterates over each match, checks if the language identifier (if provided) is \"julia\", and if so, adds the matched code block to `julia_code_blocks`.\n- Finally, the function joins all julia code blocks together with newline character(s).","status":200,"tokens":[0,406],"elapsed":11.519004001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
