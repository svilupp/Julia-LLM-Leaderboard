[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to find and extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document. Here's how you could do this in a function named `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex \n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, overlap=true)\n    code = join([m.captures[1] for m in julia_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return replace(code, \"\\\\n\" => \"\\n\") # Replace escaped newlines with actual newlines\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all instances of Julia code blocks within the markdown document. The regular expression pattern used is `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` which matches any text that is between two sets of triple backticks, where there are a newline following \"```julia\", another newline after some code, and another set of triple backticks. The captured group (i.e., the actual Julia code) is then joined together with newlines using `join`.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle inline code blocks or code blocks spanning multiple lines without explicit line breaks, nor it handles escaped newlines in the code block content. For more robust parsing of markdown files containing julia code, you might want to consider a full-fledged markdown parser library.","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":9.641225858,"_type":"aimessage"}]
