Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can define this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    codeblock_started = false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            codeblock_started = true\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && codeblock_started\n            julia_code *= \"\\n\"\n            codeblock_started = false\n        elseif codeblock_started\n            julia_code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines, then checking each line to see if it is a start or end of a Julia code block. If a start marker (\"```julia\") is found, `codeblock_started` is set to true, and any following lines are considered part of a code block until an end marker (\"```\") is found, at which point `codeblock_started` is set back to false. The lines within these blocks are added to `julia_code` with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.924638293,"_type":"aimessage"}]
