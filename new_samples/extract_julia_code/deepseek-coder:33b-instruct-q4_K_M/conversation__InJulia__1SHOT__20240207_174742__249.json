It maintains a flag `in_block` which is true if we are currently inside a Julia code block and false otherwise. For each line, if it's a fenced code start/end marker, it checks whether the language is \"julia\" or not. If it is, it toggles the `in_block` flag; for other languages, it keeps the line (to preserve code fences). If it's inside a Julia block and not a fence, it adds the line to the list of code lines. Finally, it joins all the code lines together with newlines and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":10.755705841,"_type":"aimessage"}]
