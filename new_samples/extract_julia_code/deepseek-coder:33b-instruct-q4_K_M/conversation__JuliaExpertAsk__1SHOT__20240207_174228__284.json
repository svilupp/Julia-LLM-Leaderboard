Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    julia_lines = String[]\n    is_in_fence = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # If we find a code fence\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```\")\n            is_in_fence = !is_in_fence\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we're in a code block\n        if is_in_fence\n            push_if_not_empty(julia_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_lines, '\\n')\nend\n\nfunction push_if_not_empty(arr::Vector{String}, str::String)\n    if !isempty(str)\n        push_if_not_empty(arr, chomp(str))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input markdown document into lines and then checks each line. If it finds a code fence (either ```julia` or ```), it flips a boolean flag indicating whether we are in a Julia code block or not. If we are in a code block, the function adds the line to an array of code lines, excluding any trailing newline characters. Finally, it joins all these lines into one string with newlines between them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":10.395490635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
