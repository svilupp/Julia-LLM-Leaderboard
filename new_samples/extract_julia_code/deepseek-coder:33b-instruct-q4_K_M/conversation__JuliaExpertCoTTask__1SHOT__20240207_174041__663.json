It then iterates over these lines and checks if they start with or end with a code fence (`\"\"\"`) and whether they are Julia code blocks by checking for `\"```julia\"` at the end of the line. If it finds a starting fence, it sets the flag `in_block` to true, if it finds an ending fence, it sets `in_block` back to false. If it's in a block and the current line isn't a code fence, it adds the line to the `julia_lines` array. Finally, it joins all these lines together with newlines and returns this as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,468],"elapsed":13.381949501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
