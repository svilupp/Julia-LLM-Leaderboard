Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function `extract_julia_code` which solves the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_code = replace(md, r\"^```julia\\s+(.+?)\\s+```$\"ms => s\"\\1\")\n    return join(split(julia_code, \"\\n\"), \"\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using `replace` to remove code fences. It does this by using a regular expression that matches the pattern of a code block in markdown syntax (which is `\"```julia ... ```\"`) and captures the content between the fences as a group (denoted by the parentheses). The captured group is then inserted into the string where it was matched, effectively removing the code fences.\n\nNext, it joins all the lines of the resultant String with newline characters removed using `join` and `split`. This ensures that multiple code blocks are correctly joined together with a newline character in between.\n\nFinally, the function returns this modified String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":7.12850002,"_type":"aimessage"}]
