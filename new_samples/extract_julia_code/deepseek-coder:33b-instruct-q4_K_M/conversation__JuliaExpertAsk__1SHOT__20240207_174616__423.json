Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's regular expressions package `Regex` to find markdown code blocks. \n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_regex = r\"```julia\\n((.|\\n)*?)\\n```\"\n    matches = match.(julia_regex, md)\n    code = [m[1] for m in matches if !isnothing(m)]\n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first finding all the markdown code blocks with a language of `julia`. It then extracts the code inside these blocks and joins them together with newlines. Note that this function assumes that there is exactly one opening ```julia` and one closing ``` for each block, and that no nested code blocks are used. If your markdown contains more complex structures, you may need a more sophisticated parser.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":5.963932476,"_type":"aimessage"}]
