The function `extract_julia_code` will accept a string containing a markdown document and return all the Julia code blocks concatenated together with new lines.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_blocks = filter(!isempty, split(md, \"\\n\\n\")) do block\n        startswith(block, \"```julia\") || startswith(block, \"```{julia}\")\n    end\n    return join([join(split(block[10:end-4], \"\\n\"), \"\\n\") for block in julia_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into blocks separated by two newlines (`\"\\n\\n\"`). Then it filters out those blocks that start with either \"```julia\" or \"```{julia}\". These are the Julia code block markers in markdown. Finally, it joins all these code blocks together with a newline (`\"\\n\"`) to create the final string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":7.373991662,"_type":"aimessage"}]
