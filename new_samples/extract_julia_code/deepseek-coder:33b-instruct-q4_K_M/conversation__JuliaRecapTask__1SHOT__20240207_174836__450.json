[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document and removes the fences. It assumes that every code block in the markdown uses the backticks syntax (`` ` ``). \n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    codeblocks = String[]\n    isblock = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            isblock = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && isblock\n            isblock = false\n        end\n        \n        if isblock\n            pushfirst(codeblocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(reverse(codeblocks), '\\n')\nend\n```\nThe function splits the markdown document into lines. It then loops over each line in the document and checks if it starts with \"```julia\". If it does, it sets a flag `isblock` to true and continues to the next line. If it starts with \"```\" and `isblock` is true, it sets `isblock` back to false.\n\nIf `isblock` is true at any point, the function appends the current line (after trimming leading/trailing white spaces) to an array of code blocks. \n\nFinally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result as a string. Note that it reverses the order of the codeblocks because we collect them in reverse order. This is done because Julia arrays are indexed from the end when you use `pushfirst`, which means that the last block found will be the first one added to the array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":11.367481288,"_type":"aimessage"}]
