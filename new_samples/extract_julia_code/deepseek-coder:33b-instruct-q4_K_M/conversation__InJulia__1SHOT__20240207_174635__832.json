If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia` or ` ``` `, it sets a flag (`code_block = true`) which means we are inside a code block. If the line starts with ` ``` ` or ```julia` again, this signals the end of a code block and we set `code_block = false`.\n\nIf we're inside a code block (checked by `if code_block`), we add the line to our list of Julia code blocks using `pushfirst(julia_blocks, line)`.\n\nFinally, after all lines have been processed, it joins all remaining code blocks together with a newline character (`'\\n'`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":10.123872343,"_type":"aimessage"}]
