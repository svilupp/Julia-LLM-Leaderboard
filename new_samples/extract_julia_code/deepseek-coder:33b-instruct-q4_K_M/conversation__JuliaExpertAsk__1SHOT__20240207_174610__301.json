Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    codeblocks = []\n    insideblock = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            pushfirst(codeblocks, \"\")\n            insideblock = !insideblock\n        elseif insideblock\n            codeblocks[1] *= string(line, '\\n')\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join([cb for cb in reverse(codeblocks)], \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document into lines and then iterating over each line. When it finds a line that starts and ends with \"```\", it toggles whether or not it's inside a code block (`insideblock`). If it's inside a block, it appends the line to the current code block. If it's outside a block, it creates a new code block. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a double newline separator and returns the result as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":7.521362357,"_type":"aimessage"}]
