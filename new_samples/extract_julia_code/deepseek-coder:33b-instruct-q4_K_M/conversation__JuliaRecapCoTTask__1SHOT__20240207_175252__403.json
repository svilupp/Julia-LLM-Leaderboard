[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can approach this problem using Python's regular expressions module `re`:\n\n```python\nimport re\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown text\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'(?<=```julia)[.\\n]*?(?=```)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n```\nThis function first identifies all the sections of text that are wrapped in ```julia and ``` using regular expressions, which is a powerful tool for searching strings. The `re.findall` function returns all matches to this pattern in the input string `md` as a list of strings. \n\nEach match is then joined together with newline characters ('\\n') into one long string that represents all the code blocks in the markdown document, which is returned by the function. The 'DOTALL' flag ensures that the dot ('.') character matches any character including newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":7.050704316,"_type":"aimessage"}]
