[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    in_fence = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_fence = true\n            continue\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && in_fence\n            in_fence = false\n        end\n        \n        if in_fence\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return rstrip(code)  # Remove trailing newline\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input string. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it sets `in_fence` to true and skips the rest of the loop, effectively starting a code block. If it encounters a line that ends with \"```\" while `in_fence` is true, it sets `in_fence` back to false and skips the rest of the loop, effectively ending a code block. While inside a code block (i.e., `in_fence` is true), it appends each line of the code block to the `code` string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":8.729958896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
