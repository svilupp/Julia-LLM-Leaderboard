[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    julia_lines = String[]\n    is_in_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            is_in_block = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && is_in_block\n            is_in_block = false\n        elseif is_in_block\n            pushfirst(julia_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the input string and checking if it's part of a Julia code block. If it is, the line is added to `julia_lines` which will be joined into a single string with newline characters in between each line. Note that this script assumes that all lines within a code block are Julia code and does not check whether the language tag on the opening fence (e.g., \"```julia\") matches the closing fence (\"```\"). If you need to handle different languages, you would need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[89,296],"elapsed":8.504459326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
