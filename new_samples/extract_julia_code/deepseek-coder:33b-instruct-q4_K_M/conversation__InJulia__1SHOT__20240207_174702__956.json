It then iterates over each line. If it encounters a line that starts with `\"```julia\"` or `\"``` julia\"` (meaning it's the start of a Julia code block), it sets `in_block = true` and continues to the next iteration skipping this line. \n\nIf it encounters a line that starts with `\"```\"` and we are already inside a code block (i.e., `in_block = true`), it means we've reached the end of a code block, so it sets `in_block = false` to indicate that we're no longer in a Julia block. \n\nIf none of these conditions is met and `in_block = true`, it appends this line to `code_blocks` because we are inside a code block. \n\nFinally, it joins all the lines in `code_blocks` with newlines (`\"\\n\"`) and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":12.438487583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
