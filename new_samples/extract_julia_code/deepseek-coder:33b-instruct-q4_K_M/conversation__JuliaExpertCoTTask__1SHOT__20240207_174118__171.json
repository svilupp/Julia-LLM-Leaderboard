Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that fulfills your task requirements in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    julia_lines = String[]\n    in_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"julia\")\n            in_block = !in_block\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_block\n            pushfirst_ignoreempty(julia_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(reverse(julia_lines), '\\n')\nend\n\nfunction pushfirst_ignoreempty(arr::Array{String}, el::String)\n    if !isempty(strip(el))\n        pushfirst(arr, el)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into lines and then checking each line. If a line starts with `\"```\"` and ends with `\"julia\"`, it toggles a boolean variable indicating whether we are inside a code block. If the boolean is true (we are inside a Julia code block), the function checks if the line is not empty after stripping any whitespace from both ends and if so, adds it to an array of Julia lines. At the end, the function joins all the Julia lines together with newlines and returns the resulting string.\n\nThis function assumes that code blocks are correctly formatted (i.e., each code block starts with `\"```julia\"` and ends with `\"```\") and does not handle errors if this is not the case. Also, it removes empty lines within the Julia code blocks but keeps the newlines between different code blocks as these are required to join the code together correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":11.646079292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
