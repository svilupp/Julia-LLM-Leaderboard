[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```Julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    julia_blocks = filter(!isempty, split(md, \"```\"))\n    julia_codes = String[]\n    \n    for block in julia_blocks\n        if startswith(block, \"julia\") || startswith(block, \"\\njulia\")\n            code = strip(split(block, \"\\n\", limit=2)[end])\n            pushfirst(code, \"\\n\" => \"\", \"\\r\" => \"\") do str  # replace all newline characters with empty string\n                replace(str, r\"\\R+\" => \"\\n\")\n            end\n            append!!(julia_codes, code)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_codes, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the input string `md` into blocks based on \"```\" characters. It then iterates over these blocks and checks if each block starts with \"julia\" or \"\\njulia\", which is the markdown syntax for Julia code blocks. If a block does start with these, it extracts the actual code from within the block by splitting the block on newline characters and taking only the last part of the split (which will be the code), and pushes this into an array `julia_codes`.\n\nAfter going through all blocks, it joins together all extracted Julia codes in `julia_codes` with a newline character as a separator to form one single string. This string is then returned by the function. \n\nThe `append!!` function is used instead of `pushfirst!!` to avoid creating intermediate arrays and reducing memory allocation. The `replace(str, r\"\\R+\" => \"\\n\")` line replaces all non-newline whitespace characters (such as tab or space) with a newline character for readability.","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":13.026923709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
