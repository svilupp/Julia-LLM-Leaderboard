[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is your function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    julia_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\\n\")[2:end] # split by markdown code fence and get all the Julia blocks\n    joined_blocks = join(map(x -> replace(x, r\"```.*$\"s => \"\"), julia_blocks), \"\\n\\n\") # remove last code fence from each block and then join them with a newline\n    return joined_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string `md` into multiple substrings using the Julia language code blocks as separators. It then maps over all these substrings, removing the closing code fences (which is done by replacing any sequence of three backticks followed by anything and a newline at the end with nothing), before joining them together again with newlines in between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[0,218],"elapsed":6.18913816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
