Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write a function to extract Julia code from markdown files in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    julia_lines = String[]\n    in_block = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || (in_block && startswith(line, \"\\t\"))\n            in_block = true\n            pushfirstpointcutting_at_last_character(julia_lines, '`')\n        elseif !startswith(line, \"```\")\n            if in_block \n                pushfirstpointcutting_at_last_character(julia_lines, '`')\n            end\n            in_block = false\n        end\n    end\n    return join(julia_lines, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThe function works by splitting the input string into lines and then checking each line for markdown code block indicators. If it finds a line that starts with `\"```julia\"` or (if it's inside a code block and starts with a tab), it adds the rest of the line (minus any trailing backticks) to `julia_lines`. When it encounters a line that doesn't start with `\"```\"`, it stops adding lines to `julia_lines`. Finally, it joins all lines in `julia_lines` into one string separated by newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[130,347],"elapsed":10.029454965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
