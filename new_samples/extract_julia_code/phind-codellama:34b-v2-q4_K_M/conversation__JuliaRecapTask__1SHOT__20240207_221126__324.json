[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

In this case, we will need `Markdown` to work with markdown documents and `CodecZlib` for handling gzip-compressed files (if needed).\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nimport CodecZlib\n```\n\nNow, let's define the function `extract_julia_code`. \n\nThe function will take one argument, `md`, which is the markdown document. The Julia code blocks in this document are enclosed by triple backticks followed by `julia` keyword (and optionally some info string) and ended by triple backticks.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"^```julia[\\s\\S]*?^```$\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of julia code blocks in the md document\n    matches = findall(pattern, md, RegexM.MULTILINE)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted julia code\n    julia_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each match\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the starting and ending triple backticks and the \"julia\" keyword\n        code = replace(match.match, r\"^```julia\\n?\" => \"\", r\"\\n?^```$\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Append the extracted julia code to the output string with a newline character in between\n        julia_code *= code * '\\n'\n    end\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function finds all Julia code blocks in the provided markdown document, removes the backticks and \"julia\" keyword, and joins them together with a newline character.\n\nYou can use this function to extract julia code from a markdown document like this:\n\n```julia\nmd_doc = \"\"\"\nHere's some Julia code:\n\\```julia\nx = 10\nfor i in 1:5\n    println(i * x)\nend\n\\```\nAnd here's more:\n\\```julia\ny = \"Hello, World!\"\nprintln(\"Julia says: $y\")\n\\```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md_doc)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis will output the extracted julia code:\n\n```\nx = 10\nfor i in 1:5\n    println(i * x)\nend\n\ny = \"Hello, World!\"\nprintln(\"Julia says: $y\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,624],"elapsed":17.363774451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
