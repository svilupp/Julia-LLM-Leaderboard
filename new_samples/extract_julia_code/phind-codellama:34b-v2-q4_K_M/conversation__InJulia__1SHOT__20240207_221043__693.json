It then iterates over each element in the parsed tree and checks if it is a CodeBlock. If so, it extracts the language of the code block. If the language is \"julia\" or an empty string (i.e., no language specified), it removes the code fences (`` ` ``) and appends the result to an array of Julia code. Finally, it joins all the extracted Julia code together with a newline before returning it as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":10.957423119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
