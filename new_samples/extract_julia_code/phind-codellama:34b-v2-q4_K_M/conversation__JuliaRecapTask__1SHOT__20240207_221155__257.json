[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem is about parsing and processing a markdown document to extract all the code blocks containing Julia language code. Here is how we can solve this using the `Markdown` package in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    md_parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    julia_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each element in the parsed markdown\n    for element in md_parsed.content\n        # Check if the element is a code block\n        if typeof(element) == Markdown.Code\n            # Check if the language specified is Julia\n            if element.language == \"julia\" || element.language == \"\"\n                # Remove newline characters and append to julia_code string\n                julia_code *= replace(element.code, r\"\\n\" => \" \") * \"\\n\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes as input a string `md` containing the markdown document. It first parses this document using the `Markdown.parse()` function from the Julia Markdown package. \n\nThe parsed document is then looped through, and each element is checked if it's a code block by checking its type. If it is a code block, the function verifies if the language specified for the code block is Julia (it might be empty if no language was specified). If yes, it removes all newline characters from the code block and appends it to the `julia_code` string, separated by a single space.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `julia_code` string containing all extracted Julia code blocks joined together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,399],"elapsed":11.077164941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
