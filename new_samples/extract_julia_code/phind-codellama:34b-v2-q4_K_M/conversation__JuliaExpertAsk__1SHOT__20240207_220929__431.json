Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution for your prompt:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Go through each line and look for \"```julia\" and \"```\"\n    in_julia_code = false\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if in_julia_code\n            if startswith(line, \"```\") # end of julia code block\n                in_julia_code = false\n            else\n                push!(code_blocks, line)\n            end\n        else\n            if startswith(line, \"```julia\") # start of julia code block\n                in_julia_code = true\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by reading the markdown document line by line. When it encounters a \"```julia\" line, it sets `in_julia_code` to true. From then on, it will add every non-empty line to the `code_blocks` array until it sees a line starting with \"````\".\n\nFinally, it joins all the collected code lines together into a single string using newline characters as separators and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":8.617041103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
