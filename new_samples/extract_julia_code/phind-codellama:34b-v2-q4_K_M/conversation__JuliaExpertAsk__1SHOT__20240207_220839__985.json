Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a solution using Julia's regular expression functionality to match patterns in strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression pattern for ```julia ... ```julia code blocks.\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"s\n    \n    # Vector to store all the extracted Julia code blocks.\n    julia_codes = []\n\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in md.\n    for m in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        push!(julia_codes, strip(m[1]))  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace and add to vector.\n    end\n\n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline and return.\n    return join(julia_codes, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression pattern that matches ````julia` fenced code blocks. It then searches `md` for all matches of this pattern, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each match, and adds it to a vector. Finally, it joins together all the elements in the vector with a newline character between each element and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":7.382116724,"_type":"aimessage"}]
