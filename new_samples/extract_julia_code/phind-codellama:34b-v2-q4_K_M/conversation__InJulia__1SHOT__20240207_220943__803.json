Here is a function that does what you want:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    ast = MD(md)\n    for elem in ast.content\n        if typeof(elem) == CodeBlock\n            # Check whether it is a Julia code block\n            if startswith(elem.language, \"julia\")\n                push!(code_blocks, strip(elem.code))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the markdown document using the MD function provided by the Markdown package. Then, we iterate over each element in the AST. If the element is a code block and its language is Julia, we strip the code from any leading or trailing whitespace and Whitespace-only lines at the start and end of the code and add it to our code_blocks list. Finally, we join all the code blocks together with newline characters in between and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[91,267],"elapsed":7.412047764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
