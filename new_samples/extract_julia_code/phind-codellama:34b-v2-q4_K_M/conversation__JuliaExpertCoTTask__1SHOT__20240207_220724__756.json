Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    inside_code_fence = false\n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"```\")\n            inside_code_fence = !inside_code_fence\n        elseif inside_code_fence\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document as input and returns a string consisting of all the code blocks present in it. It does this by going through each line of the document and checking if it's a code fence. If we encounter a line that starts with \"```\", we switch the state of `inside_code_fence` from true to false or vice versa.\n\nIf we are inside a code fence, we add the current line to our list of code blocks. At the end, we join all the code blocks together using a newline character and return the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.118312971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
