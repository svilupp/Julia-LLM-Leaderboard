Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `eachmatch` function from Julia's regex package to find all matches of a pattern in a string. To extract julia code blocks, you need to match anything between triple backticks and the word \"julia\". Then remove the backticks and \"julia\" from extracted strings.\n\nHere is the `extract_julia_code` function that solves this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\", md)\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function finds all matches of the pattern ````julia\\n(.*?)````, capturing everything between \"julia\" and the closing triple backticks. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters, which means it will stop at the first occurrence of the following pattern rather than the last. This is important because it allows us to match multiple code blocks in the same document.\n\nNow you can call this function with your provided data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\"\nextract_julia_code(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":8.596910455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
