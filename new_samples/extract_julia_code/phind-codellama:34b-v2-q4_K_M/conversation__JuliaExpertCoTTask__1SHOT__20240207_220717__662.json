[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nYou can use the `occursin` function to check if a line is a code fence and then remove it. Use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from each line of code. Finally, join all the lines together with a newline character.\n\nHere's how you could write the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    in_code = false\n    code = String[]\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(r\"^```\", line)\n            in_code = !in_code\n        elseif in_code\n            push!(code, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code, '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the input string. If it encounters a line that starts with `````, it toggles the `in_code` variable which keeps track of whether we are currently inside a code block or not. If `in_code` is true and the line isn't a code fence, it adds the line (after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces) to the `code` array. Finally, it joins all the lines in the `code` array together with newline characters and returns the result.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input is properly formatted markdown with balanced code fences. It doesn't handle cases where there are unbalanced fences or fences of other types (e.g., for other languages).","status":200,"tokens":[213,359],"elapsed":10.087912784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
