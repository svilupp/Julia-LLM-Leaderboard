If an element is a code block with language \"julia\" or no specified language, it's added to `code_blocks` after being stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. Finally, all code blocks are joined together with newline characters in between.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":6.333322101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
