Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia([\\s\\S]*?)```\"\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string\n    matches = findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the julia code from each match and remove code fences\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join all code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regular expression to search the input string for Julia code blocks, which are delimited by triple backticks followed by \"julia\" (i.e., ```julia). The regex pattern `[\\s\\S]*?` is used to match the minimum amount of characters between the opening and closing delimiters, effectively capturing only the code within the block. This function then returns all captured codes joined by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":7.122772456,"_type":"aimessage"}]
