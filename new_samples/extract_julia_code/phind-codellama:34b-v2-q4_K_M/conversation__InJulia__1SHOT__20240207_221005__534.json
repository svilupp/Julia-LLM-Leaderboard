Then, it loops through each block and checks if it's a Julia code block by looking for the \"julia\" keyword at the start of the block. If it is a Julia code block, it removes the \"julia\" keyword (and any preceding whitespace) from the block, and then appends the rest of the block to `jl_code`, followed by a newline character. Finally, it returns `jl_code` after processing all the blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":6.984790057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
