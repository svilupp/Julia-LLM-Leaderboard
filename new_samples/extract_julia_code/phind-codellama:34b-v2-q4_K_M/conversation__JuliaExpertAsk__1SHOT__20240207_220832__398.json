Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could approach this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia(.+?)```\"ms\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in md\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    # Extract the matched code blocks (excluding the fences)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regex pattern to find all Julia code blocks in the input Markdown string. The `ms` flags used in the pattern are for multiline matching (to allow the dot to match newlines) and for dotall mode (to also allow the dot to match any character including newline).\n\nEach match is then processed to extract the actual code inside the fences, excluding the fences themselves. These extracted code blocks are joined together with a newline character and returned as the final result.","status":200,"tokens":[121,261],"elapsed":7.277095073,"_type":"aimessage"}]
