If an element is a code block and its language is set to \"julia\", it removes the code fences (the ```julia at the start and end of the code block) and appends the rest of the code to `julia_code`. Finally, it returns `julia_code`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":8.525101534,"_type":"aimessage"}]
