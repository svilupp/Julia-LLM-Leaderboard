Here's a function that implements this:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = MD(Markdown.parse(md))\n    codes = []\n    for elem in doc.content\n        if isa(elem, Markdown.Code) && endswith(elem.language, \"jl\")\n            push!(codes, elem.code)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown document and converts it into a Markdown.MD object. Then, it iterates over each element in the MD object. If the element is a code block with language \"jl\" (Julia), it adds the code to the `codes` array. Finally, it returns all the codes joined by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":5.745624676,"_type":"aimessage"}]
