Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple way to do it using Regular Expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # regex pattern for ```julia ... ``` code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    \n    # find all matches of the pattern in md\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(pattern, md))\n    \n    # extract julia code from matches and join with \"\\n\"\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses a regex pattern to match ```julia ... ```` code blocks. The `.*?` part of the pattern is a non-greedy match on filler between the two sets of triple backticks, which means it'll match as few characters as possible, stopping at the first ```` that it encounters. This ensures that if there are multiple julia code blocks in the input string, they will all be matched separately.\n\nThis function collects all matches into an array and then extracts the captured groups (which contain the actual julia code), joining them together with newline characters between each code block to produce the final result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":7.523519839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
