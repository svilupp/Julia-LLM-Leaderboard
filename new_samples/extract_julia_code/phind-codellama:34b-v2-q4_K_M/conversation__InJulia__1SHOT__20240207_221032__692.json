Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Parse the markdown document and get the parsed elements\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Initialize an array to store all the julia code\n    julia_code = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the parsed document\n    for element in parsed\n        # Check if the element is a Markdown.Code block\n        if typeof(element) == Markdown.Code\n            # Remove ```julia ... ``` or ```jl ... ``` (first and last line of code blocks)\n            # and push remaining lines into julia_code array\n            push!(julia_code, filter(x -> !isempty(x), split(element.code, '\\n')[2:end-1])...)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code together with a newline and return it as a string\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown document and gets all the parsed elements. It then iterates through each element and checks if it's a Markdown.Code block. If it is, we remove the ```julia ... ``` or ```jl ... ``` (first and last line of code blocks) and push remaining lines into julia_code array. Finally, it joins all the code together with a newline and returns it as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":9.841952088,"_type":"aimessage"}]
