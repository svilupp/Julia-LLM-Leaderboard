It then filters out all non-code blocks. For each code block, it checks whether the language is set to \"julia\" (case-insensitively). If so, it removes the code fence and appends it to the output. Finally, it joins all the collected Julia code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that code blocks without a specified language or with languages other than \"julia\" should be ignored.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.716165786,"_type":"aimessage"}]
