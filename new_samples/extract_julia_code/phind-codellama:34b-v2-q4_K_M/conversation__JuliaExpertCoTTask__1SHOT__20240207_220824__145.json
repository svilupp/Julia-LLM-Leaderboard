Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task involves writing a function `extract_julia_code` that processes a markdown string and extracts all the code blocks, removes the fences and concatenates them. The output should be a single string. Here is how you can approach this problem:\n\n- Start by creating a function called `extract_julia_code`. This function will take one argument - a string `md` which represents the markdown document.\n\n- Use the function `occurrences` to find the number of ```` ```julia``` `` code fences in the markdown document. This can be done using the following line of code:\n  ```\n  n_fences = occurrences(md, \"```julia\")\n  ```\n\n- Now, you need to extract all the code blocks from the markdown document. You can do this by iterating over each fence and slicing the string accordingly. Store all the extracted code blocks in an array called `code_blocks`.\n\n- After you have extracted all the code blocks, remove the code fences from each block using the function `replace`. \n\n- Finally, join all the code blocks together with a newline character and return the result. You can do this using the following line of code:\n  ```\n  return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n  ```\n\nHere is how the complete function `extract_julia_code` looks like:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    n_fences = occurrences(md, \"```julia\")\n    \n    code_blocks = String[]\n    for i in 1:2:n_fences\n        start_idx = findnext(\"```julia\", md, i) + length(\"```julia\")\n        end_idx = findnext(\"```\", md, start_idx) - 1\n        code_block = md[start_idx:end_idx]\n        push!(code_blocks, replace(code_block, \"```\" => \"\"))\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nYou can now test this function using the provided markdown document. This should output:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,513],"elapsed":14.135673426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
