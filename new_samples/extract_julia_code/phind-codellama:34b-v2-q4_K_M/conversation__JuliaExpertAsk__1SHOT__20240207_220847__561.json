Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can approach this problem:\n\n1. You need to first identify all code blocks in the markdown document. \n2. Then, remove the code fences and join each of the code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nYou can achieve this using regular expressions in Julia. Here's an example implementation for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex to match julia code blocks (assuming github flavored markdown style fences)\n    r = r\"^```.*\\n?(?<code>.*)\\n?```$\"sm\n    \n    # Vector to store all matched code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Find all matches in the input string\n    for m in eachmatch(r, md)\n        push!(code_blocks, m[:code])\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will extract all the Julia code from given markdown `md` and return it as a single string, where each line of code is separated by a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":7.572767302,"_type":"aimessage"}]
