[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It uses recursion to process nested code blocks, i.e., when it encounters an MD element inside another MD element. The function skips non-Julia code blocks and joins multiple code blocks together with newlines.\n\nTo test this function:\n```julia\nmarkdown_string = \"\"\"\nHere is a markdown document with Julia code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction hello()\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\nend\n```\n\nAnd here's some more code:\n\n```julia\nhello()\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(markdown_string)\nprint(extracted_code)\n```\nThis test should print the contents of both Julia code blocks joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[391,397],"elapsed":11.398981607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
