Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regex pattern for ```julia ... ```julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n    julia_blocks = [match.captures[] for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    julia_code = replace.(julia_blocks, \"```\" => \"\")\n    return join(julia_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first using a regular expression (`pattern`) to find all instances of ```julia ... ```julia code blocks in the provided markdown document (`md`). It does this by capturing everything between the opening and closing fences (excluding the fences themselves).\n\nThe captured code blocks are then processed to remove any remaining code fences, before being joined together with newline characters separating each block. The resulting string of Julia code is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":6.367450481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
