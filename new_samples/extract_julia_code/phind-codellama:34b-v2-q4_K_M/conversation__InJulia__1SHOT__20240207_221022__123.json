We will be making use of the `Markdown` package which provides utilities for working with markdown documents:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    ast = MD(md)\n\n    # Initialize an array to store code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n\n    # Walk through the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed markdown\n    for element in ast.content\n        if isa(element, Markdown.Code) && endswith(element.language, \"jl\")\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, element.code)\n        elseif isa(element, Markdown.MD)\n            # Recursively search for code blocks in nested blockquote elements\n            for subelement in element.content\n                if isa(subelement, Markdown.Code) && endswith(subelement.language, \"jl\")\n                    push!(julia_code_blocks, subelement.code)\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline and return the result\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function parses the input markdown document, iterates over its elements looking for Julia code blocks (which are indicated by the presence of \"jl\" in the language field), and collects all the found code into an array. Finally, it joins all the collected code blocks together with a newline character and returns this string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,369],"elapsed":10.090162141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
