It then extracts the text between these fences, removes any trailing newlines or whitespace at the beginning or end of each block, and joins them together into a single string using the `join` function.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that all code blocks are written in Julia (as indicated by the \"```julia\" fence). If you want to handle other programming languages as well, you would need to modify the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":7.265997235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
