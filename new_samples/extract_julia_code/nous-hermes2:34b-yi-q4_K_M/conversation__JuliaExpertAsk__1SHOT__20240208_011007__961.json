Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    start, end_ = 0, 1\n\n    while start < length(lines)-1 && lines[end_-2] == \"```\" && lines[end_  -1] == \"julia\"\n        code = join(lines[(start+1):(end_-2)])\n        append!(start, [code, \"\\n\"])\n        start += 3\n        end_ += 1\n    end\n\n    join(start)\nend\n```\nThis `extract_julia_code` function takes a markdown document as an input and extracts the Julia code blocks by iteratively checking if the previous line is a code fence (`````) followed by the Julia language name. If so, it joins all lines between the code fences into a single string, adds a newline character to separate code blocks, and updates the start and end indices accordingly. The function returns a String containing all extracted Julia code blocks joined with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":6.958219918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
