It then initializes an empty string `code` which will store the extracted julia code blocks. The function loops through each line of the markdown document, checking if it is a julia code fence (starts with \"```julia\") or a closing code fence (ends with \"```\"). If a line is identified as either a code fence or a closing code fence, the previous code block is appended to `code` and reset. If a line is not a code fence or a closing code fence, it is appended to the current code block. The function then returns the extracted julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":13.442739493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
