[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Then, using a combination of `filter` and `findall` functions, it extracts all code blocks that start with a Julia fence (````julia`) and removes any stray fences in the remaining code lines. It then joins these code lines together (if there are multiple) and returns the resulting string with the Julia fences added back to the beginning and end of the string.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `extract_julia_code(md)` where `md` is a markdown document containing julia language code blocks. The output will be a string that contains all the extracted code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":14.231372819,"_type":"aimessage"}]
