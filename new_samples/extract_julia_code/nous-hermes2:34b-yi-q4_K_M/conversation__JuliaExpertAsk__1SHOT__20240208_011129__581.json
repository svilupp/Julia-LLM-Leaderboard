It uses a few helper functions (like `startsWith` and `endsWith`) provided by the Markdown package to determine if the current line starts or ends a code block. \n\nWhen starting a new code block, it sets the boolean flag `in_code_block` to `true` and creates an empty array called `code_block` that will contain all lines of the current code block.\n\nIf ending a code block (by detecting the end line with three backticks), it sets `in_code_block` to `false`, joins the contents of the `code_block` array using a newline character (`\\n`) and adds this joined string to the `result` String.\n\nIf we're still in a code block, it appends the current line to the `code_block` array. The final result is returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":12.16232791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
