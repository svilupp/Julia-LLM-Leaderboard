[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In order to solve this problem, we need to extract all Julia code blocks from the markdown document and concatenate them into a single string. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n1) We will use the `Markdown` package in Julia to parse the markdown document. This package provides an easy way to convert markdown to HTML, which we can then extract code blocks from.\n\n2) We will loop through all the elements of the parsed HTML and check for code blocks using a regex pattern that matches the format of code fences in markdown (i.e. lines starting with ` ``` ` or `~~~` followed by a language identifier, e.g. `julia`).\n\n3) Once we find a code block, we will extract its contents and remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the lines within it. We will also remove the code fences themselves.\n\n4) Finally, we will join all the extracted code blocks together into one string using a newline character `\\n` as separator.\n\nHere's an example implementation of this approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse markdown to HTML\n    html = md |> Markdown.parse |> Markdown.HTML.Md.htmlize\n\n    # Initialize an empty string for extracted code blocks\n    output = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through all elements of the parsed HTML\n    for e in children(root(html))\n        if starts_with(string(e), r\"^<pre><code[^>]*julia[^>]*\\>\") || starts_with(string(e), r\"^<pre><code class=\\\"language-julia\\\"[^>]*\\>\")\n            # Extract the code block content\n            content = e.child |> replace.(line -> \"\\n\" == line ? \"\" : line, 1:end) |> join\n\n            # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from lines within the code block\n            lines = split(content)\n            trimmed_lines = map(x -> strip(x), lines)\n            clean_content = join(trimmed_lines, \"\\n\")\n\n            # Add the cleaned code to the output string\n            output *= clean_content\n        end\n    end\n\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work for any markdown document containing Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,546],"elapsed":16.301419526,"_type":"aimessage"}]
