[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The solution will be a string containing all of the extracted code. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, recall Julia snippets that might come in handy for this task. We can use regular expressions to extract code blocks from markdown text.\n\n2. Next, let's solve the task by defining and implementing a function called `extract_julia_code` which takes a string `md` as input. Within this function, we will convert all markdown code fences into Julia code:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Convert all code blocks to julia language code blocks\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Regular expression to match any three backticks and what's between them\n    regex = r\"```(\\w+)\\n([\\S\\n]+?)\\n```\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string for the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop over each match of the regular expression in the markdown text\n    for match in eachmatch(regex, md)\n        # Get the language (julia) and contents between backticks\n        language, code_block = match.captures[1], match.captures[2]\n\n        if language == \"julia\" # If the language is julia\n            code *= code_block # Add the julia code to our final result\n        end\n    end\n\n    return code # Return the extracted julia code as a string\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it on a markdown document with Julia code blocks, like this:\n\n```markdown\n# Title\nThis is a test document\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello World!\")\n1 + 2\n```\n\nSome text followed by more Julia code.\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"The answer is $(3^2)\")\n```\n\nAnd even more text.\n```\n\n4. Call the function with this markdown document:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"# Title\nThis is a test document\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello World!\")\n1 + 2\n```\n\nSome text followed by more Julia code.\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"The answer is $(3^2)\")\n```\n\nAnd even more text.\"\"\"\n\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\n\n5. The output should be the extracted julia code, which in this case would be:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello World!\"); 1 + 2; println(\"The answer is $(3^2)\")\n```\n\nThis solution works by first matching all the code blocks in the markdown text using a regular expression. Then, it checks if each language is Julia (`language == \"julia\"`) and adds its contents to the final result. The resulting string contains only the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,695],"elapsed":20.689272695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
