Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Define patterns for Julia code blocks and code fences\n    pattern = r\"`{3,}\\n[\\s\\S]+?\\n`{3,}\"\n    fence_open = \"^```julia$\"\n    fence_close = \"^```$\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Split the markdown document into lines and iterate over each line\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        # Check if a code fence is encountered\n        if match(fence_open, line) !== nothing\n            # If a Julia code block starts, enter extraction mode\n            code = \"\"\n        elseif match(fence_close, line) !== nothing\n            # If a Julia code block ends and it is the last one, exit extraction mode\n            code = code == \"\" ? \"\" : replace(code, r\"\\r\\n|\\r|\\n{2,}|```$\" => \"\")\n            return code\n        elseif match(pattern, line) !== nothing\n            # If a Julia code block is encountered, add it to the extracted code\n            code *= replace(match(pattern, line).captures[1], r\"^```julia|\\n```$\" => \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return an empty string if no Julia code was found\n    return \"\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown document `md` as input and returns the extracted Julia code as a String. It first defines patterns for Julia code blocks (using triple backticks) and code fences, which are used to identify the start and end of each block. The function then splits the markdown document into lines and iterates over each line. If a code fence is encountered (````julia` or `````), it checks if extraction mode should be entered or exited (by comparing it with an empty string). If a Julia code block is found within a code fence, its contents are added to the extracted code after removing any unnecessary whitespace and the triple backticks surrounding it. Finally, any trailing newlines are removed before returning the extracted code as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,520],"elapsed":15.269797027,"_type":"aimessage"}]
