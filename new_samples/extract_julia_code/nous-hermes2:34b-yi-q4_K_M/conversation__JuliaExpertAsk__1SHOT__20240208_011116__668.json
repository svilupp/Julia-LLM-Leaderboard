Splits the input string into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n2. Finds the start index of a Julia code block by searching for the first occurrence of \"```\" (with some conditions to avoid false positives) in the list of lines.\n3. Finds the end index of a Julia code block by searching for the first occurrence of \"```\" after the start index, with similar conditions to avoid false positives.\n4. If both start and end indices are found, joins all the lines between those indices (excluding the last \"```\" line) together using `join([lines[i] for i in start_index:end_index], '\\n')`.\n5. Returns the joined code block as a String.\n6. If no Julia code blocks are found, it throws an error with the message \"No Julia code blocks found.\"","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":12.034588342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
