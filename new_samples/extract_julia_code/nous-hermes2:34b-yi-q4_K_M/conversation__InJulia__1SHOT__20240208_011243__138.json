It checks for lines that start with \"```julia\\n\" (which denotes the beginning of a code block) or end with \"julia\" followed by \"```\" (which denotes the ending of a code block). If it finds such a line, it adds an empty string to `julia_blocks`. Otherwise, if it encounters another code block starting with \"```\" and ending with \"julia\" without encountering an ending \"```\", it appends that line to `julia_blocks` along with the trailing newline character. The function then joins all the elements of `julia_blocks` into a single string using the `join` function and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":10.124129734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
