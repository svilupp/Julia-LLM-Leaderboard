The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # Prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # Prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # Prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())) # Prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":5.934105702,"_type":"aimessage"}]
