All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We can then create a function that checks if the provided vehicle is one of the known personal vehicle types: Car and Motorcycle.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Personal <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Known vehicle types\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(typeof(v))\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = Personal()\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = Personal()\nispersonal(_) = false\n```\n\nNow, we can check if a provided vehicle is personal or not:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Outputs: Personal()\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # Outputs: Personal()\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))     # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))    # Outputs: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Personal()))   # Outputs: true (just to show the trait works as intended)\n```\n\nThe above code will output `Personal()` for Car and Motorcycle types, while Bus and Truck will return `false`. Any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, such as `Personal()` in this case, returns `true` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":9.958519446,"_type":"aimessage"}]
