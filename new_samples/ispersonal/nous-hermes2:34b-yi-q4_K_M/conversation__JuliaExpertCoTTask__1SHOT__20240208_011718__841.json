Create a new type called `PersonalVehicle` with all the personal vehicles as its subtypes: Car and Motorcycle.\n2. Define the function `ispersonal` which checks if the provided Vehicle type is an instance of PersonalVehicle or not. If it is, return true; otherwise, return false.\n3. Test the function by passing different vehicle types and ensure that the output matches the given conditions.\n4.
