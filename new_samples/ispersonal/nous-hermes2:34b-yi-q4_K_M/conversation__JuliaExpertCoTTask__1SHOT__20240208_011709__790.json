All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define a type hierarchy with `AbstractVehicle` as the abstract supertype and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n2. Create an `ispersonal` function that takes any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n3. Check if the provided vehicle type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` using pattern matching. If so, return true; otherwise, check for types other than `Bus` and `Truck` and return false. For `Bus` and `Truck`, always return false.\n4. Test the function with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(other_vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = ispersonal(other_vehicle.vehicle_type)\n```\n\n# Example usage:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # returns true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # returns false\nprintln(ispersonal(Car2::AbstractVehicle)) # returns false (if Car2 is a different subtype of AbstractVehicle)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":10.607929442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
