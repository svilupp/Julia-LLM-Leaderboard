We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes a type parameter which should be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe function is defaulted to return `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. However, it has specializations defined for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types where it returns `true`.\n\nFinally, an example usage of this code is given. We define a list of vehicle types and then iterate over them, printing whether each type is a personal vehicle according to our function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,347],"elapsed":9.476253848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
