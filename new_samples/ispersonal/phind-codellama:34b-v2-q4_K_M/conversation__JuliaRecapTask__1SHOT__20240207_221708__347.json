[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}` checks if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle, which is the case for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, by returning true when the type `T` belongs to `[Car, Motorcycle]`, and false otherwise. \n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))      # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))       # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))     # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":7.711157875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
