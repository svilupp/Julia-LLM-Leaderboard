All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation of this problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in [Car, Motorcycle]\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by checking if the provided type `T` is in the list of personal vehicles (Car and Motorcycle). If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. \n\nYou can check this function with the example below:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))       # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))        # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))      # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":5.990998451,"_type":"aimessage"}]
