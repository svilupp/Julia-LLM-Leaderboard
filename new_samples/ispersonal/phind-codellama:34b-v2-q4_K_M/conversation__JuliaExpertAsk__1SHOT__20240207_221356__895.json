All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia implementation for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in (Car, Motorcycle)\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then define four subtypes of it: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The function `ispersonal` takes a type parameter `T<:AbstractVehicle`, which denotes that `T` should be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe function returns true if `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and false otherwise. This is done by checking whether `T` is in the tuple `(Car, Motorcycle)`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[145,311],"elapsed":8.685489681,"_type":"aimessage"}]
