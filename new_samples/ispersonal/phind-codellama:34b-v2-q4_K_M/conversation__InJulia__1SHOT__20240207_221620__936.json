The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define a method for `ispersonal` function that checks if the given vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving by checking its type. Here's how it can be done:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the ispersonal function\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{V}) where {V<:AbstractVehicle} = false\n```\n\nIn this example, `ispersonal` function takes a type of vehicle as an argument. If the type is Car or Motorcycle it returns true, if Bus or Truck - it returns false, for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle it returns false as well.\n\nYou can check the `ispersonal` function with some examples:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.013487593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
