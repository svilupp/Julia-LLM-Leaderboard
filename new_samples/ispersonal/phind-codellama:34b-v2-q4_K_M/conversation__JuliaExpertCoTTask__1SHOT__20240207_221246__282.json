We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes an argument of type `AbstractVehicle`. Inside the function, we use multiple dispatch to handle each subtype of `AbstractVehicle` differently. If the vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns true. If it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`, the function returns false. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nThe example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the `ispersonal` function with instances of each vehicle type and prints the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[219,436],"elapsed":12.263079878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
