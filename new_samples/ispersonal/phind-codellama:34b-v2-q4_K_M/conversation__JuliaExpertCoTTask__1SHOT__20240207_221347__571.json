All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The task can be approached by using multiple dispatch in Julia which allows us to define methods for the `ispersonal` function that will work on different types such as Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. We will also use the AbstractVehicle supertype to create a default behavior for unspecified subtypes.\n\nHere's how the solution can be implemented:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n# Add more vehicle types if needed\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\n# Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with some examples:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```\n\nAs you can see from the results, the `ispersonal` function returns true for Car and Motorcycle types (personal vehicles), and false for Bus and Truck types (not personal vehicles). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to return false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":10.212411591,"_type":"aimessage"}]
