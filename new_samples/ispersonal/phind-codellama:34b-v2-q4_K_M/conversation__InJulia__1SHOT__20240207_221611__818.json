If it is, then it returns `true`, since only these two types are considered personal vehicles. For any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, such as `Bus` and `Truck`, the function returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.694931952,"_type":"aimessage"}]
