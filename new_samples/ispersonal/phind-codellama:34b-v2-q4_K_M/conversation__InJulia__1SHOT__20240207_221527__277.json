It also includes a function `ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})` which returns true for the personal vehicles (i.e., `Car` and `Motorcycle`) and false otherwise.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\n\nThe function `ispersonal` is defined such that it returns `false` by default for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. It then specifically defines the return value for `Car` and `Motorcycle` to be `true`, while leaving other subtypes (`Bus`, `Truck`, or any future subtypes) to fall back to the default behavior.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))      # Outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))# Outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))       # Outputs false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))     # Outputs false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":9.291869108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
