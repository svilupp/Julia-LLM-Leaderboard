All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then you can use multiple dispatch to implement the `ispersonal` function for different subtypes of AbstractVehicle:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\nispersonal(vehicle::Car) = true\nispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle) = true\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then define four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`. The default behavior of function `ispersonal` is to return false. But for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, we specifically override this function to return true.\n\nNow let's check our function with an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # Output: true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":6.845579457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
