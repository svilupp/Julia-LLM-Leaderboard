All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in (Car, Motorcycle)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck)) # false\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` is a function that takes in a type parameterized on `T<:AbstractVehicle`. The function returns `true` if `T` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. This is because cars and motorcycles are typically personal vehicles used for everyday driving, while buses and trucks are not. \n\nThis solution assumes that all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` other than `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` will return false. If there are other subtypes that should also return `false`, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":7.680803183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
