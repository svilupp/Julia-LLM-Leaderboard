The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

There are four subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck`.\nThe function `ispersonal` checks if a vehicle type falls into the personal vehicle category (i.e., `Car` or `Motorcycle`). If that's the case, it returns true; otherwise, false.\n\nExample of usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":7.13891035,"_type":"aimessage"}]
