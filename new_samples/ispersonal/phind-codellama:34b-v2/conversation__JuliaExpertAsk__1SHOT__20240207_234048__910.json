All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false # default to false\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car}) \n    println(\"This vehicle is a Car and suitable for everyday driving.\")\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    println(\"This vehicle is a Motorcycle and suitable for everyday driving.\")\n    return true\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we first defined an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and then four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then implemented the function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false` to return false by default for all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. \n\nThe next two functions, `ispersonal(::Type{Car})` and `ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})`, are specific implementations for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types. When called, they print a statement and return true. \n\nLet's see an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car) # returns true\nThis vehicle is a Car and suitable for everyday driving.\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle) # returns true\nThis vehicle is a Motorcycle and suitable for everyday driving.\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus) # returns false\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck) # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":10.550411569,"_type":"aimessage"}]
