All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia code snippet that achieves this:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in [Car, Motorcycle]  # Return true for Car and Motorcycle\nend\n\n# Testing the function\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))         # Returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))   # Returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))          # Returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))        # Returns: false\n```\n\nThis code first defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes of it. Then it defines a function `ispersonal` that checks if its argument is one of the personal vehicle types (`Car` or `Motorcycle`), in which case it returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThe testing part at the end of the code creates an instance of each vehicle type and passes them to the `ispersonal` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":7.097267915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
