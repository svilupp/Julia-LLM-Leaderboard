All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We create a function ispersonal that returns true if the input type is either Car or Motorcycle (i.e., personal vehicles), and false otherwise. \n\nThis code can be easily extended to add more vehicle types; you just need to include them in the list of personal vehicles in the `ispersonal` function definition.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":6.864892721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
