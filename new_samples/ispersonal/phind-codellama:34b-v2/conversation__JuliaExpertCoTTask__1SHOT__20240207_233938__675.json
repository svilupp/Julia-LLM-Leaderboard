All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for your problem:\n\nFirst we define `AbstractVehicle` and its subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then, we write the function `isPersonal` to return true if the vehicle type is a Car or Motorcycle (personal vehicles), and false otherwise.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle \nend\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle \nend\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle \nend\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle \nend\n\nfunction isPersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\nend\n```\nNow, we test the function with examples:\n\n```julia\nprintln(isPersonal(Car()))         # Expected output: true\nprintln(isPersonal(Motorcycle()))   # Expected output: true\nprintln(isPersonal(Bus()))          # Expected output: false\nprintln(isPersonal(Truck()))        # Expected output: false\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` other than `Car` and `Motorcycle` are not personal vehicles. If you have more subtypes and some of them can be considered as personal vehicles, you should adjust the `isPersonal` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.124435054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
