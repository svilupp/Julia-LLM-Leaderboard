For all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it will return false by default.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\n# Create instances of different vehicle types\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))         # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))       # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":7.030029867,"_type":"aimessage"}]
