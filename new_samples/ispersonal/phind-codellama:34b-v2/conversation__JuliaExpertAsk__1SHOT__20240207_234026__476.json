All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we need to define the `AbstractVehicle` and its subtypes:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\nThen we can define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    return T in (Car, Motorcycle) # These are personal vehicles\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the given vehicle type belongs to the personal vehicle types `Car` and `Motorcycle`. It returns `true` for these two types and `false` otherwise.\n\nWe can test this function with an example:\n```julia\nvehicles = [Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck]\nfor veh in vehicles\n    println(\"$veh is a personal vehicle: $(ispersonal(veh))\")\nend\n```\nThis code will output:\n```\nCar is a personal vehicle: true\nMotorcycle is a personal vehicle: true\nBus is a personal vehicle: false\nTruck is a personal vehicle: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":7.191380776,"_type":"aimessage"}]
