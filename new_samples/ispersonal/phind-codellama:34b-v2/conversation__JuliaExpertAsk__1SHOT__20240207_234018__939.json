All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Car, Motorcycle}}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:Union{Bus, Truck}}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false # default case\n```\n\nThis code defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four subtypes: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck. The function `ispersonal` is defined to return true for Car and Motorcycle types (personal vehicles), and false for Bus and Truck types (not personal vehicles). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function returns false by default.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nvehicles = [Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck, Bicycle] # assume Bicycle is another subtype of AbstractVehicle\nmap(ispersonal, vehicles) # map `ispersonal` function to the list of vehicle types\n```\nThis will return a list `[true, true, false, false, false]` showing whether each type in the `vehicles` list is a personal vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[145,321],"elapsed":8.329014143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
