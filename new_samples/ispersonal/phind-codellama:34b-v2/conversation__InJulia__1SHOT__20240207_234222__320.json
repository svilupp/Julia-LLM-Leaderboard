All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then it defines a function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` where `T<:AbstractVehicle`. This function checks whether the provided vehicle type is in the list `[Car, Motorcycle]`, i.e., it's a personal vehicle. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":7.622417878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
