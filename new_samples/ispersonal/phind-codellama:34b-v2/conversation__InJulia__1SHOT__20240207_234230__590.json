All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we need to define our abstract superclass and its subclasses:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\nThen, we can define our function that checks whether a given vehicle is a personal vehicle. This function uses multiple dispatch to work with different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car}) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle_type) \n    return false\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first define two specialized methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types that return `true`. Then, we provide a fallback method for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` that returns `false`. You can test the function with these example calls:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))         # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))       # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":7.589250827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
