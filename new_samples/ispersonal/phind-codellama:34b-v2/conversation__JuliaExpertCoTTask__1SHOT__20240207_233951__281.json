Write the function `ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)` that returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types and `false` for all other types (including `Bus` and `Truck`).\n4. Test the function using example calls.\n\nHere is the Julia code:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\n    return veh isa Union{Car, Motorcycle} ? true : false\nend\n\n# example usage\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))  # prints: false\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `isa` function to check if `veh` is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`.
