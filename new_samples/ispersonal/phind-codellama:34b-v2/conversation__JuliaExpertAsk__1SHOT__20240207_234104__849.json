All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, let's define the abstract type and its subtypes:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\n\nThen, we can define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    return false # default for unknown subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true # Cars are personal vehicles\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true # Motorcycles are personal vehicles\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false # Buses are not personal vehicles\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false # Trucks are not personal vehicles\nend\n```\nYou can test the function with examples like these:\n\n```julia\n@assert ispersonal(Car) == true  # should return true for Car\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle) == true  # should return true for Motorcycle\n@assert ispersonal(Bus) == false  # should return false for Bus\n@assert ispersonal(Truck) == false  # should return false for Truck\n```\n\nNote: This solution relies on the method overloading feature of Julia. The `ispersonal` function has different implementations depending on the type of its argument. If the type is not specified explicitly, the default implementation (returning `false`) will be used.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":9.83956962,"_type":"aimessage"}]
