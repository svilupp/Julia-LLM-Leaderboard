Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(::Union{Car, Motorcycle}) = true  # Car and Motorcycle are personal vehicles\n\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))        # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # returns: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))         # returns: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))       # returns: false\n```\n\nIn this code, `Car` and `Motorcycle` are concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` that we define to be personal vehicles. The function `ispersonal` uses multiple dispatch to check the type of the provided vehicle and return a corresponding trait (true or false). For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":9.113287182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
