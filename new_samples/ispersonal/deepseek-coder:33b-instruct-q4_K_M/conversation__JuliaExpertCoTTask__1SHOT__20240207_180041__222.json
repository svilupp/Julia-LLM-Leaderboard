All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible Julia solution using multiple dispatch and abstract types. \n\nFirst, we define the abstract type AbstractVehicle and its subtypes Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\n\nThen, we define the function `ispersonal` using multiple dispatch. It defaults to false for any subtype of AbstractVehicle that is not Car or Motorcycle:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) \n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Car) \n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::Motorcycle) \n    return true\nend\n```\n\nFinally, we test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```\n\nThis code will print out `true` for the first two examples and `false` for the last two, demonstrating that it correctly identifies which vehicles are personal. Note that any other type of vehicle not listed (e.g., Bicycle) will return `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,328],"elapsed":9.336362805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
