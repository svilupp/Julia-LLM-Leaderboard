All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we will be using Julia's multiple dispatch feature and the built-in `isa` function.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle) \n    if veh isa Union{Car,Motorcycle} return true\n    elseif veh isa Union{Bus,Truck} return false\n    else return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nHere `ispersonal` function uses Julia's multiple dispatch feature to determine the type of the provided argument and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a personal vehicle or not. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprint(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprint(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprint(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprint(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```\nThese lines will print `true` and then `false` four times, respectively. This is because for the types Car, Motorcycle it returns true and for Bus, Truck it returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[225,280],"elapsed":8.224156744,"_type":"aimessage"}]
