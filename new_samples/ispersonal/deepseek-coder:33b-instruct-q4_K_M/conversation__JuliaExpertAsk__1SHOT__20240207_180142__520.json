All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define a trait `Personal` and use it in your vehicle types. Here is how you could define this:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the trait Personal for vehicles that are personal\nabstract type Personal end\n\nfor Veh in subtypes(AbstractVehicle)\n    if (Veh == Car) || (Veh == Motorcycle)\n        @eval struct $(Symbol(\"Is\" * string(Veh))) <: Personal\n            vehicle::$Veh\n        end\n    elseif (Veh == Bus) || (Veh == Truck)\n        @eval struct $(Symbol(\"Not\" * string(Veh)))\n            vehicle::$Veh\n        end\n    else\n        # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n        @eval struct $(Symbol(\"Not\" * string(Veh)))\n            vehicle::$Veh\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle) = isa(veh, Personal)\n```\nThis defines the trait `Personal` for car and motorcycle types. You can check if a given vehicle is personal with the function `ispersonal`. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nispersonal(car) # should return true\n\ntruck = Truck()\nispersonal(truck) # should return false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":10.556195603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
