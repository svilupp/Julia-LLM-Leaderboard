All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For Car and Motorcycle, the function returns true. The function uses multiple dispatch to handle different types of Vehicles. \n\nWe then create an instance of `Car` (car1) and print whether it's a personal vehicle using our ispersonal function. In this example, the output would be \"Is the car personal? true\" since Car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":8.299551287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
