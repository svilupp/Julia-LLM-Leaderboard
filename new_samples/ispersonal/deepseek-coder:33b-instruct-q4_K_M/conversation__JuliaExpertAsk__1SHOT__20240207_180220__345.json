For these four types, it returns true if the type corresponds to a personal vehicle (Car or Motorcycle), and false otherwise (Bus or Truck). For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to false. The examples show how `ispersonal` is called for each of the four types and the output indicates that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":11.521746613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
