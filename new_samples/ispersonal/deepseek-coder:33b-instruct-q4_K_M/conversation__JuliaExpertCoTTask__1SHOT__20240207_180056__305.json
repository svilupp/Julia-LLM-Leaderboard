[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I will assume that you have defined your types as follows:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\nIn this case, the function would be written as follows:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(v::Car) = true\nispersonal(v::Motorcycle) = true\n```\nThis way, `ispersonal` will return `true` for Car and Motorcycle types, and `false` otherwise. You can call the function with a Car type as follows:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # returns true\n```\nPlease note that if you try to run this code in an environment where AbstractVehicle is not defined, it will throw an error. So make sure to define your types before using the function `ispersonal`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":6.561387366,"_type":"aimessage"}]
