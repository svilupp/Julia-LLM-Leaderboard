All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia code snippet that defines `ispersonal` function and implements it for different types of vehicles. I'm assuming that you already have an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and the following concrete types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false  # Default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n\n# Example usage:\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nprintln(\"Is car personal? \", ispersonal(car))        # true\nprintln(\"Is motorcycle personal? \", ispersonal(motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(\"Is bus personal? \", ispersonal(bus))          # false\nprintln(\"Is truck personal? \", ispersonal(truck))      # false\n```\nIn this code, `ispersonal` function has been defined for each concrete type of vehicle. It returns `true` for Car and Motorcycle types, `false` for Bus and Truck types, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The example usage shows how these methods can be used with some instances of these types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":10.590591299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
