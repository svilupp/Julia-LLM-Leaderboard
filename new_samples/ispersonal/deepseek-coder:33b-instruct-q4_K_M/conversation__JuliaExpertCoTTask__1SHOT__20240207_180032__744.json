All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

For any other type that's not in this list, it will return false as well.\n\nHere is an example of how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))  # prints \"true\"\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))  # prints \"false\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":7.727448174,"_type":"aimessage"}]
