All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia's multiple dispatch feature. We define `ispersonal` method for each specific vehicle type. For other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, we use the fallback method which returns false by default.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n# fallback method for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle) = false\n\n# Example: \ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # false\n```\nIn this example, we define four vehicle types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We then call `ispersonal` function on each of these types. As per our defined methods, it correctly returns true for cars and motorcycles and false for buses and trucks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":9.221572541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
