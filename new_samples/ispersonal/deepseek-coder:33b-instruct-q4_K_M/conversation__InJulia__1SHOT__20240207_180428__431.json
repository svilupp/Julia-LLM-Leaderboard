We then define a function `ispersonal` that takes as argument the type of any vehicle (not an instance of it). Based on whether the given type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, we return `true`; otherwise, we default to returning `false`. Note that if you add more types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` but not personal vehicles, they will also be treated as non-personal by our function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,340],"elapsed":9.618535207,"_type":"aimessage"}]
