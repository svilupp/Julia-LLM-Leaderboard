Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Union{Car,Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Union{Bus,Truck}) = false\n```\n2. Solve the Task:\nWe need to define a function `ispersonal` that takes an argument of type `AbstractVehicle` and returns a trait if it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. We can use multiple dispatch to define separate functions for different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, we return `true`, while for `Bus` and `Truck`, we return `false`.\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\n    if veh isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif veh isa Union{Bus, Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        error(\"Invalid vehicle type\")\n    end\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nWe can test our function by passing different subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` to it and checking the returned value. We can also use `@code_llvm` to disassemble the generated code and ensure that it is efficient.\n```julia\n@assert ispersonal(Car()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Motorcycle()) == true\n@assert ispersonal(Bus()) == false\n@assert ispersonal(Truck()) == false\n\n@code_llvm ispersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[424,438],"elapsed":11.003561087,"_type":"aimessage"}]
