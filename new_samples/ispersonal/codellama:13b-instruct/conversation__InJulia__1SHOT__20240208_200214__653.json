All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can define the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function takes a `vehicle` argument of type `AbstractVehicle` and returns true if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, false otherwise.\n\nThe function checks whether the vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns true. It also checks whether the vehicle is an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`, in which case it returns false. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function returns false by default.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nusing .ispersonal\n\n# Test with a Car\ncar = Car()\nispersonal(car) # => true\n\n# Test with a Motorcycle\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nispersonal(motorcycle) # => true\n\n# Test with a Bus\nbus = Bus()\nispersonal(bus) # => false\n\n# Test with a Truck\ntruck = Truck()\nispersonal(truck) # => false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,437],"elapsed":10.460027149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
