The `ispersonal` function takes a single argument of type `AbstractVehicle` and returns a Boolean indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.\n\nThe function first checks if the input vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, which are the two personal vehicles that we're interested in. If it is, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with an instance of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, like this:\n```\njulia> vehicle = Car()\nCar\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,298],"elapsed":7.175656829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
