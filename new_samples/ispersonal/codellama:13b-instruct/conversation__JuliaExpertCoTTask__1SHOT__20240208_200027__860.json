All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how the `ispersonal` function could be implemented:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `isa` operator to check if the provided vehicle is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. It returns true in these cases, and false otherwise. The default behavior for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` can be handled by using the `else` keyword.\n\nHere's an example of how this function could be used:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,289],"elapsed":7.114703956,"_type":"aimessage"}]
