[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

The function returns `true` if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle (i.e., either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`), and `false` otherwise.\n\nWe define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, which serves as the parent type for all vehicles in our program. We then define concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, such as `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. These subtypes each have their own unique properties and methods, but they all share the same `ispersonal` method.\n\nThe implementation of the `ispersonal` function is straightforward: we return `true` if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. This is achieved by using the `in` operator, which checks whether an object is contained in a collection of objects. In this case, we check whether the vehicle is contained in the collection `[Car, Motorcycle]`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\njulia> v = Car()\nCar(; ...)\n\njulia> ispersonal(v)\ntrue\n\njulia> v = Bus()\nBus(; ...)\n\njulia> ispersonal(v)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[421,428],"elapsed":10.740711122,"_type":"aimessage"}]
