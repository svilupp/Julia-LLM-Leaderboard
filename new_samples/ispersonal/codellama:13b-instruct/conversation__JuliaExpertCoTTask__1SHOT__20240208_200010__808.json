All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function uses the `isa` keyword to check if the vehicle is of type `Union{Car, Motorcycle}` (i.e., a personal vehicle). If it is, then the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\n# Testing the ispersonal function with different vehicles\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,307],"elapsed":7.549376472,"_type":"aimessage"}]
