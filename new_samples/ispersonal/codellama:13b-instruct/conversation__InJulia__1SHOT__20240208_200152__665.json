If it is, then the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. The default case where the vehicle is not a personal vehicle is handled by returning false.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # prints true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # prints false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # prints false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,305],"elapsed":7.31610635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
