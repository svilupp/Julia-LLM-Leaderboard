All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return (v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle) ? true : false\nend\n```\nThis function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input, checks if it's a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if so. If the vehicle is not a personal vehicle (i.e., it's a bus or truck), then the function returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nv = Car() # create a new Car instance\nispersonal(v) # => true\n\nv = Bus() # create a new Bus instance\nispersonal(v) # => false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[159,242],"elapsed":5.887447392,"_type":"aimessage"}]
