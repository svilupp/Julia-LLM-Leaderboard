All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` is defined for all subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, but it returns `false` by default. It also has specialized methods for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, which return `true`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\njulia> vehicle = Car()\nCar(<#0x0000000194861230>)\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,302],"elapsed":7.424928827,"_type":"aimessage"}]
