All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if typeof(v) in [Car, Motorcycle]\n        return true\n    elseif typeof(v) in [Bus, Truck]\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks the type of the `AbstractVehicle` instance passed as an argument and returns `true` if it is a personal vehicle (i.e., either `Car` or `Motorcycle`), and `false` otherwise. The function also includes a default case where any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` will return `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nv1 = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(v1)) # true\n\nv2 = Motorcycle()\nprintln(ispersonal(v2)) # true\n\nv3 = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(v3)) # false\n\nv4 = Truck()\nprintln(ispersonal(v4)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,307],"elapsed":7.362577785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
