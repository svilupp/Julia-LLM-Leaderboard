[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* `is<Type>` syntax to check if an object is a specific type, e.g., `isCar` or `isMotorcycle`.\n\t* `::` type annotation to specify the expected return type of a function.\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a trait called `PersonalVehicle` and define it as an abstract type.\n\t* Create functions for each vehicle type that check if they are personal vehicles, returning `true` or `false` based on their definition. For example:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Run tests to ensure that the function works correctly for all vehicle types, returning `true` or `false` as expected.\n\t* Review the code and make sure it is efficient, readable, and adheres to good programming practices.\n4. Provide an example of how to use the function:\n```julia\nusing Vehicles\n\nfunction main()\n    vehicle = Car(; make=\"Toyota\", model=\"Corolla\")\n    println(\"Is $(vehicle) a personal vehicle? $(ispersonal(vehicle))\")  # Output: Is Toyota Corolla a personal vehicle? true\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[424,356],"elapsed":9.047185781,"_type":"aimessage"}]
