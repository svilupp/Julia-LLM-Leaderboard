All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `ispersonal` function should return `true` if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, and `false` otherwise. Based on the description, we can infer that personal vehicles are `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and any other type of vehicle not listed as a commercial vehicle (i.e., `Bus`, `Truck`).\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nstruct AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return typeof(vehicle) in (Car, Motorcycle) ? true : false\nend\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vehicle is personal or not. We use the `typeof` operator to check the type of the `vehicle` argument and return `true` if it's either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`. For any other types, we return `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\n# Create a Car instance\ncar = Car()\n\n# Check if car is personal\nispersonal(car)  # => true\n\n# Create a Bus instance\nbus = Bus()\n\n# Check if bus is personal\nispersonal(bus)  # => false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,383],"elapsed":9.338786928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
