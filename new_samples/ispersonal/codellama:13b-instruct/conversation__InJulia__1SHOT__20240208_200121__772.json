If it is, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. This will work for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, including `Bus` and `Truck`, which will return `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nvehicle = Car() # or Motorcycle() or Bus() or Truck()\nispersonal(vehicle) # returns true for Cars and Motorcycles, false for Buses and Trucks\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,199],"elapsed":4.834154355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
