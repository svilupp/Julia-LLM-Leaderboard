[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns a `Bool` indicating whether the vehicle is personal or not.\n\nThe function works by checking if the vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns `true`. If the vehicle is an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. Finally, for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false` by default.\n\nWe then provide an example usage of the function with different vehicles and print their results to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[424,476],"elapsed":11.912804438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
