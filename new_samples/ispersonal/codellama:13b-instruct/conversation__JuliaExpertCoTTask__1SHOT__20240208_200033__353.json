All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If your implementation differs in some way, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.\n\nAs for an example, here's how you might use this function:\n```julia\n# Create a new vehicle object\nmy_car = Car()\n\n# Test whether it's personal with our `ispersonal` function\nis_personal = ispersonal(my_car)\n\n# Print the result\nprintln(\"Is my car personal? $is_personal\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,236],"elapsed":5.883726826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
