All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n    return vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `isa` function to check if the provided vehicle is an instance of the `Car` or `Motorcycle` types, and returns `true` in that case. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it returns `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nvehicles = [Car(), Motorcycle(), Bus(), Truck()]\nfor vehicle in vehicles\n    println(ispersonal(vehicle)) # true, true, false, false\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[159,228],"elapsed":5.553797147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
