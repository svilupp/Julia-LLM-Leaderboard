The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it is, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```\njulia> vehicle = Car(100, \"Red\", 4)\nCar(100, \"Red\", 4)\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\ntrue\n\njulia> vehicle = Bus(20, \"Blue\", 6)\nBus(20, \"Blue\", 6)\n\njulia> ispersonal(vehicle)\nfalse\n```\nIn this example, the first `vehicle` object is a personal vehicle (Car), so the function returns true. The second `vehicle` object is not a personal vehicle (Bus), so the function returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[121,280],"elapsed":6.734687345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
