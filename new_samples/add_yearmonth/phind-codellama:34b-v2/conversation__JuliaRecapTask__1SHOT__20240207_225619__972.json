[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We need to create a new function `add_yearmonth` that adds a new column to the DataFrame. Here is how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(row -> row[:dt].year * 100 + row[:dt].month, eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes as input a DataFrame and adds a new column `:ym` to it. The new column is created by using the `map` function on every row of the dataframe (`eachrow(df)`). For each row, we extract the year and month from the DateTime object in the `:dt` column, multiply the year by 100, add the month, and store this as the value for the new `:ym` column for that row.\n\nNote: Before running the function, ensure you have installed DataFrames package using the following command in REPL:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,268],"elapsed":6.884804748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
