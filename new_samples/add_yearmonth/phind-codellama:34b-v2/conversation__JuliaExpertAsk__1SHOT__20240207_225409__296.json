The function being mapped creates an integer by concatenating the year and month extracted from each DateTime entry. Note that this function modifies the input DataFrame in place (notice the exclamation mark in the end of the function name).\n\nYou can use it as follows:\n```julia\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(2017, 5, 1), Date(2018, 6, 1)])\n\n# Call the function to add the new column\nadd_yearmonth!(df)\n```\nThe resulting `df` DataFrame will have an additional `ym` column with values `[201705, 201806]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":7.641572427,"_type":"aimessage"}]
