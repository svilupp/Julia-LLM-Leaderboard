[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We will also need to use Dates package for operations on dates. \n\nHere is how we can implement `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[\"ym\"] = map(Dates.yearmonth, df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we are using the `map` function to apply `Dates.yearmonth` function on each element of the `:dt` column. The result is a vector that we add as a new column `:ym` in the DataFrame `df`.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\n# Create an example DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(\"2019-01-01\"), Date(\"2020-02-01\")])\n\n# Add the new column with year and month\nadd_yearmonth!(df)\n```\n\nAfter executing this code, `df` will have an additional column `:ym` containing year and month as integers in format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":7.116902493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
