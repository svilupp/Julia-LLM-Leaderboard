It uses the `map` function and `Dates.yearmonth` to create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`. The function `Dates.yearmonth` combines the year and month of the `DateTime` values in column `dt`, producing a single integer in format \"yyyymm\". Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that your DataFrame `df` already has a column called `dt` of type `DateTime`. If the DataFrame does not have such a column or if you need to convert a column to DateTime before calling `add_yearmonth`, additional steps may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":6.070610098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
