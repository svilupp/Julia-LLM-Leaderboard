Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this using the DataFramesMeta package which allows for easy manipulation of DataFrame columns with functions. If you don't have it installed, you can add it by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"DataFramesMeta\")` in the REPL.\n\nHere is a function that does what you're asking:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFramesMeta, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    @transform!(df, :ym = parse.(Int, string.(:dt))) do dtval\n        month = Dates.month(dtval)\n        year = Dates.year(dtval)\n        return \"$year$month\"\n    end\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `@transform!` macro from DataFramesMeta to add a new column `ym`. The `do` block allows for multiple operations on the DateTime value in `dt`. Here, it's used to extract the year and month with `Dates.year()` and `Dates.month()`, respectively, concatenate them as strings, and then parse that string into an integer to store in `ym`. The transformed DataFrame is returned at the end of the function.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTime values. If it's possible for these to be something other than a DateTime (e.g., missing or another type), you should add appropriate error handling and/or conversions before attempting to extract the year and month.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":8.334927362,"_type":"aimessage"}]
