Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing DataFrames\nimport Dates.YearMonth\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:, :ym] = map(Dates.Date, df[:dt]) .|> Dates.YearMonth |> YearMonth.(Int)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` and creates a new column `:ym`. The new column is created by first converting the `:dt` column to a `Date`, then extracting the `YearMonth`, and finally converting that to an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Note that this operation modifies `df` directly. If you would prefer not to modify the input DataFrame, you can make a copy of it inside the function.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that `:dt` column elements are convertible to Dates using the `Dates.Date` constructor. You need to have the `DataFrames` and `Dates` packages loaded for this code to work.","status":200,"tokens":[0,214],"elapsed":5.376422223,"_type":"aimessage"}]
