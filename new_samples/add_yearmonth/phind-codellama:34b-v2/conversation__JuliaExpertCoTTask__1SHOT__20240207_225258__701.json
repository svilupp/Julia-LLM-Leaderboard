Inside the function, I used the `map` function to apply a customized operation — extracting year and month from each DateTime entry in `dt` column — to every element in it. The extracted year and month are concatenated into a string without any delimiter and then parsed back into integers before being assigned to a new column `ym`. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":6.202421209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
