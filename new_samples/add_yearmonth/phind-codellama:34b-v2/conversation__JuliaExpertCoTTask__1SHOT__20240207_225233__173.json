Here's how you would do it:\n\n- First, create a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input.\n- Next, use the `broadcast` function to create a new column `ym` in your DataFrame. This new column will contain the year and month from the `dt` column, formatted as \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere's how you would write this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = broadcast(x -> parse(Int, Dates.format(x, \"yyyymm\")), df.dt)\nend\n\n# Test the function on your example data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will modify the original DataFrame `df` by adding a new column `ym`, which contains the year and month from each date in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,271],"elapsed":6.893750806,"_type":"aimessage"}]
