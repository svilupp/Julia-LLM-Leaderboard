The transformation is a function that takes a DateTime object, extracts its year and month with the Dates.year and Dates.month functions respectively, converts them into strings and concatenates them together.\n\n- Let's now create an example DataFrame and apply our function to it:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe function will add a new column to the dataframe with the specified format. You can check it by printing df:\n\n```julia\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nYou should see the original DataFrame with an additional `ym` column containing strings of format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":9.036896959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
