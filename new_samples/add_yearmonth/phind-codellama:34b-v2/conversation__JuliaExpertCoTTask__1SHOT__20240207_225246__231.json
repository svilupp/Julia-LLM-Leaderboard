This transformation extracts year and month from the DateTime object using Dates functions `Dates.year` and `Dates.month`, converts them to strings, and concatenates them together.\n- The result is assigned back into the DataFrame under the new column name `ym`.\n- Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":6.688208645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
