(YEAR(df[:, \"dt\"]) * 100 + MONTH(df[:, \"dt\"])))\n    df[:, \"ym\"] = string(yr_mo)\n    df\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by calling `add_yearmonth(df)` on your DataFrame `df` with a column named `dt`. It will then create a new column called `ym` that contains the year and month concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". \n\nNote: This code uses Julia's built-in functions `YEAR` and `MONTH` to extract the year and month from the datetime column, respectively. The multiplication with `100` is done to ensure that the two digits of the year always come first in the final string format, even for years less than 100.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":45.753987409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
