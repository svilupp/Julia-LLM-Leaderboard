The reason for multiplying the year by 100 is to ensure that the month (which only has two digits) will be correctly padded with leading zeros when concatenated as a string.\n# - Finally, we use the `[:, :]` indexing syntax to insert this new column into the original dataframe at the end and return it for convenience.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":42.05473336,"_type":"aimessage"}]
