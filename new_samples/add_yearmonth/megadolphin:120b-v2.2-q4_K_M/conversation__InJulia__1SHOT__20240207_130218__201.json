Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, you can use the following Julia code to create the `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    yr_mo = Dates.format.(df.dt, \"yymm\")\n    return rename!(setcolumn!(df, :ym => yr_mo), :ym => Symbol(\"yyyymm\"))\nend\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Inside the function, create an intermediate variable `yr_mo` by using Dates.format to extract the year and month from each date in column `dt` and format them as \"yyymm\", where \"y\" represents the year without the century (00-99), and \"m\" represents the month with a leading zero (01-12).\n\n2. Next, create a new column in the DataFrame called 'ym' by using setcolumn! to replace any existing column named 'ym' or add a new one if it doesn't exist. The new column's values are assigned from the `yr_mo` vector.\n\n3. Finally, use rename! to change the name of the newly added column 'ym' to 'yyyymm', which is more descriptive.\n\n4. Lastly, return the updated DataFrame with the new column 'yyyymm'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":62.896674929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
