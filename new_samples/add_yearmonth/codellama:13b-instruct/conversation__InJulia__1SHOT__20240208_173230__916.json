The resulting year-month combination is then concatenated into an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame by passing it as an argument: `add_yearmonth(df)`. This will add a new column named \"ym\" to your DataFrame with the desired values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":4.549831101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
