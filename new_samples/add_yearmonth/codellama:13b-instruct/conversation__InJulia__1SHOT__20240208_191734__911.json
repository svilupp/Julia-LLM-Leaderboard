The resulting year and month values are then concatenated together into a new column called `ym`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `dt` column is already present in the DataFrame and that it contains valid DateTimes. If the column does not exist or if the data is not in a valid DateTime format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[90,199],"elapsed":4.823735609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
