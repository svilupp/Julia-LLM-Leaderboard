[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We then define the function `add_yearmonth`, which takes a DataFrame `df` as an argument and returns a new DataFrame with a column `ym`. The first line of the function creates a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it, and the second line uses a list comprehension to iterate over the values in the `dt` column and create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from each value using the `Dates.format()` method with the format string \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime.(2018, 1, 1:31))\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with two columns: `dt` and `ym`, where the values in the `ym` column are the year and month extracted from the corresponding value in the `dt` column.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input DataFrame has a column named `dt` containing DateTimes. If your DataFrame does not have such a column, you can modify the function to extract the desired information from another column or use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[394,446],"elapsed":11.191340219,"_type":"aimessage"}]
