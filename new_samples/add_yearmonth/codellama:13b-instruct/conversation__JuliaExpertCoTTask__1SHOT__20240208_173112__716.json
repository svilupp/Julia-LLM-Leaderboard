We define a new function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. Inside the function, we extract the year and month from the `dt` column using the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module.\n3. We use `lpad` to add leading zeros to the month if necessary (e.g., \"5\" becomes \"05\").\n4. We concatenate the year and month using the `string` function, which converts them to strings.\n5. Finally, we assign the new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df`.\n\nNote: The `@.` macro is used to broadcast the functions over the columns of the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[257,224],"elapsed":12.693850928,"_type":"aimessage"}]
