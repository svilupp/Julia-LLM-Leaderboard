The resulting values are then concatenated together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `:dt` column contains DateTimes, and will throw an error if it does not. If you want to handle different types of columns, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[90,179],"elapsed":4.318689678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
