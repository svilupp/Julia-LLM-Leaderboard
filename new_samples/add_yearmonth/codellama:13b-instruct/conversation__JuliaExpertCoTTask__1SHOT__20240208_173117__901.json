We first create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.\n2. We use the `@.` macro to apply the `string` function to each element of the `dt` column, which returns a string representing the year and month of the date.\n3. We concatenate the year and month strings using `*` and assign them to the new `ym` column.\n4. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,155],"elapsed":3.722643098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
