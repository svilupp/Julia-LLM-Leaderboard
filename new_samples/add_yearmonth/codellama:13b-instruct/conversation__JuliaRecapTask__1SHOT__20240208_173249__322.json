[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The function uses the `Dates` module to extract year and month from a DateTime column.\n2. The function creates a new column named \"ym\" by concatenating the extracted year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n3. The solution is written using the standard Julia libraries, such as `using Dates`, and avoids new packages unless explicitly requested.\n4. The solution emphasizes performance, clarity, and abstract types where appropriate, while prioritizing readability and maintainability.\n5. The solution follows the reserved names for Julia keywords, such as \"begin\" and \"end\", and distinguishes itself from Python with 1-based indexing and multiple dispatch.","status":200,"tokens":[383,246],"elapsed":6.501711639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
