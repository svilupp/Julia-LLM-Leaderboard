[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Firstly, we import the `Dates` module to use its functions for working with date and time values.\n2. We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input and returns a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym`. The input column `dt` is also passed as argument, but it's not used directly in the function body. Instead, we use its name to create a new column `ym`.\n3. Inside the function, we use `map` to apply a custom function to each value of the `dt` column. The function takes a single DateTime value and returns a string with the year and month extracted from it using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions.\n4. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df` with the new `ym` column.\n\nNote that we use the `!` notation to indicate that we want to add a new column to the DataFrame instead of modifying an existing one. This is because `map` returns a vector of values, and we want to assign these values to a new column in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":8.386945389,"_type":"aimessage"}]
