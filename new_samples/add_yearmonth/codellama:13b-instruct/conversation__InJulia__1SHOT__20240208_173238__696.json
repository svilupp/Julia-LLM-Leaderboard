The `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame `df` with a column `dt` representing DateTimes as input and returns a new DataFrame with the same columns plus an additional column called `ym`. The values in the `ym` column are created by extracting year and month from the values in `dt` and concatenating them together as integers in format \"yyyymm\".\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> string(year(x), lpad(month(x), 2, '0')), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\nThe `map` function is used to iterate over the elements of the `dt` column and apply a function to each element. In this case, we are applying the `string` function which takes a DateTime object as input and returns a string representation of it in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\".\nThe `year` function is used to extract the year from the DateTime object. The `month` function is used to extract the month.\nWe then use the `lpad` function to add leading zeros to the month number if it has less than 2 digits, this is done to ensure that all values in the `ym` column have the same format and length.\nFinally we return the modified DataFrame with an additional column called `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":7.648514052,"_type":"aimessage"}]
