The year and month are then concatenated into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and stored in the new column `:ym`.\n\nIt's important to note that this function assumes that the `dt` column is of type Date, if it's not you will need to convert it before using this function.","status":200,"tokens":[82,181],"elapsed":4.44628831,"_type":"aimessage"}]
