The lambda function takes a DateTime object and extracts the year and month from it using the `year` and `month` methods, respectively. It then concatenates them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" using string interpolation. Finally, it assigns this value to a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[257,157],"elapsed":4.059208131,"_type":"aimessage"}]
