The `@.` macro is used to broadcast the operations over all rows of the DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the `df` DataFrame with the extracted year and month values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,186],"elapsed":4.437022726,"_type":"aimessage"}]
