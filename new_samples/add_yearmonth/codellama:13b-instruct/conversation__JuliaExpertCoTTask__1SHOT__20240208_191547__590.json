The `Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\")` function returns a string representation of the date in the format \"yyyyMM\".\n* We then assign this result to a new column called `ym` in the `df` DataFrame.\n* Finally, we return the updated DataFrame with the added `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[257,174],"elapsed":12.380388194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
