Then, it loops through each row of the DataFrame and extracts the year and month from the `dt` column using the `yearmonth()` function. It then concatenates the year and month values together as integers in the format \"yyyymm\" and stores them in the corresponding index of the `ym` array. Finally, it creates a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame and assigns the values from the `ym` array to this column.\n\nYou can call this function with the following code:\n```\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":5.867278973,"_type":"aimessage"}]
