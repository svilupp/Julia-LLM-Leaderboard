In this column, we store the year and month from the `dt` column as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". This can be done using the `year` and `month` functions available for DateTime elements in Julia.\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = [Dates.year(x)*100 + Dates.month(x) for x in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\nStep 3: Call the function on DataFrame `df`.\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe function will add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame `df` and it will contain the year and month from each DateTime entry in the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":8.209226688,"_type":"aimessage"}]
