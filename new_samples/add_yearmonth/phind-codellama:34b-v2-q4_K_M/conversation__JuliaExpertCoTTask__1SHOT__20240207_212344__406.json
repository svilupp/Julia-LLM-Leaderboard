It uses the map function from Julia's base library to apply the following anonymous function to each element in the `dt` column of the DataFrame: \n\n- The anonymous function converts a DateTime value `x` to a string by combining Dates.year and Dates.month functions, which extract year and month from `x`, respectively.\n- It then parses the resulting string as an integer, giving the desired \"yyyymm\" format. \n\nThe map function applies this anonymous function elementwise to the `dt` column of the DataFrame, producing a new array that it assigns to the new `ym` column. The modified DataFrame is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":8.633149186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
