Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve the problem with Julia's DataFrames.jl package which provides the necessary tools to handle data. Here is a function that does what you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = map(row -> row[:dt].year*100 + row[:dt].month, eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n\n# Test the function with a sample DataFrame\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [Date(\"2022-01-15\"), Date(\"2022-02-16\"), Date(\"2023-03-17\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nIn this function, we loop through each row of the DataFrame and for each DateTime `dt`, we extract year and month. We multiply year by 100 and add month to get \"yyyymm\". This number is assigned to a new column `ym`. After looping through all rows, our DataFrame will have an additional column `ym` with the desired values.\n\nYou can test this function using a sample DataFrame as shown in the example above.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.29929586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
