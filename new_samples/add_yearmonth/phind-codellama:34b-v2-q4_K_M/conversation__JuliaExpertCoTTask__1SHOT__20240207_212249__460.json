The values in this new column are constructed by extracting the year and month from the corresponding entry in the `dt` column, converting them into strings, concatenating these strings together, and then parsing this string as an integer. This results in a \"yyyymm\" format integer that represents the year and month of the original DateTime. The DataFrame with the new column is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[260,236],"elapsed":34.81484691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
