Here's how you could define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :dt] = Dates.DateTime.(df[!, :dt])  # Ensure dt column is of DateTime type\n    df[!, :ym] = map(row -> row[:dt].year*100 + row[:dt].month, eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function works by mapping over each row in the DataFrame and extracting the year and month from the DateTime object, then multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month to create the desired \"yyyymm\" integer. These integers are then stored in a new column `:ym`. If the `:dt` column is not already of DateTime type, the function will first convert it to DateTime format.\n\nAfter defining this function, you can apply it to your DataFrame:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,239],"elapsed":6.658708354,"_type":"aimessage"}]
