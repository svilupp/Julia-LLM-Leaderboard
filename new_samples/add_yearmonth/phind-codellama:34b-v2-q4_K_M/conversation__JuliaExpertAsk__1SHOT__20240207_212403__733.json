Then, you can use the `string` function and `parse` function to convert them into an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere is the code for your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nimport Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df.dt = Dates.DateTime.(df.dt)  # Ensure dt column is of DateTime type\n    df.ym = parse.(Int, string.(Dates.year(df.dt), Dates.month(df.dt)))\nend\n```\n\nThis function modifies the input DataFrame `df` by adding a new column `ym`. It first ensures that the `dt` column is of DateTime type (if it's not already). Then it creates the `ym` column by concatenating year and month from `dt`, converts the result into an integer, and adds this to every row of the DataFrame.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [\"2019-03-14\", \"2020-05-21\"])\nadd_yearmonth!(df)\n```\nThe resulting `df` will have a new column, `ym`, with the values [201903, 202005].","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":8.72412434,"_type":"aimessage"}]
