Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create the function `add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)` as follows. This function creates a new column `ym` that is the concatenation of the year and month from the `dt` column. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(Row -> Row.dt.year*100 + Row.dt.month, eachrow(df))\n    return df\nend\n\n# Test the function\ndt = Date(\"2020-03-15\")\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [dt])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `map` applies a function to each row of the dataframe `df`. The function takes a row and constructs a new number by multiplying the year part of the date in the `dt` column by 100 (to keep the year as four digits) and then adding the month part. This creates a \"yyyymm\"-like integer, which is stored in the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":6.847530184,"_type":"aimessage"}]
