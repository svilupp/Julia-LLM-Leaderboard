[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Then define your function add_yearmonth which does the following:\n- Extract year and month from `dt` using the Dates standard library.\n- Create a new column in the DataFrame by concatenating year and month into a single integer.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> parse(Int, string(Dates.year(x)) * string(Dates.month(x))), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing in a DataFrame with a `dt` column of DateTimes:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = DateTime[Date(2019, 1, 1), Date(2019, 2, 1), Date(2018, 12, 31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with the original `dt` column and an additional `ym` column containing the year and month as an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":7.798436837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
