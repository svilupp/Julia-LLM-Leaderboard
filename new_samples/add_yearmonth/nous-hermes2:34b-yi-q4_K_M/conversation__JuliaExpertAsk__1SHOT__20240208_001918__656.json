Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, colname::Symbol)\n    new_col = [parse.(Int, string.(DateTime(x).value)) for x in df[!, colname]]\n    return vcat(df, DataFrame([\"yyyymm\"] => new_col))\nend\n```\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe `add_yearmonth` function takes two arguments: a DataFrame (`df`) and the name of the column from which to extract year and month (`colname`). It creates a new column called \"yyyymm\" by extracting the year and month components from each element in the input column, using the `DateTime` type's `value` property for more convenient manipulation. \n\nThe function uses list comprehension and `string` to convert the `DateTime` values into strings that can be parsed as integers. The resulting array of integer years and months is then used to create a new DataFrame with the desired \"yyyymm\" column, which is concatenated with the original DataFrame using `vcat`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":7.020322455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
