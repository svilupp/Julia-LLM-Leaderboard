If not, it throws an error. Then it creates a new vector called `ym` which contains the concatenation of the year and month as integers in the format \"yyyymm\" (e.g., 201912 for December 2019). Finally, it uses Julia's `select!` function to add this new column to the DataFrame without modifying the original one, using a renaming rule to give it the name \"yearmonth\" with alias \"ym\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,266],"elapsed":7.72995639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
