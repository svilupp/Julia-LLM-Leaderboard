It uses the `mapreduce()` function to apply the following steps:\n1. Extracts year and month from each element of the `dt` column.\n2. Converts them into strings using the `string()` function.\n3. Pads the month number with zeroes to ensure a consistent length of 2 digits, using the `lpad()` function.\n4. Concatenates the year and padded month together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n5. Returns the new column value as a vector, along with the renamed symbol for the new column, which has the same name as the original column but appended with `_ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":7.407201862,"_type":"aimessage"}]
