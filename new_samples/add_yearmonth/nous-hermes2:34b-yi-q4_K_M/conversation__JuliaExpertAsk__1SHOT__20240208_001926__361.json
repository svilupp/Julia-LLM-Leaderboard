The transformation function uses `year()` and `month()` functions from Julia's built-in Dates module. It then constructs a string representing the year and month concatenated together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n- `string(@sprintf(\"%04d%02d\", year(x), month(x)))` is used to construct the string with leading zeros for 4-digit years and 2-digit months.\n- The resulting column `ym` is then added to the DataFrame using `df[:ym] = result`","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":7.780537701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
