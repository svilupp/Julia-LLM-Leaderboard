Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can use the `DateTime` type to manipulate date and time values. To extract the year and month from a `DateTime` object, we can simply access the attributes directly, like so:\n```julia\nyear = dt.year\nmonth = dt.month\n```\nTo concatenate them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\", we need to convert them to strings and then join them with a string representation of the year. Here's one way to do it:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = join([string(x.year, \"%02d\", x.month) for x in eachrow(df)], \"\")\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over each row of the DataFrame and extracts the year and month attributes from the `DateTime` object stored in the `dt` column. It then converts them to strings using the `string()` function and joins them together with a string representation of the year, using the format \"%02d\" for zero-padded two-digit numbers. Finally, it adds this new column to the DataFrame and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,259],"elapsed":7.531197736,"_type":"aimessage"}]
