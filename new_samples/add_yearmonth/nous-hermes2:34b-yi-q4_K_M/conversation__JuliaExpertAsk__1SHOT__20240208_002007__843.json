Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    @assert haskey(names(df), :dt) \"Date column not found\"\n\n    df[!, :ym] = map(x -> string(x.value.year * 100 + x.value.month), df[:, :dt])\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `ym` which is created by extracting year and month from the existing date column (`:dt`). The extracted values are then concatenated together to form an integer in the format \"yyyymm\", where 'yy' represents the year, 'mm' represents the month. \n\nThe function uses a built-in Julia DataFrame iterator (e.g. `df[:, :dt]`) to iterate over each element of the date column and applies the extraction operation using the `map` function from the standard library. The `map` function iterates over each DateTime object in the `:dt` column and uses the `year` and `month` properties (e.g. `x.value.year`) to extract the respective values. These extracted values are then converted into a string representation by multiplying the year with 100, adding the month value, and converting the result back to an integer using string concatenation (`string(...)`).\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified DataFrame `df` containing the newly added column `ym` with the extracted year and month values in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":10.324356314,"_type":"aimessage"}]
