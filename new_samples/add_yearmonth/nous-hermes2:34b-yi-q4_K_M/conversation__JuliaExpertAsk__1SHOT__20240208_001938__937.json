Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = @. dtstr2int(string(dt)) # replace 'dt' with actual column name\nend\n\nfunction dtstr2int(str::AbstractString)\n    return parse(Int64, string(year(DateTime(str))*100 + month(DateTime(str))))\nend\n```\n\nIn the given solution, we define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes in a DataFrame `df` and adds a new column named `ym` to it. To do this, we utilize another helper function called `dtstr2int` which is responsible for converting the year and month from a string format into an integer format.\n\nThe `dtstr2int` function uses the `DateTime` type from Julia's built-in date-time library. It takes in a string (`str`) representing a date, parses it using `year(DateTime(str))` to get the year and `month(DateTime(str))` to get the month, and then multiplies the year by 100 and adds the month to create an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nIn our main function `add_yearmonth`, we use broadcasting (`@.`) syntax combined with string conversion (`string(dt)`) on each value of the `dt` column in the DataFrame `df`. We then call `dtstr2int` to convert these strings into integers and assign them to the new column `ym`.\n\nTo use this function, you would need to replace 'dt' with the actual name of your date-time column in the DataFrame, and it will create a new column named `ym` containing year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,398],"elapsed":11.621605667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
