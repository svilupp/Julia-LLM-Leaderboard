[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the Dates and DataFrames packages to solve this problem. Here is how you can create your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt]) # yyyy*100+mm\nend\n```\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as an argument and adds a new column named 'ym' to it. The values in this column are extracted from the 'dt' column using map function. For each DateTime value, we call year and month functions and concatenate them together by multiplying the year with 100 and then adding the month.\n\nNote: This assumes that your `df` is a DataFrame and you have a column named `dt` which holds DateTimes. If this isn't the case, you'll need to adjust your code accordingly. Also ensure that you are using Julia version 1.0 or later as earlier versions don't support the Dates module.","status":200,"tokens":[82,246],"elapsed":7.115915551,"_type":"aimessage"}]
