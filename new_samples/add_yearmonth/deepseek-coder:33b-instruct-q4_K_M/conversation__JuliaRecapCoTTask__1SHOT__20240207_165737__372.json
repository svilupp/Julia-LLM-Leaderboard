[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

You will need to extract the year and month from each datetime, convert these to strings, and then concatenate them together as required. Here is a function that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = string.(Year.(df[:dt]), lpad.(Month.(df[:dt]), 2, \"0\"))\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `Year` and `Month` are functions provided by the Dates package that extract year and month from a DateTime object respectively. The `lpad` function is used to ensure that months less than 10 have a leading zero. Finally, the `string` function is used to concatenate these strings together.\n\nPlease note that this function modifies its argument in-place by adding a new column named \"ym\". If you need it to return a new DataFrame instead of modifying the input one, simply replace `df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = ...` with `df[:ym] = ...` and return `df` at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":7.23935494,"_type":"aimessage"}]
