This column is created by mapping over the DateTime column `dt` in the input DataFrame. For each element in that column (which are DateTimes), it extracts the year and month, concatenates them together into a string with format “yyyymm”, and stores this string in the new column `ym`. The function then returns the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":4.929454103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
