Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"dt\")] = DateTime.(df[:dt]) # make sure dt is of type DateTime\n    df[:ym] = year.(df[:dt]) .* 100 .+ month.(df[:dt])\nend\n```\nIn this function, we're assuming that the `dt` column contains strings or anything that can be converted to a DateTime object. We then extract the year and month using the functions `year` and `month` respectively from the Dates package. \n\nWe concatenate them as an integer by multiplying the year by 100 (to shift it two places left, which is equivalent to shifting all previous digits one place right) and adding the month. This gives us the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nFinally, we assign this new column `ym` back to the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":6.562038183,"_type":"aimessage"}]
