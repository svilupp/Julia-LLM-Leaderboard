Here's how you could write your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> Year(Dates.year(x))*100 + Month(Dates.month(x)), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nHere we are using the `map` function to apply a function that takes an element of `df[:dt]`, extracts year and month components from it, then concatenate them into a single integer representing year and month. The result is assigned to `df[Symbol(\"ym\")]`. \n\nThis code assumes that you have already loaded the DataFrames and Dates packages using `using DataFrames, Dates` at the beginning of your script. Make sure to run it in Julia environment where these two packages are available.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":5.742786713,"_type":"aimessage"}]
