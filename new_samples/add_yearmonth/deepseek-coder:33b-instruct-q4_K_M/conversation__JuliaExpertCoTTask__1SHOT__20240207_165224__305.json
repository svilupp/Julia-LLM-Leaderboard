The `lpad.(string.(Dates.month.(df[:dt])), 2, \"0\")` pads month with zero if it's less than 10, so that we can get a two-digit number for the month.\n- We are using string interpolation to concatenate year and month together in a way that makes sense (i.e., as an integer). \n- The `df` is passed into the function `add_yearmonth` and after executing this, we will have a new column `ym` in our DataFrame `df` with the required information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":11.27134263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
