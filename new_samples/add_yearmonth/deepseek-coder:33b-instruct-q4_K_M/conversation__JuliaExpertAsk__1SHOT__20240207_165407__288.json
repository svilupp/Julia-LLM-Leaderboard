Here is a function that does this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = string.(Year.(df[:dt]), lpad.(Month.(df[:dt]), 2, \"0\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the `DateTime` column to a year and month using the `Year` and `Month` functions from the `Dates` package. It then converts these to strings, pads the month with zeros if necessary (to ensure it is always 2 digits), and concatenates them together with a `-` in between. This creates a string in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,172],"elapsed":4.86283054,"_type":"aimessage"}]
