If your dates are in different format or stored differently, you might need to adjust this code accordingly. \n\nAlso remember that Julia uses the Dates package for working with date and time data types, so make sure it's installed if you haven't done so already (`Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":6.92365025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
