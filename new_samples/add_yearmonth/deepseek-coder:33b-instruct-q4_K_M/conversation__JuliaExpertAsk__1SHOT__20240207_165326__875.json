Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> parse(Int, format(Dates.firstdayofmonth(DateTime(x)), \"yyyymm\")), df[:dt])\nend\n```\nThis function will iterate over each DateTime in `df` and use the `format` function from Dates package to extract year and month as an integer. It then adds this new column of integers to your DataFrame. \n\nNote that `Dates.firstdayofmonth(DateTime(x))` is used to ensure the day of the DateTime in `dt` is set to the first day of the month, before formatting it with the `format` function. If you want to keep the original day of the month, you can simply use `Dates.year(x)` and `Dates.month(x)` instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":6.742968599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
