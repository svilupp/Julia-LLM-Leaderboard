Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Dates` package to do this. Here is how you would add a function named `add_yearmonth` that accomplishes your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt)*100 .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` package are used to extract the year and month from the `dt` column. The `.*` operator is used to multiply the years by 100 before adding them to the months. This gives you an integer with the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nPlease note that this function will mutate your DataFrame, as it adds a new column named `ym` directly in the input DataFrame. If you don't want to modify the original DataFrame and prefer working on a copy instead, you should create a copy of the DataFrame inside the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df = copy(df)  # Create a copy of input DataFrame\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt)*100 .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":8.405508741,"_type":"aimessage"}]
