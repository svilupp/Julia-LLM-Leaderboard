We then concatenate them into string format \"yyyymm\". The `parse` function is used to convert this string back into an integer. This function modifies the original DataFrame by adding a new column 'ym'.\n\nNote: This assumes that your dates are in UTC timezone and you want the year-month information at the beginning of each month. If they're not, adjust accordingly. Also, note that this approach will truncate any day/time info from `dt`. \n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=DateTime.(2018:2020) .+ Year(1):Month(1):Year(1)) # creating a sample dataframe\nprintln(add_yearmonth(df))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":8.667351716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
