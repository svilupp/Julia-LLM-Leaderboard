Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = [parse(Int, Dates.format(dt, \"yyyymm\")) for dt in df[:dt]]\nend\n\n# create a dataframe with DateTimes\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThe `Dates.format` function is used to format the DateTimes in column 'dt' of df as \"yyyymm\". The resulting strings are then parsed back into integers and assigned to a new column 'ym'. \n\nPlease note that this will work if all DateTime values have both year and month specified, which seems to be the case from your example. If not, you might need to handle these cases differently based on what makes sense in your context. For instance, you could use `Dates.format` with a format string like \"yyyymm\" and then add a check for missing values or replace them with something else.","status":200,"tokens":[252,310],"elapsed":36.993601402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
