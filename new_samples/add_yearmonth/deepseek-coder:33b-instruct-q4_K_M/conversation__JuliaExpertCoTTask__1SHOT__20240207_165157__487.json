[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves your problem. I will use the DataFrames and Dates packages to achieve this.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> year(x)*100 + month(x), df[:dt])\nend\n\n# testing the function\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function works by mapping a lambda function to each element in the `dt` column of your DataFrame. The lambda function extracts year and month from the date, concatenates them together as an integer and stores it in a new column named `ym`. \n\nPlease note: if you have not installed these packages you may install them by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add([\"DataFrames\", \"Dates\"])` before running your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":7.295498748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
