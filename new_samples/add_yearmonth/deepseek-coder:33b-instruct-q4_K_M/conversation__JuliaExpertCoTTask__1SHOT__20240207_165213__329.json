The function uses the Dates package from Julia's standard library and the string interpolation feature ($):\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = year.(df[:dt]) .* 100 + month.(df[:dt])\nend\n\n# Test on the provided DataFrame:\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nPlease note that in Julia, the function `year` and `month` extracts the year and month components of a DateTime object respectively. The \".\" operator is used for elementwise operation on an array (vector), hence we use it to extract years and months from each DateTime in column `dt`. Finally, to concatenate year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\", we multiply the year by 100 and add the month.","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":7.539828339,"_type":"aimessage"}]
