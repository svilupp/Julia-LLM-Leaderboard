The resulting DataFrame is returned, with the new column `:ym` added to it.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes you have already imported the `Dates` module at the top of your script or have done so within the function itself before using any functions from this module. If not, please add this line at the beginning of your code: `using Dates`. \n\nAlso, make sure to replace \"dt\" with the actual name of your date column if it's different.","status":200,"tokens":[113,245],"elapsed":7.086255759,"_type":"aimessage"}]
