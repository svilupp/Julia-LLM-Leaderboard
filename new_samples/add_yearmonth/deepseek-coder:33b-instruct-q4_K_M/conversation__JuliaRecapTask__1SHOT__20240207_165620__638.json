[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

This function first extracts the year and month from each DateTime object, formats them as two digit strings (padding with zero if necessary), concatenates them together, and finally converts it back into an integer.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> parse(Int, string(Dates.year(x))) * 100 + parse(Int, lpad(string(Dates.month(x)),2,\"0\")) , df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `df` is a DataFrame and `dt` is the column name containing DateTimes. The new column `ym` will be created in place. \n\nRemember to add Dates package by using command `using Dates` if it has not been already used before calling this function. This package provides a host of functions for working with date and time data types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.537797186,"_type":"aimessage"}]
