The integers are then concatenated together into a string in the format \"yyyymm\". \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the DateTimes in column `dt` contain full dates (including day). If they only contain months or years, you might need to adjust the function accordingly.\n\nThe `lpad` function is used to ensure that month values with one digit are padded with a leading zero to meet the desired format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":6.483792197,"_type":"aimessage"}]
