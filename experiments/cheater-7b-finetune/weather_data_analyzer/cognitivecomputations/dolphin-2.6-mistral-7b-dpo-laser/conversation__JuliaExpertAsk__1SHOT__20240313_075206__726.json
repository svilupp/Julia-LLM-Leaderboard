Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, you can make use of the `Statistics` package in Julia. Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherAnalysis\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherAnalysis(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if isempty(temps)\n        trend = nothing\n        return WeatherAnalysis(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\n    end\n\n    temp_diff = diff(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(all(temp_diff .> 0), :increasing, \n                    all(temp_diff .< 0) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    return WeatherAnalysis(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a `WeatherAnalysis` named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n\nOtherwise, it calculates average, max, and min temperatures using the `Statistics` package. Then, it determines the trend of the temperatures by comparing the differences between consecutive temperatures in the list. If all differences are positive, it returns `:increasing`; if all differences are negative, it returns `:decreasing`; otherwise, it returns `:stable`. Finally, it returns the complete `WeatherAnalysis` named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[205,416],"elapsed":10.435212433,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-270153766,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
