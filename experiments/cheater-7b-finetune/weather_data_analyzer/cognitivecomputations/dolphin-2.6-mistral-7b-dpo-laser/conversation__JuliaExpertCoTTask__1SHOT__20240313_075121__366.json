Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, include the `Statistics` package with `using Statistics` at the top of your script.\n\nFor the function definition, you can use the `NamedTuple` type to create a named tuple that contains the desired statistical results. The `trend` field will be either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on the comparison of successive temperatures.\n\nHere is the code that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\n# Define a named tuple to hold the results\nstruct WeatherData\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\n# Function to analyze weather data\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    diffs = diff(temps)\n    is_increasing = all(diffs .> 0)\n    is_decreasing = all(diffs .< 0)\n\n    if is_increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif is_decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return WeatherData(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will return a `WeatherData` named tuple with the requested statistical information. If the input list is empty, it will return all fields as `nothing`. The trend will be classified as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on the comparison of successive temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[301,435],"elapsed":10.956443014,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":354247533,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
