Recall the necessary Julia snippets that will be useful for this task.\n2. Solve the task by writing the `weather_data_analyzer` function.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n### Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task\n- Function definition: `function weather_data_analyzer(temps) end`\n- Importing the `Statistics` package to use statistical functions: `using Statistics`\n- Calculating the average temperature: `mean(temps)`\n- Finding the maximum and minimum temperatures: `maximum(temps)` and `minimum(temps)`\n- Checking the trend:\n  - Compare each day's temperature with the previous one\n  - If temperatures are strictly increasing, the trend is `:increasing`\n  - If temperatures are strictly decreasing, the trend is `:decreasing`\n  - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`\n\nNow, let's proceed to solve the task.\n\n### Solve the Task\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Check trend\n    trend = :stable\n    if all(t1 > t2 for (t1, t2) in zip(temps, drop(temps, 1)))\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(t1 < t2 for (t1, t2) in zip(temps, drop(temps, 1)))\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nLet's double-check that the solution is correct.\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n- The function correctly returns `nothing` for all results when the `temps` list is empty.\n- The average temperature is correctly calculated using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n- The maximum and minimum temperatures are correctly found using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions.\n- The trend is correctly identified as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` based on the comparison of consecutive days' temperatures.\n\nThis completes the solution to the task.","status":200,"tokens":[472,624],"elapsed":16.262866069,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":284923330,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
