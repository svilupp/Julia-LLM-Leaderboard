Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I will follow the below steps:\n\n1.

The trend is classified as `:increasing` if all temperatures are increasing, `:decreasing` if they are decreasing, and `:stable` otherwise. If the input list is empty, the function returns `nothing` for each key in the named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[301,414],"elapsed":10.654193092,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-943130033,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
