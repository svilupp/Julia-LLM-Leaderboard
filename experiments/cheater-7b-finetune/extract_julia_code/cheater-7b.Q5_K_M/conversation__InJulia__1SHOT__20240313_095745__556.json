It then filters out all code blocks with the language set to \"julia\", removes any code fences (triple backticks), and joins the remaining content together with newlines. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[105,235],"elapsed":2.843039488,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-605873869,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
