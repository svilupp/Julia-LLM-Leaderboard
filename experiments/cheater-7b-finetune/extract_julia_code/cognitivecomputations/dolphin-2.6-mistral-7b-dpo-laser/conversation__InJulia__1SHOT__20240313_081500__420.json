Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

If you want to handle those cases, you might need to adjust the regular expression used to extract the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[95,491],"elapsed":12.969682966,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-136829099,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
