[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = findall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    joined_code_blocks = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\n    return joined_code_blocks.trim()\nend\n```\n\nSteps for the function:\n1. Use a regular expression with `findall` function to find all occurrences of code fences with `julia` in `md`.\n2. Join all matched strings (code blocks) into a single string.\n3. Remove leading/trailing whitespaces by using the `trim` function.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input `md` is a string containing markdown text, and that the code blocks conform to the standard Julia code block syntax using three backticks (\"```julia\"), without any unwanted whitespace or different formatting. If these assumptions do not hold, the regex pattern might need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[401,230],"elapsed":6.263836127,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":357630376,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
