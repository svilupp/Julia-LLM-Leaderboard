[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's how we can accomplish this using Julia's native libraries:\n\nWe will utilize the following Julia packages:\n\n- `Markdown`: For markdown parsing\n- `TOML`: For reading the `md` file\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown, TOML\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(file_path::AbstractString)\n    \n    # Read the metadata from the toml file\n    metadata = TOML.parsefile(joinpath(dirname(file_path), \"..\", \"metadata.toml\"))\n\n    # Open the file, read its content and parse with Markdown\n    open(file_path) do file\n        md_content = read(file, String)\n        parsed_md = Markdown.parse(md_content)\n    \n        # Find all the code blocks\n        code_blocks = []\n        for node in parsed_md.content\n            if node.kind == :fence\n                if node.info[1] == \"`julia\"\n                    push!(code_blocks, node.value)\n                end\n            elseif node.kind == :code_block\n                if haskey(metadata, \"language\") && metadata[\"language\"] == \"julia\"\n                    push!(code_blocks, join(node.value, \"\\n\"))\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        \n        # Remove the code fences\n        cleaned_code_blocks = [code_block[2:end-1] for code_block in code_blocks]\n        \n        # Join the code blocks\n        extracted_code = join(cleaned_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n        \n        return extracted_code\n    end\n    \nend\n```\n\nBefore running this code, make sure to have the following directory structure:\n\n```bash\n.\n├── metadata.toml\n└── your_markdown_file.md\n```\n\nWhere `metadata.toml` contains the language information for the markdown file.\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function will return a string with all the code blocks from the given markdown file, without the initial and final code fence. If the code fences do not contain the specific string `\"julia\"`, the function will not consider them. In the same way, if the metadata file does not contain the key `\"language\"` nor the value `\"julia\"`, the function will skip the whole parsing process.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to adapt this script according to your specific use-case and the Markdown file structure that you're working with. This is just a general approach to the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[403,643],"elapsed":16.95903164,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":815559799,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
