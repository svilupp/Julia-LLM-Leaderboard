[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This function uses the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown file and extracts the code blocks with triple backticks.\n\nBefore you run the code, you need to install the `Markdown` package by running `] add Markdown`.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    code_blocks = []\n    for i in eachindex(doc.content)\n        if doc.content[i] isa InlineCode\n            push!(code_blocks, join(doc.content[i].content[i] for i in eachindex(doc.content[i].content) .!

Then it iterates over the contents of the document, checks if the content is an inline code or a fence. If it is an inline code, it extracts the content between the backticks. If it is a fence and the name of the fence is \"code\", it extracts the code blocks inside the fence and appends them to the list of code blocks. After extracting all the code blocks, it joins them with a newline and returns the result as a string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all code fences with the name \"code\" will contain Julia code. If there are code fences with other names or other content, you might need to modify the function to handle them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[403,485],"elapsed":12.186368514,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":513689243,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
