You could incorporate this function into a larger Markdown-processing pipeline, or possibly even use it in an interactive environment where you're reading in markdown documents piecemeal.\n\nRemember, this function assumes that the markdown document strictly follows the Julia code blocks syntax. For example, it expects every code block to be preceded by a line of three backticks (```), and it expects the code block to end with three backticks on a line by themselves.","status":200,"tokens":[95,504],"elapsed":12.502390485,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1814490859,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
