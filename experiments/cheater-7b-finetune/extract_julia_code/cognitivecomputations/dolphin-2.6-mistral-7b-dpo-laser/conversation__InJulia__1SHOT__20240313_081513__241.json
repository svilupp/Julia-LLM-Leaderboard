It iterates over each line, identifying and extracting code blocks. Note that this function doesn't handle nested code blocks or code blocks within other code blocks.\n\nTo use the function, you would call it like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code) # Output: \"println(\\\"Hello, world!\\\")\"\n\"\"\"","status":200,"tokens":[95,516],"elapsed":12.790569056,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1440238627,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
