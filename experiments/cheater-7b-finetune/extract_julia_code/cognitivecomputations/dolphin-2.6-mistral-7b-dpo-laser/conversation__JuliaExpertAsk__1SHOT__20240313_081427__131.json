It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. If no code blocks are present, it returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[136,190],"elapsed":4.705732663,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":194646755,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
