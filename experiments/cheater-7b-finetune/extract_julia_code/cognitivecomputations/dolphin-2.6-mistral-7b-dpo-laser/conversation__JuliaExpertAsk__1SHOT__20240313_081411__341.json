It splits the string at double newlines to extract the code blocks, then checks each block to see if it contains a Julia code fence (```julia```). If the block contains a code fence and another code fence at the end, it's considered a code block, and it adds it to the `code_blocks` list. Finally, it joins the code blocks together (removing the final newline from the last code block) and returns the joined code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[136,246],"elapsed":6.097955827,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1618567472,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
