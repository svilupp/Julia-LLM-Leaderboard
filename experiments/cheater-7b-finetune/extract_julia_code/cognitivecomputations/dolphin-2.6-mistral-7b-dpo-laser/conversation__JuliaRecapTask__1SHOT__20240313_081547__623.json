[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The `extract_julia_code` function can be defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    function handle_code_fence(node::Markdown.FencedCodeBlock)\n        push!(code_blocks, strip(node.content))\n    end\n\n    function process_node(node)\n        if typeof(node) == Markdown.FencedCodeBlock\n            handle_code_fence(node)\n        elseif typeof(node) == Markdown.Node\n            for child in node.children\n                process_node(child)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    process_node(doc)\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function parses the input Markdown string using the `Markdown.parse` function, which returns an abstract syntax tree (AST) as a `Block` object. The function `extract_julia_code` then recursively processes each node in this AST. If a node is a `FencedCodeBlock`, it calls the `handle_code_fence` function, which extracts the content of the code block and appends it to the `code_blocks` list.\n\nFinally, after processing all the nodes in the AST, the function returns a string formed by joining all the code blocks together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[401,372],"elapsed":9.372507174,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1387940598,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
