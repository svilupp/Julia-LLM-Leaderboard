If it is, it toggles the `in_julia_code_block` flag. When this flag is `true`, it adds the current line to the `julia_code_blocks` array. Finally, it joins the code blocks together with newline characters and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[95,309],"elapsed":7.822210615,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1369066965,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
