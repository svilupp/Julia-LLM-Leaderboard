Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this by using regular expressions in Julia. Here's the function `extract_julia_code` that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataStructures\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all code blocks within the markdown document\n    matches = match.(r\"```(.*?)```\", md)\n    \n    # Extract the actual code from the matched strings\n    codes = [match for match in matches if occursin(\"```\", match) && occursin(\"```\", match[end])]\n    codes = filter(c -> !isempty(c), codes)\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with newlines\n    joined_code = join(codes, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function first uses regular expressions to find all code blocks within the markdown document. It then filters out any blocks that don't have the ``` syntax and removes empty strings. Finally, it joins the remaining code blocks together with newlines and returns the result as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[136,254],"elapsed":6.432745091,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":28122140,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
