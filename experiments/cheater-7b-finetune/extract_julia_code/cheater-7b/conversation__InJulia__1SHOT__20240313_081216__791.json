It filters out only the code blocks that have the language attribute set to `:julia`. It then joins all the filtered code blocks with a newline character.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to have the `Markdown` package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not installed, you can add it to your environment using:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\npkg\"add Markdown\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[95,249],"elapsed":6.296666969,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1166102846,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
