Here is the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    doc = MD.parse(md)\n    filtered_cells = filter(cell -> occursin(r\"\\`\\``julia\\`\\``\", cell), doc.content)\n    if isempty(filtered_cells)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n    julia_code = join([filter(x -> occursin(r\"\\`\\``julia\\`\\``\", x), cell.content) for cell in filtered_cells], \"\\n\")\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown document into a Markdown.jl document object. It then filters out the cells where the code block language is specified as \"julia\". If there are no such cells, an empty string is returned. Otherwise, it extracts the code block content and joins them together with newlines.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is a string containing markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[95,259],"elapsed":7.291438471,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":339522045,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
