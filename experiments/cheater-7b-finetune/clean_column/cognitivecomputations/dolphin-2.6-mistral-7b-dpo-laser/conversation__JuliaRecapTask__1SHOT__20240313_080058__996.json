[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, you can use the Julia programming language. Here's a function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Clean the column name\n    cleaned_col = lowercase(strip(replace(col, \" \" => \"_\", r\"-\" => \"_\")))\n    return cleaned_col\nend\n```\n\nThis function firstly strips the leading and trailing whitespaces of the input using `strip()`. Then, it replaces all spaces and hyphens in the input with underscores using `replace()`. Finally, it converts the cleaned column name to lowercase using `lowercase()` and returns it. This function is typed to work with any AbstractString (such as String or SubString) and will produce another AbstractString.","status":200,"tokens":[388,183],"elapsed":4.966428037,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-836725581,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
