Then we define a `show` method for it that concatenates the value and unit with a space.\n\nNow we can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method allows us to print instances of `FloatWithUnits` in a formatted way, combining the value and unit with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[201,224],"elapsed":5.618312329,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-667820266,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
