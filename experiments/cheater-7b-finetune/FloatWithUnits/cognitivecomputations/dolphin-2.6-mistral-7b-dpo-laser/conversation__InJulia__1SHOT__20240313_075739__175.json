Here's how you can define a struct `FloatWithUnits` along with a `show` method that prints the value and unit separated by a space:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow, if you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, it will be displayed as \"1.8 meters\" (or other numbers and units depending on what you set in your instance):\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn the `show` method, we use `Base.show` function that is a part of the `Base` module, which is automatically included in every Julia script. The first argument is the `IO` type, which is the stream where the value will be printed. The second argument is the instance of your struct that you want to print. Inside the method, we simply print the value and unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[78,304],"elapsed":7.522474867,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2146931516,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
