It ensures that when you print a `FloatWithUnits` object, it shows the value and unit separated with a space. The `MIME\"text/plain\"` disambiguates the method for text rendering. The `print` function inside the `show` method prints the value and the unit separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[120,151],"elapsed":3.741687299,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1892273013,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
