Here's an example implementation of the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value\n    unit\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that takes an `IO` object and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as arguments. Inside the method, we use string interpolation to concatenate the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nYou can use this `show` method to display instances of `FloatWithUnits` in a way that includes both the value and the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[78,180],"elapsed":4.547861606,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-99421658,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
