Here's a code snippet that defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct along with the `show` method to concatenate the `value` and `unit` as you described:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`, and then provides a `show` method that formats the struct according to the specified output. When you run the example usage, it should print \"1.8 meters\" to the standard output.","status":200,"tokens":[78,193],"elapsed":4.8743714,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-305352447,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
