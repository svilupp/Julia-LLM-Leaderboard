Use the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from `dt`.\n2. Concatenate the extracted year and month with `string(year, \"0000\")` and `string(month, \"00\")` to form the desired format.\n3. Create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` and assign the values obtained in step 2 to it.\n\nHere is the Julia code that implements this approach:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] .= string(year.(df[:dt]), \"0000\", string(month.(df[:dt]), \"00\"))\n    return df\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nThis code first imports the necessary modules. Then it defines a function `add_yearmonth` that extracts the year and month from the `dt` column of the DataFrame `df` and concatenates them to create a new `ym` column. Finally, it creates a sample DataFrame `df` and applies the `add_yearmonth` function to it. The resulting DataFrame `df` is then printed.","status":200,"tokens":[255,387],"elapsed":9.687106166,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1542374915,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
