Here's a function `add_yearmonth` that does just that:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` `df` as an input, creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column, and concatenates them together as an integer in the specified format. The `year()` and `month()` functions from the `Dates` module are used to extract the year and month, respectively. The `.` operator is used for element-wise multiplication, and the `.+` operator is used for element-wise addition. Finally, the modified `DataFrame` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[86,235],"elapsed":5.932857602,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":6506199,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
