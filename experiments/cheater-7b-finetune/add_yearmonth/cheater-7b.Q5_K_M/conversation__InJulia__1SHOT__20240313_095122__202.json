Here's a function that should do what you described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = year.(df.dt) .* 100 .+ month.(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column, then concatenates them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". The `.` operator is used for element-wise multiplication and addition of arrays.\n\nYou can use this function by passing your DataFrame `df` to it:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df has a column named dt with DateTime values\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nAfter calling the `add_yearmonth` function, the new column `ym` will be added to your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[97,226],"elapsed":2.694256446,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1907191769,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
