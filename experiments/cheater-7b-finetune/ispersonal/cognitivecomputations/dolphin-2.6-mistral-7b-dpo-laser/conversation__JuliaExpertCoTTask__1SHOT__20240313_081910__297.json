All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` checks whether the provided vehicle is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` and returns `true` in that case. Otherwise, it returns `false`. The function is tested with an example for each type.","status":200,"tokens":[226,227],"elapsed":5.649205054,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":363699575,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
