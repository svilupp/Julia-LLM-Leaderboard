All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation using the `isinstance` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    elseif isa(vehicle, Bus) || isa(vehicle, Truck)\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` instances, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` instances. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it will also return `false`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # prints: true\n\nbus = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # prints: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[152,252],"elapsed":6.659515852,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1400114709,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
