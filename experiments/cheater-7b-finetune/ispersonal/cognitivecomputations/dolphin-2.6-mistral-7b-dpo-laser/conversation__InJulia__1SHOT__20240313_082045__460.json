Then, we implement the `ispersonal` function, which checks if the provided argument is of a type (`Car` or `Motorcycle`) that we consider as personal for everyday driving. If it's true, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. Finally, we test the function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[111,326],"elapsed":8.064833829,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1727046309,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
