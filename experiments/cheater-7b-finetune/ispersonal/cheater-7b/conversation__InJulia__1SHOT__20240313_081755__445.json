Then, we define each specific vehicle type (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`) as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. We implement the `ispersonal` function to return true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types and false for `Bus` and `Truck` types. Finally, we provide an example usage of the `ispersonal` function with instances of each vehicle type.","status":200,"tokens":[111,346],"elapsed":8.77495692,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-913226350,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
