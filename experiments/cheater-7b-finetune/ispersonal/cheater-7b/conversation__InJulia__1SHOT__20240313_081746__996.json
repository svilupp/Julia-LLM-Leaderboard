The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function checks if `v` is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. If `v` matches any of these types, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it defaults to `false`. The example demonstrates using this function with instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle` types, as well as `Bus` and `Truck` types to show that they return `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[111,321],"elapsed":8.131596927,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1925224236,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
