All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) = v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n```\n\nThis function checks if the provided vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. The `ispersonal` function uses Julia's built-in `isa` function to determine the type of the vehicle and returns `true` if it is a personal vehicle (`Car` or `Motorcycle`), and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))        # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))        # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))      # Output: false\n```\n\nThe output of the `println` statements should be as indicated.","status":200,"tokens":[111,300],"elapsed":7.608172449,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-319797969,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
