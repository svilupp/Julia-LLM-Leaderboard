It checks whether the next word can be added to the current line without exceeding the `text_width` limit. If it can, the word is added to the current line, otherwise a new line is created. The function continues this process until all the words have been added to the lines. Finally, it joins all the lines together with newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[190,326],"elapsed":8.115678514,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":253053190,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
