It is a test string for the wrap_string function.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a very long line\nthat needs to be wrapped.\nIt is a test string for the\nwrap_string function.\n```\n\nThis function will divide input string into newlines at the appropriate positions determined by the `text_width` parameter.","status":200,"tokens":[109,334],"elapsed":8.713930089,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1264243837,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
