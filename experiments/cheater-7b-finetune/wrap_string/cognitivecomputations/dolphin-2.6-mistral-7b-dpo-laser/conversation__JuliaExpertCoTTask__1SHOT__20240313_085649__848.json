Split the input string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words and keep track of the current line and line length.\n3. If the current line length exceeds the `text_width`, add a new line and start a new line.\n4. Once all words are processed, join the lines and return the wrapped string.\n\nHere is the function `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(s)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = string(word)\n        else\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n**Example**\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n\"This\\nfunction\\nwill\\nwrap\\nwords\\ninto\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[190,296],"elapsed":7.357175942,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1740387812,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
