[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We will iterate over the words in the string and check if the length of the current line, including the space after the word, would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, we will add a new line character before the word. Here are the steps to create the function:\n\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the wrapped string.\n3. Iterate over the words, adding each word to the `result` string. If adding the word would exceed the `text_width`, we will add a new line character before the word.\n4. Return the `result`.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length + 1 > text_width  # Add one for the space after the word\n            result *= \"\\n\"  # Add a newline character\n            current_line_length = 0  # Reset the current line length\n        end\n\n        if current_line_length > 0  # Add a space before the first word of a line\n            result *= \" \"\n        end\n\n        current_line_length += word_length + 1  # Add one for the space after the word\n        result *= word\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example\nprintln(wrap_string(\"Julia is a high-performance, high-level, general-purpose programming language.\"))\n```\n\nThis code should output a string where each line is less than or equal to `text_width` characters.","status":200,"tokens":[376,451],"elapsed":11.612655113,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1209819075,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
