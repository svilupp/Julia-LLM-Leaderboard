It splits the text into words, then iterates over them, adding a new line when the current line exceeds `text_width`. The result is a newline-separated string that respects the given `text_width` constraint.","status":200,"tokens":[109,361],"elapsed":9.631149753,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":328128054,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
