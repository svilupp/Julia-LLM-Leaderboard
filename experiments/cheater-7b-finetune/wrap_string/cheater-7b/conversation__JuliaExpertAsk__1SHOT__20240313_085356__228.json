It then splits the `text` into words, and iterates over those words, checking each time if the current line, along with the word to be added, would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, a new line is started. The function returns the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[109,322],"elapsed":8.175883099,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":32446304,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
