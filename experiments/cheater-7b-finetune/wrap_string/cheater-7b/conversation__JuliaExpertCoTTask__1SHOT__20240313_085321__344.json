If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width, it prints the current line and resets the line with the new word. This way, the function ensures that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`.\n\nFor example, if the string is \"This function will wrap words into lines\", the function will output:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction will\nwrap words\ninto lines\n```\n\nAnd it will return `4` as the number of lines.","status":200,"tokens":[190,343],"elapsed":8.758254793,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":528506988,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
