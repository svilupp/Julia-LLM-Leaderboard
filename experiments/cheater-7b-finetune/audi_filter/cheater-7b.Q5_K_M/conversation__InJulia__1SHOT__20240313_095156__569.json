Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The resulting DataFrame will have the desired filtering and new column added.","status":200,"tokens":[128,208],"elapsed":2.526396731,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":776454764,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
