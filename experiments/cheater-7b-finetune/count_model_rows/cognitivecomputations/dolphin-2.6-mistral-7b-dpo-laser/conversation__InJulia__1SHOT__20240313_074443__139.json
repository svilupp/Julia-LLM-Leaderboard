It uses the `groupby` and `count` functions from the `DataFrames` package.\n\nFirst, you need to install and use the DataFrames package if you have not done it yet:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n```\n\nHere is the function you requested:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    count_per_model = [(model, count(x)) for (model, x) in grouped]\n    return DataFrame(count_per_model, :auto)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first uses the `groupby` function from the `DataFrames` package to group the input `df_cars` by the `model` column. Then it uses a list comprehension to create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a car model and its count in the DataFrame. Finally, it returns a new DataFrame with these counts.","status":200,"tokens":[63,243],"elapsed":6.376396247,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1042897783,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
