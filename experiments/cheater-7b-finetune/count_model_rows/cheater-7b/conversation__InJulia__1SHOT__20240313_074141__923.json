Here is an example implementation of the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    result = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input, groups the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function, and then calculates the number of rows (`nrow`) for each group, renaming the resulting column to `count`. The `combine` function is used to combine the grouped data into a new DataFrame with the calculated counts.","status":200,"tokens":[63,204],"elapsed":5.149417843,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-713852637,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
