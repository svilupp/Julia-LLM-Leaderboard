Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    model_counts = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the dataframe `df_cars` by the column `:model`. Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows (`nrow`) for each group and renames this column as `:count`. The resulting DataFrame `model_counts` contains the count of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[73,169],"elapsed":2.034056219,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1740029530,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
