Then we use `findall` to get all matches of the question and answer sections. We ensure that the number of question and answer sections is the same and then extract the actual questions and answers from the matches. We also include a function `strip` to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Finally, we return the extracted questions and answers as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[106,408],"elapsed":10.102907879,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-975895703,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
