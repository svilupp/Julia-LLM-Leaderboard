When it encounters a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it sets the respective flag to `true`. Then, for each subsequent line, if it's in the Question section and the line doesn't start with a number (indicating continuation), it appends the stripped line to the Question string. Similarly, if it's in the Answer section, it appends the stripped line to the Answer string. Finally, it returns the extracted Question and Answer strings as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[106,274],"elapsed":6.766030986,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-838890921,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
