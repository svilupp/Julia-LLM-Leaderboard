It then extracts the text in the corresponding sections, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and returns the question and answer as a tuple. Note that this assumes that there is exactly one section for each question and answer, and that the first section after the given headers is the one with the actual question or answer. If more complex formatting or additional sections are allowed, the function might need to be updated accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[147,231],"elapsed":5.727526266,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1082321372,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
