[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we will split the markdown text into sections based on the distinct headers for Question and Answer. We'll use a regular expression to match the header format and extract the corresponding text. Then, we'll return a tuple containing the question and the answer.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Test\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract header and following text for Question\n    question_match = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n)\", md)\n    if question_match === nothing\n        throw(\"No 'Question' and 'Answer' found in the provided markdown text.\")\n    end\n\n    question_text = strip(question_match[2])\n    answer_text = strip(question_match[3])\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nDo note that this function assumes the Question and Answer sections don't overlap. If they do, the function's behavior will be undefined.\n\nTo test this implementation, you can use the following code:\n\n```julia\nmd1 = \"# Question\\nHow does Julia compare to Python?\\n\\n# Answer\\nJulia is a high-performance, statically-typed, multi-paradigm programming language that supports metaprogramming and combinatorial computation.\\n\\nJulia's syntax is similar to Python's, making it easy to transition for developers familiar with Python.\\n\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md1)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```\n\nPlease ensure you have the `Base.Test` module available to run this code.\n\nAlso, remember that this function could throw an exception if it does not find the expected sections in the provided markdown text. This is intentionally done to inform the user that the input format is incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[414,448],"elapsed":11.267948838,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":456511761,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
