Here's a simple function in Julia that performs these tasks:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Test\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Remove leading and trailing newlines\n    md = strip(md, trim=true)\n    \n    # Initialize question and answer variables\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Split the md string into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Loop through the lines\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Question\"\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            in_question = true\n            # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n            line = strip(line, trim=true)\n            # Accumulate the question text\n            question = question * \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            in_answer = true\n            # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n            line = strip(line, trim=true)\n            # Accumulate the answer text\n            answer = answer * \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif in_question\n            # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n            line = strip(line, trim=true)\n            # Accumulate the question text\n            question = question * \"\\n\" * line\n        elseif in_answer\n            # Remove leading spaces and newlines\n            line = strip(line, trim=true)\n            # Accumulate the answer text\n            answer = answer * \"\\n\" * line\n        else\n            # Do nothing\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove trailing newlines\n    question = strip(question, trim=true)\n    answer = strip(answer, trim=true)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with a sample markdown text, for example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThis will output: `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[106,538],"elapsed":14.201998005,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1207565493,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
