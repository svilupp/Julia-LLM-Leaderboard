The function takes a string as input, splits it into sections based on the delimiters, and extracts the question and answer text, stripping leading spaces and newlines. The extracted question and answer are then returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[248,353],"elapsed":9.451127013,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2134758609,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
