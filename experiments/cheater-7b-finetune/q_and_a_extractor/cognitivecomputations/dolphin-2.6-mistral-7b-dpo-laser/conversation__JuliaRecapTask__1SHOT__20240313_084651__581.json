[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It initializes two strings `question` and `answer` to store the text under the headers \"Question\" and \"Answer\" respectively. \n\nWe convert the `md` string into a list of lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. Then we iterate over these lines, tracking whether we are reading a question or an answer. When we see `# Question`, we start recording lines until we see `# Answer`. During the recording phase, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the lines.\n\nFinally, we return the `question` and `answer` as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces. This way, any leading newlines will also be stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[412,383],"elapsed":10.156915,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1302713604,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
