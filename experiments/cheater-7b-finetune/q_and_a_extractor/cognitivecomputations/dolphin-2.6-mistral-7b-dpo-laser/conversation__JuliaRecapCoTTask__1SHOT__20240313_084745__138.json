[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The first, `extract_md_sections()`, is a helper function that extracts a single question and answer from a markdown section. The main function, `q_and_a_extractor()`, takes a full markdown text, finds all the sections that start with either \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and processes them with `extract_md_sections()` to extract the question and answer. It returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer. If an answer is not found, an error is raised.\n\nThe provided test cases confirm that the `extract_md_sections()` and `q_and_a_extractor()` functions work correctly. The step-by-step approach allows the solution to be easily understood and debugged.","status":200,"tokens":[414,766],"elapsed":19.24813626,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":917411415,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
