We can also use string manipulation functions to strip leading spaces and newlines. Here's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text:\n\n```julia\nusing Compat\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s*([^\\n]*)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s*([^\\n]*)\"\n    \n    question_match = Compat.Base.match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = Compat.Base.match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    if isnothing(question_match) || isnothing(answer_match)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"The markdown text does not contain both question and answer sections\"))\n    end\n\n    question = strip(question_match[1])\n    answer = strip(answer_match[1])\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to extract the Question and Answer sections from a markdown-formatted text like this:\n\n```julia\njulia> md = \"\"\"\n            # Question\n            What is the capital city of France?\n\n            # Answer\n            Paris is the capital city of France.\n        \"\"\"\n\njulia> question, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\njulia> println(\"Question: $question\")\nQuestion: What is the capital city of France?\n\njulia> println(\"Answer: $answer\")\nAnswer: Paris is the capital city of France.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,422],"elapsed":10.461443027,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1467698788,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
