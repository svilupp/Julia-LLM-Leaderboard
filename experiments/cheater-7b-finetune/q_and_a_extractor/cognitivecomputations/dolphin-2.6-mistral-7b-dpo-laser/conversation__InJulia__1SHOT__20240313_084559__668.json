The `split()` function is used to split the input markdown text into lines based on the newline character. Then the function iterates over the lines and checks if a line starts with \"# Question\". If it does, it strips the leading spaces and the '# Question' part and assigns the remaining text to `question`. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it does the same and then breaks out of the loop.\n\nFor example, you can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n Paris is the capital of France.\n\"\"\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n```shell\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris is the capital of France.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,422],"elapsed":10.452368833,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":500728653,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
