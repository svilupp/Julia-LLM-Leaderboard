It then extracts the text within these sections after stripping leading spaces and newlines. The extracted question and answer are returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[116,223],"elapsed":2.682310512,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1490480480,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
