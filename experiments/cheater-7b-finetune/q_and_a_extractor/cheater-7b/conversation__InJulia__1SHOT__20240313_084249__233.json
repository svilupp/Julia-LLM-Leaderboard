[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    lines = split(md, r\"\\n\")\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(line[length( \"# Question\" ):end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line[length( \"# Answer\" ):end])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text. Note that this function assumes that there is only one `# Question` and `# Answer` section in the given markdown text. If there are multiple sections, this function will only extract the first one. If you need to handle multiple sections, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[106,230],"elapsed":5.819961965,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":628787685,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
