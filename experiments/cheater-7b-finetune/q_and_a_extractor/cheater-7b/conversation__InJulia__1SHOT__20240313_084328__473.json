Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Split the markdown text into lines.\n2. Iterate through the lines to find the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the text following these lines until the next line that doesn't start with `#`. This will be the answer.\n4. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    q, a = \"\", \"\"\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Iterate through the lines\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # Extract question\n        if line == \"# Question\"\n            q = trim(lines[i+1])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Iterate through the lines again to extract the answer\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        # Extract answer\n        if line == \"# Answer\"\n            a = trim(lines[i+1])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    return q, a\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer, where any leading spaces and newlines have been stripped.","status":200,"tokens":[106,347],"elapsed":8.797281346,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-114497773,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
