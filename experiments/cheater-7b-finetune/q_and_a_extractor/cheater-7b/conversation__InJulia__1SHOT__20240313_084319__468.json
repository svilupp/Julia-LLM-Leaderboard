It then extracts the text between these indices, strips leading spaces and newlines, and returns the question and answer as a tuple. If the question or answer section is not found, it returns `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[106,326],"elapsed":8.259464914,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1892468108,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
