Once it identifies a question or answer, it starts accumulating text until it finds the next question or answer section. After extracting the text, it strips any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nTo test the function, you can use something like this:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nParis is the capital of France.\n\"\"\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris is the capital of France.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,482],"elapsed":12.82160825,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1997550057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
