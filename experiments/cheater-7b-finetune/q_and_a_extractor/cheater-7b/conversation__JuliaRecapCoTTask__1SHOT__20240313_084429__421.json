[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Split the text into lines using the `split` function.\n2. Initialize empty strings for the question and answer.\n3. Iterate through the lines, checking for the markdown section headings `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n4. Once a heading is found, start accumulating the text for that section until the next heading is found.\n5. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n6. Return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the Julia function that implements these steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            question = \"\"\n            while !occursin(\"# Answer\", lines[i+1]) && i < length(lines)-1\n                question *= (lines[i+1] * \" \")\n                i += 1\n            end\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            answer = \"\"\n            while !occursin(\"# /Answer\", lines[i+1]) && i < length(lines)-1\n                answer *= (lines[i+1] * \" \")\n                i += 1\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return question.strip(), answer.strip()\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's validate the function by testing it with a sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```\n\nMake sure the function works as expected and adjust the regular expressions if needed to account for variations in the markdown section headings.","status":200,"tokens":[414,504],"elapsed":13.578869065,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":912153448,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
