[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Iterate over each string in the vector and transform it to pig latin.\n3. Use Julia's multithreading capabilities to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\n# Define the function to convert a single string to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = lowercase(first(word))\n    if isalpha(first_letter)\n        return word[2:end-1] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word\n    end\nend\n\n# Define the main function to pig latinify a vector of strings using multithreading\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{AbstractString})\n    # Add the strings to a task queue for parallel processing\n    tasks = [@task pig_latinify($string) for string in strings]\n    \n    # Run each task on a separate thread\n    @async begin\n        for task in tasks\n            @spawn task\n        end\n        \n        # Wait for all tasks to finish\n        for task in tasks\n            fetch(task)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call `pig_latinify` with a vector of strings. The function will return the transformed strings after running each iteration on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[389,351],"elapsed":4.403944792,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1293479015,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
