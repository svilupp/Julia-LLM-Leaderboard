Below is an example of a pig latin transformer `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings using multithreading.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    function pig_latin(word::String)\n        first_letter = string(lowercase(word[1]))\n        if isletter(word[1])\n            if first_letter in \"aeiou\"\n                return \"$word way\"\n            else\n                return \"$word\" * string(lowercase(first_letter), \"ay\")\n            end\n        else\n            return \"$wordway\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    nthreads = Threads.nthreads()\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn(pig_latin) for _ in 1:nthreads]\n    results = [tasks[i]() for i in 1:length(tasks)]\n    Threads.wait(tasks)\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function splits the input strings into tasks, which are then processed in separate threads. The `pig_latin` function is responsible for transforming individual strings into pig latin. It checks whether the first letter is a vowel or a consonant and transforms the string accordingly. The `Threads.@spawn` macro creates a new thread for each iteration, and the results of all threads are collected into the `results` array.","status":200,"tokens":[113,354],"elapsed":9.054908542,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":862633070,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
