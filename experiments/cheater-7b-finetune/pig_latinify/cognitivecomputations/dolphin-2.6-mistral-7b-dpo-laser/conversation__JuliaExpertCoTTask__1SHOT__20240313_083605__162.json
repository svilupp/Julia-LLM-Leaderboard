Define a function `pig_latin_transform` which takes a string and converts it to pig latin:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    word = lowercase(word)\n    if occursin(r\"\\b[aeiouy]\\w+\", word)  # check if the word starts with a vowel\n        return word[2:end] * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        remaining_word = word[2:end]\n        return remaining_word * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n2. Implement `pig_latinify` function which operates on a vector of strings by transforming each string to pig latin using separate threads:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    threads = Vector{Thread}()\n    for word in words\n        thread = Thread(pig_latin_transform, word)\n        push!(threads, thread)\n        @async thread\n    end\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    for thread in threads\n        append!(results, [join(collect(thread))])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n3. Now, use the function with the example vector:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction main()\n    words = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\n    @timeig start = now()\n    transformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\n    @timeig end = now()\n    println(\"Time elapsed: $(end-start)\")\n    println(transformed_words)\nend\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis will create a solution that uses separate threads to transform each string to pig latin and print the transformed words along with the time it took to execute the task.","status":200,"tokens":[201,489],"elapsed":12.227422599,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":253239280,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
