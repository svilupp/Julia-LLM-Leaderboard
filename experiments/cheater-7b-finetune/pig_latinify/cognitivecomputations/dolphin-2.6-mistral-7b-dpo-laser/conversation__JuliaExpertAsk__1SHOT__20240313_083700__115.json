The `transform_strings` function applies the transformation to a vector of strings synchronously. The `parallel_transform_strings` function applies the transformation to a vector of strings asynchronously using separate threads.\n\nPlease note that the `parallel_transform_strings` function will not immediately return the transformed strings. The Julia threading model is cooperative, meaning it relies on the threads to voluntarily yield execution time to other threads. Depending on the nature of the workload, you might need to introduce a `sleep(0.001)` or similar inside the transformation function to yield execution time to other threads.","status":200,"tokens":[113,416],"elapsed":10.409812808,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1955575928,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
