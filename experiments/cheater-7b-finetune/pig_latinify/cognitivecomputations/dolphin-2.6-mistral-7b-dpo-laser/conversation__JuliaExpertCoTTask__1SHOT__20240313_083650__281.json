The `transform_to_pig_latin` function transforms a string to Pig Latin, and it also includes a trivial CPU load simulation using `sleep(0.01*threadid)` in each thread for demonstrating that each transformation runs in a separate thread. The output of the program is the input strings transformed to Pig Latin:\n```\nInput strings: [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\nTransformed strings: [\"ellohay\", \"epplay\", \"ongstra\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[201,521],"elapsed":12.996655175,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-896756965,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
