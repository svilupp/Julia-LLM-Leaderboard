It uses a helper function `pig_latin` to transform an individual string. The `@async` macro is used to run the string transformation on a separate thread for each string. Note that this solution doesn't use multithreading in Julia's built-in threading library (`Threads`), because Julia's built-in threading library does not lend itself well to this kind of task. For this kind of task, it would be much better to use a task-based parallelism library like `Distributed.jl`. However, the task-based parallelism is a more complex topic and is beyond the scope of this solution.","status":200,"tokens":[201,406],"elapsed":10.116478021,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1138434420,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
