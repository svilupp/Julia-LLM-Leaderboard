It then includes the `pig_latinify_helper.jl` file on each worker to define the `pig_latinify` function.\n\nThe main function creates a task for pig latin transformation for each string in the input vector, and executes each task in a separate thread using the `@async` macro. The results are stored in the `result` vector and returned after all tasks have completed.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_helper.jl` file would contain the following:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    first_letter = first(word)\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        first_letter = uppercase(first_letter)\n    end\n    return string(first_letter, \"ay\", substr(word, 2:end))\nend\n```\n\nThis helper function is included on each worker to ensure that the `pig_latinify` function is available for execution.","status":200,"tokens":[113,559],"elapsed":15.060736917,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-872984604,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
