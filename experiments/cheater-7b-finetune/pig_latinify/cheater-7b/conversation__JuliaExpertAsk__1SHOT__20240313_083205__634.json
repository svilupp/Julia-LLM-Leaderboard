If you want to return the transformed strings, you may need to modify the function to work with a mutable data structure, such as `Array{String,1}`, or return a new array of transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[113,343],"elapsed":8.702238249,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-93665009,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
