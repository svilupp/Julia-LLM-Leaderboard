Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. For each string in the input vector, we'll modify it to be in pig latin.\n3. To operate on each string in a separate thread, we'll use Julia's `@threads` macro.\n4. Return the modified vector of strings.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\n# Function to convert a single string to pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify_string(s::String)\n    words = split(s)\n    pig_latin_words = [word[2:end] * word[1:1] * \"ay\" for word in words]\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\n# Define the main function to pig latinify a vector of strings in parallel\n@threads function pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = [pig_latinify_string(s) for s in strings]\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latinified_strings = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(pig_latinified_strings)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify_string` to convert a single string to pig latin. The `pig_latinify` function uses the `@threads` macro to run each transformation in a separate thread. The example usage demonstrates the function being used with a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[201,397],"elapsed":10.143727119,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1782417949,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
