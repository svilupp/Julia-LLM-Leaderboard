The `transform_to_pig_latin` function splits the input string into words, transforms each word to pig latin, and joins the resulting pig latin words back into a string.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_in_parallel` function is an alternative version of `pig_latinify` that uses multiprocessing to run each transformation in a separate thread. It uses the `@spawn` macro to spawn a new thread for each transformation.\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify_in_parallel` function, you should ensure that your Julia environment is set up for multiprocessing. This usually involves setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to the desired number of threads. For example, to set `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to 4, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\n\nAfter setting the environment variable, you can call the `pig_latinify_in_parallel` function with a vector of strings to transform them to pig latin in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[113,639],"elapsed":16.275793086,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":596582657,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
