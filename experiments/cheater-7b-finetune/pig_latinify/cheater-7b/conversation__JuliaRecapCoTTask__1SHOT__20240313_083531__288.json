[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the strings transformed to pig latin.\n2. Use the `Threads` package to create separate threads for each string transformation.\n\nHere is the Julia code that follows these steps:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Define the pig latin transform function\nfunction pig_latinify(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s)\n    latin_words = [word[2:end] * word[1:1] * \"ay\" for word in words]\n    return join(latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\n# Define the pig latin transformer function\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    transformed_strings = [@spawn pig_latinify(s) for s in strings]\n    return transformed_strings\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions:\n\n1. `pig_latinify`: Takes an `AbstractString` and transforms it to pig latin.\n2. `pig_latinify`: Takes a vector of strings (`Vector{<:AbstractString}`) and applies the pig latin transformation to each string in a separate thread using the `@spawn` macro.\n\nThe `Threads` package is used to create separate threads for each string transformation. The transformed strings are then returned as a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[380,353],"elapsed":9.101121331,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1163799692,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
