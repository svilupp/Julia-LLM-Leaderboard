The `@distributed` macro is used to parallelize the loop over the strings. The `transform_to_pig_latin` function is responsible for converting each word to pig latin. The `add_ay` function is a helper function that adds \"ay\" to the end of a word. The `@info` macro is used to display the transformed string.","status":200,"tokens":[113,323],"elapsed":8.186334554,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1346880585,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
