The `pig_latin` function takes a string and converts it to pig latin by appending \"ay\" to the end of each word after moving the first letter to the end. Note that you need to use the `Distributed` module and run the code in a Julia environment with multiple cores or processes to see the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[113,354],"elapsed":8.969520246,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":613123300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
