It uses Julia's multithreading capabilities to handle the conversion of each string in a separate thread. The `to_pig_latin` function is used to convert a single word to pig latin, and the `pig_latinify_async` function is used to perform the conversion in a separate thread. The `@async` macro is used to start a new task for each string, and the `wait` function is used to ensure that all tasks are completed before returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[201,505],"elapsed":12.911248699,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-586896080,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
