Note that this example assumes you're using Julia version 1.3 or later, as threading was introduced in that release.\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\naddprocs(2) # Add 2 worker processes\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    @distributed for string in strings\n        latin_string = pig_latin(string)\n        println(latin_string)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(s::AbstractString)\n    words = split(s)\n    latin_words = [pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    return join(latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n    if islowercase(first_letter)\n        return word[2:end-1] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this is a test\"]\npig_latinify(strings)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We first import the `Distributed` module, which allows us to use parallelism in Julia.\n- We add two worker processes to the Distributed array using `addprocs(2)`.\n- The `pig_latinify` function uses the `@distributed` macro to run each string transformation on a separate thread. This is done by iterating over the input strings, converting each string to pig latin using the `pig_latin` function, and printing the result.\n- The `pig_latin` function takes an individual string, splits it into words, and applies the pig latin transformation to each word. It then joins the transformed words back together into a single string.\n- The `pig_latin` function for individual words checks if the first letter is lowercase or uppercase and applies the appropriate transformation.\n- Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the `pig_latinify` function with an example vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[72,514],"elapsed":13.718512934,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1628123509,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
