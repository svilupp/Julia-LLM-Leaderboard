Here's a function named `keep_only_names` that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isa(word, AbstractString) && startswith(word, string(Char('A')):string(Char('Z'))) && !startswith(word, string(Char('A')))[1:1]]\nend\n```\n\nThe function iterates over each `word` in the provided `words` list and checks if it's a string (`AbstractString`), starts with a capital letter (`startswith(word, string(Char('A')):string(Char('Z')))`), and it does not start with an ASCII capital letter (`!startswith(word, string(Char('A')))[1:1]`). If all conditions are met, it includes the word in the returned list.","status":200,"tokens":[115,232],"elapsed":5.733765935,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1291198780,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
