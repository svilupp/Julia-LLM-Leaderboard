The `uppercase('A':'Z')` generates a range of all uppercase letters from A to Z and the `firstchar(word) ∈ uppercase('A':'Z')` checks if the first character of a word is in this range. If it is, the word is added to the new vector. At the end, we have a new vector with only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[74,186],"elapsed":4.582557267,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1097708618,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
