It uses the `isfirstlettercapital(word)` function to check if the first letter of the word is a capital letter. If it is, the word is added to the `filtered_words` list. Finally, the function returns the list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[205,190],"elapsed":4.738101633,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-394410585,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
