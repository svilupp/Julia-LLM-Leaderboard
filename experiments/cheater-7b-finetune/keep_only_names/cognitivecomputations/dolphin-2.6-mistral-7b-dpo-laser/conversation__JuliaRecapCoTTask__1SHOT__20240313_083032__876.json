[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, you are asked to create a function that iterates over a list of words and removes words that do not start with a capital letter. There are no special instructions provided, so we will proceed with the default Julia programming guidelines and solve the task.\n\n## Code\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isa(word, AbstractString) && first(word) in ['A'-'Z', 'A'-'Z'.'

It iterates over each word in the input vector, and for each word, it checks if the first character is a capital letter using the `first(word) in ['A'-'Z', 'A'-'Z'.' ']` expression. If so, it appends the word to the `filtered_words` vector. Finally, it returns the `filtered_words` vector after iterating over all the words in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[382,293],"elapsed":7.379065618,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1205305954,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
