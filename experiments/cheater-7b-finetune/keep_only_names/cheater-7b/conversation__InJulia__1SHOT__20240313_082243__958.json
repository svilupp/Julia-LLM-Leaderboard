The `filter` function iterates over each word in the list, and the condition `occursin(r\"^[A-Z]\", word)` checks if the word starts with a capital letter using a regular expression. The `^` symbol in the regular expression denotes the start of the string, and `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[74,194],"elapsed":4.893515393,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1997397072,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
