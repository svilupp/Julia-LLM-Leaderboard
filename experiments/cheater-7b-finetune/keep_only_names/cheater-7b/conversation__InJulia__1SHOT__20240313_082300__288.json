Here's a Julia function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Test the function\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to go through each word in the `words` list and only keep those that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase, and `first(word)` gets the first character of the word.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided test case, which should output: `[\"Dog\", \"Apple\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[74,199],"elapsed":5.104652204,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":543971734,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
