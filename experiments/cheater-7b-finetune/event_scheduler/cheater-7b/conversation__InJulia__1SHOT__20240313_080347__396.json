If it is, we return \"No events\". Otherwise, we sort the events by their start time. Then, we iterate through the sorted events and check if the start time of each event is earlier than the end time of the previous event. If so, we return \"Conflict\" as there is an overlap. If we reach the end of the iteration without finding any overlaps, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[127,381],"elapsed":9.678941736,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1609772683,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
