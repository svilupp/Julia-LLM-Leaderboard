Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then, it parses each event using the `DateTime` type, which is part of the `Dates` module. The events are then sorted by their start time using the `sort!` function with a custom comparator to ensure correct sorting. Finally, the function iterates through the sorted events and checks if the finish time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event. If it is, a conflict is detected and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[433,511],"elapsed":13.229841321,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":436935428,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
