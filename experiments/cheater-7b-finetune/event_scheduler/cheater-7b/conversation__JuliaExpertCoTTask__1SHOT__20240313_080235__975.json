Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Parse the start and finish times using the Dates package.\n   - Sort the events based on their start times.\n   - Check for any overlaps by comparing the finish time of one event with the start time of the next event.\n2.

Since the task doesn't specify a specific timezone, we'll assume the default timezone for the current day.\n\n### Parsing date strings\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_datetime(datetime_str)\n    return DateTime(datetime_str, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse and sort events based on start time\n    parsed_events = [(parse_datetime(event[1]), parse_datetime(event[2])) for event in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n### Testing the function\n\nAssuming that there are no conflicts in the provided data, we should get the output \"No conflicts\".\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis code should now be ready to solve the task.","status":200,"tokens":[315,641],"elapsed":16.490994682,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-179017930,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
