Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[168,312],"elapsed":8.508954724,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1609585781,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
