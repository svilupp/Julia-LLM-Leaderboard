Then it iterates through each event, checking if the finish time of the current event is greater than the start time of the next event (meaning they overlap) and if that's the case, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlapping events after iterating through all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-10 10:00\", \"2022-01-10 12:00\"), (\"2022-01-10 13:00\", \"2022-01-10 15:00\"), (\"2022-01-11 09:00\", \"2022-01-11 11:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Outputs \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[127,389],"elapsed":10.512568777,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-547821119,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
