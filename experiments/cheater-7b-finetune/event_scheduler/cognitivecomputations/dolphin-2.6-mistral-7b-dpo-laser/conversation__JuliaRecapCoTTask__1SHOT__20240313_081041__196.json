[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then iterates through all the events, checking if any successive events overlap (i.e., if the finish time of the previous event is later than the start time of the next). If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it processes all the events without finding an overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input is a list of tuples where the first element is the start time and the second element is the finish time, and that the times are already in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If this is not the case, the input should be preprocessed accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[435,330],"elapsed":9.148531693,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-625114818,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
