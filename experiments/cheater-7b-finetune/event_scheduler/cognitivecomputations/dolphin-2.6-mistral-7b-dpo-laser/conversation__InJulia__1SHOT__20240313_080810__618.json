It iterates through each pair of events and checks if they overlap.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # If the input list is empty, return \"No events\"\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        # If the first event overlaps with the next, return \"Conflict\"\n        if events[i][2] > events[i+1][1] && events[i][1] < events[i+1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        elseif events[i+1][2] > events[i][1] && events[i+1][1] < events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If there's no overlapping event, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can pass a list of tuples where the first element of the tuple is the start time and the second is the finish time of the event.\n\nExample:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 12:00\"), (\"2022-01-01 13:00\", \"2022-01-01 14:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: \"Conflict\"\n```\nThe example will return \"Conflict\" because the second event starts after the first event and ends before the first event, which means they overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[127,419],"elapsed":10.591708145,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":821015032,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
