The problem is about scheduling events such that there are no overlapping time intervals.\n\nThe Dates package will be used to parse the input strings into DateTime objects.\n\nHere is the code which implements the described problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    start_times = [event[1] for event in events]\n    finish_times = [event[2] for event in events]\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        if any(start_times[i] < event[1] .<= finish_times[i] && \n                event[2] < finish_times[i] .<= event[1] for event in events[i+1:end])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Testing\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThe function `event_scheduler` takes a list of events. It first checks if the input list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it extracts the start and finish times of the events into separate arrays.\n\nThe function then goes through all events and at each iteration, it checks if there is any overlap with the events that come later in the list. If any overlap is detected, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is detected, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[315,436],"elapsed":10.950007226,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":354573777,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
