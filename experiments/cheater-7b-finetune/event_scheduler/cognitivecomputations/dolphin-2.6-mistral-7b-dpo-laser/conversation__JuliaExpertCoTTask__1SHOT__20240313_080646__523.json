Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    function check_overlap(start_time, end_time)\n        return any(start_time <= e[1] && e[2] <= end_time for e in events)\n    end\n\n    conflicts = any(check_overlap(events[i][1], events[i][2]) for i in 1:length(events))\n\n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis program solves the task by first checking if the input list is empty, if it is, it returns \"No events\". Then, it defines a helper function `check_overlap` that checks if an event overlaps with any other event in the list. Finally, it finds if there are any overlapping events and returns \"Conflict\" if any, otherwise \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[315,317],"elapsed":7.953477067,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":468849323,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
