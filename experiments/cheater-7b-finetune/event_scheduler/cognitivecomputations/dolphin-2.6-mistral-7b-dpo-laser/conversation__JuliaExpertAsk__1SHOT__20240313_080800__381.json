It first checks if the list is empty, if so, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it iterates over each event comparing their start and finish times with the next events. If it finds any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[168,329],"elapsed":8.182609829,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1300252970,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
