This function uses the Dates module which provides a collection of functions for working with dates and times.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ErrorException(\"Input must be of type DateTime. Provided type was $(typeof(dt)).\"))\n    else\n        return DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour + bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a DateTime object and an optional second argument (the number of hours to bump the timezone) like so:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 10, 15)  # Example DateTime object\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2)  # This will bump the timezone by 2 hours\n```\n\nIf you try to call the function with a Date object, an error will be thrown:\n\n```julia\ndate = Date(2022, 1, 10)  # Example Date object\n# This will throw an error:\n# Input must be of type DateTime. Provided type was Date.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,307],"elapsed":8.284029063,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1834363526,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
