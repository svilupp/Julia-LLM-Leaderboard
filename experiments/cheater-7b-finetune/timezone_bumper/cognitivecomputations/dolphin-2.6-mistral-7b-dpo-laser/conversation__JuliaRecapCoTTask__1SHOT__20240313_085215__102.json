[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the Task, we first need to ensure that the input is of type DateTime. If it's not, we should throw an error. In Julia, type constraints can be done using the `is` function.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    @assert isa(dt, DateTime) \"Input must be of type DateTime. Provided: $dt\"\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will increase the provided DateTime timestamp by the number of hours specified (default value is 3 hours). The `@assert` macro is used to check if the input is of type DateTime. If it's not, it throws an error with a suitable error message.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 10), 2)\n2022-01-01T12:00:00.000 UTC\n```\n\nThe above code will increase the provided DateTime timestamp (2022-01-01 10:00:00) by 2 hours.\n\nNote: The `Dates.Hour(bump)` is used to add the specified number of hours in the timezone_bumper function.","status":200,"tokens":[385,332],"elapsed":8.378494066,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":198622468,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
