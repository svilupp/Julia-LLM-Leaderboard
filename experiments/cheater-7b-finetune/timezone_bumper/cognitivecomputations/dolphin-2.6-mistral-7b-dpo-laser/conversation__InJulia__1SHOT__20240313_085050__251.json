Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can accomplish this by using Julia's built-in DateTime and Date types from the Dates module and also by defining a custom error type. Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n@custom_errorstruct TimezoneBumpError(msg)\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if input is a DateTime type\n    if !(typeof(dt) <: DateTime)\n        throw(TimezoneBumpError(\"Input should be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Increase timestamp by bump hours\n    dt_bumped = dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    \n    return dt_bumped\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 8, 20, 8, 30, 0) # August 20, 2022 at 8:30 AM\n\n# Increase timestamp by default of 3 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # 2022-08-20T11:30:00\n\n# Increase timestamp by a custom amount of 6 hours\nbumped_dt_custom = timezone_bumper(dt, 6)\nprintln(bumped_dt_custom) # 2022-08-20T14:30:00\n\n# Attempting to bump a Date type will throw an error\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2022, 8, 20))\ncatch(e)\n    if isa(e, TimezoneBumpError)\n        println(\"Caught error: \", e.msg)\n    else\n        rethrow(e)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code will first check if the input is a DateTime type. If it's not, it throws an error. If it is, it increments the timestamp by the given hours (or default of 3 hours). It also handles custom error types for the date check error.","status":200,"tokens":[77,501],"elapsed":12.428264477,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1867936872,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
