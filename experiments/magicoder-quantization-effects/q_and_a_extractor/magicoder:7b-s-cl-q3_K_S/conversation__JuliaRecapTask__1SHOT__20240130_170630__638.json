[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    q_found = false\n    a_found = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n') \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            q_found = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            a_found = true\n        elseif q_found\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif a_found\n            answer *= strip(line) \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThe function splits the markdown-formatted text `md` by each line and checks whether it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it toggles the corresponding boolean flag. Otherwise, if both flags are true, it appends the stripped content of the line to the question or answer variable, respectively. The final result is a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that each `# Question` section has exactly one `# Answer` section and vice versa. If there might be discrepancies in the input, you would need to add additional checks or error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.366313437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
