[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `q_and_a_extractor` written in Julia to solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    reading = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")  # start of a new question section\n            reading = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")   # start of a new answer section\n            reading = false\n        elseif reading\n            question *= strip(line)\n        else\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text into lines and then iterating over these lines. If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets a flag indicating that we should start reading the question section. Similarly, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets a flag to indicate that we should stop reading from the question section.\n\nIf we are currently in the question section (i.e., `reading == true`), we append the stripped version of this line to our current question text. If we are not, then we append the stripped version of this line to our current answer text. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.875794262,"_type":"aimessage"}]
