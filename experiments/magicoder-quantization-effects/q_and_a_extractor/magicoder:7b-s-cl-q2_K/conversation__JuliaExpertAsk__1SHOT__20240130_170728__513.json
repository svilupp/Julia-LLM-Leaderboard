If a line is a section start (Question or Answer), it sets `current_section` to either \"question\" or \"answer\". Otherwise, if `current_section` is set, it appends the stripped line to that section's accumulator (`question` or `answer`).\n\nFinally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[128,258],"elapsed":1.988936968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
