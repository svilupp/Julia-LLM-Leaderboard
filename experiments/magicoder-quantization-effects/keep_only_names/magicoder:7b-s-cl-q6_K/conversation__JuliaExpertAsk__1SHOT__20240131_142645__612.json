The result is a new collection containing only those elements for which the predicate was true. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis will return `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":1.60310963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
