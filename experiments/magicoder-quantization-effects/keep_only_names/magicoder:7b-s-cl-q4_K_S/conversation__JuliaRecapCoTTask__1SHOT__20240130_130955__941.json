[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Below is the function written in Julia language. The special instructions are incorporated into the function as comments for the understanding of readers.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Define an empty list to store valid names\n    valid_names = []\n  \n    # Iterate over words, check if it starts with a capital letter and add it to valid_names\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase using `isupper` function.\n        if isupper(word[1])\n            push!(valid_names, word)  # Add to list\n        end\n    end\n\n    return valid_names  # Return the final list of names\nend\n```\nRemember that in Julia indexing starts from `1`, not `0` like Python. Also, you should note that this function will keep words with a capital letter regardless of their case (it will treat 'Dog' and 'dog' as two different words), if you want it to consider cases also then you have to add logic for the same.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.884835338,"_type":"aimessage"}]
