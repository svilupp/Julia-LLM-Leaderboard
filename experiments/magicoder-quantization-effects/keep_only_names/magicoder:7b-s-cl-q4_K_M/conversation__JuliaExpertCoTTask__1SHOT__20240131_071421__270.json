The `isupper` function checks whether the first character of a string (the first argument passed to `isupper`) is uppercase. If it is, that word is included in the new list. If not, it's excluded.\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":1.375313218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
