[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of your task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all julia code blocks using regex\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, seed=1) |> collect\n    \n    # Join the code blocks and remove leading/trailing whitespace and newline characters\n    joined_code = join([replace(m.captures[1], r\"^[\\s\\n]*|[\\s\\n]*$\" => \"\") for m in code_blocks]..., \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Return the concatenated, un-indented julia code as a string\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in your markdown document. It then extracts and joins together all these blocks into a single string, removing any leading or trailing whitespace or newline characters that may have appeared due to the original formatting.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `md` is the complete markdown document where the Julia code blocks could be found. If there are multiple such documents and you want to extract from each of them separately, you would need to call `extract_julia_code` on each document separately.","status":200,"tokens":[0,291],"elapsed":2.846402257,"_type":"aimessage"}]
