[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

It then removes the code fences and joins the code blocks together with a newline. The resulting string is returned by the function. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each code block starts and ends with a newline character (`\\n`). If there are multiple code blocks in the same markdown block, they will be joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.532889037,"_type":"aimessage"}]
