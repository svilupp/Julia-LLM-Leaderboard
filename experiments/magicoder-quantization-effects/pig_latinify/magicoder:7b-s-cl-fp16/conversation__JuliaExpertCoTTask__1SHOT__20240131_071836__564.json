Inside this block, we loop over each word in the input array and spawn a new task on worker 2 using `@spawnat 2 pig_latin_word(word)`.\n\nThe `pig_latin_word` function takes a word as an argument and returns its Pig Latin translation. It does this by taking the first letter of the word, then appending it to the end of the rest of the word with \"ay\" added in between.\n\nWhen you run `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will return:\n```julia\np\"ellohay\"\np\"appleway\"\np\"strongway\"\np\"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":5.756085465,"_type":"aimessage"}]
