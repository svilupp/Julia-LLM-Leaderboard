[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Transducers, Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    t = map(x -> \"$(split(x)[1])ay $(join(split(x)[2:end]))\", words);\n    transduce(t, x -> Threads.Threads.spawn(println, x), collect(t))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings `words` as an input and returns the same vector transformed into Pig Latin. It uses the Transducers package to apply transformations on each element in the collection (vector in this case). The `map` transducer applies a function to each item in the collection, here it's used to rearrange words in Pig Latin format.\n\nThen we use the `transduce` function from the Transducers package which applies a sequence of transformations on an input and returns the result. Here we use the `collect` function as the reducing step that collects each result into a vector. \n\nFinally, we call `Threads.spawn(println, x)` for each element in the result to print it, this is done using threading to run on separate threads.\n\nPlease note that Transducers and Threads packages are relatively new addition to Julia language and might not be available in all environments or older versions of Julia. You can add them via Pkg.add(\"Transducers\") and Pkg.add(\"Threads\").","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":3.202153244,"_type":"aimessage"}]
