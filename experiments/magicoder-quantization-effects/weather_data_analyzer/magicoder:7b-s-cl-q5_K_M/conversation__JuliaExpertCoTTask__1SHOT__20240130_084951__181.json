Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if diff([min_temp, max_temp]) > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff([min_temp, max_temp]) < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nThis function checks if the input array `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.

The function finally constructs and returns the named tuple containing these computed statistics.","status":200,"tokens":[0,311],"elapsed":2.776715971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
