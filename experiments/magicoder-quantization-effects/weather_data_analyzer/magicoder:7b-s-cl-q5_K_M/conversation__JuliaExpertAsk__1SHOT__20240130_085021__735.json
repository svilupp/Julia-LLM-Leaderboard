Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Importing the Statistics package \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else \n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg > max_temp \n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend \n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all fields. Otherwise, it calculates the average (`avg`), maximum (`max_temp`), and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the list using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively. Then, it checks if the average is greater than or less than both of these extremes to determine the trend. Finally, it returns a named tuple with all computed values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.786522199,"_type":"aimessage"}]
