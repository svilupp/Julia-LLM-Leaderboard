It checks that the input is indeed a `DateTime`. If it's not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases the DateTime by the specified number of hours (defaulting to 3 if no bump value is provided).\n\nYou can test this function with your example like so:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThis will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00`, which is the original time plus three hours.","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":2.207418059,"_type":"aimessage"}]
