Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    \n    # Create new column\n    DataFrames.transform!(df, :manufacturer => (x -> x .== \"a4\") .=> :audi_a4_type)\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function from the `DataFrames` package to filter rows in the DataFrame based on two conditions: manufacturer should be equal to \"audi\" and model should be either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` where every row equals true if the model is \"a4\", otherwise false. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame after performing all these operations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":2.146286929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
