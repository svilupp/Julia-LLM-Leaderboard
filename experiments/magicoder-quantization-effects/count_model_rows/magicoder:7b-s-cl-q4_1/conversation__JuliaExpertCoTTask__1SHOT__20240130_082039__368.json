Here is an implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\nNow let's test this function with the provided DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n`counts` now holds the number of rows for each model. For example, counts[1] will give you the number of times 'a4' appears in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.567949484,"_type":"aimessage"}]
