Then it uses the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each model using the `nrow => first` operation, which means \"for each unique value in this column, count how many times it appears\". The result is a new DataFrame with one row per unique model and the corresponding count of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,170],"elapsed":1.619203543,"_type":"aimessage"}]
