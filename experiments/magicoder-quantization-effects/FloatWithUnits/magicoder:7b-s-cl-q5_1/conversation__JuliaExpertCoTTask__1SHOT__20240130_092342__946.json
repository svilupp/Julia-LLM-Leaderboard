The `show` function takes an IO stream (`io::IO`) and the instance `f` of type `FloatWithUnits`. It then prints to this stream both the value and the unit of the float with units object.\n\nYou can test this by creating a `FloatWithUnits` object using your example data:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.996225217,"_type":"aimessage"}]
