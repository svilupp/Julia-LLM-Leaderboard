We then define a function called `show` that will be used to display the object in IJulia notebook or any other Julia based interface. \n\nThe `Base.show` method takes two arguments, `io::IO` (which is where your output will go), and `u::FloatWithUnits`. We then use a string interpolation `$(u.value) $(u.unit)` to print the value and unit of the object in the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":1.734739432,"_type":"aimessage"}]
