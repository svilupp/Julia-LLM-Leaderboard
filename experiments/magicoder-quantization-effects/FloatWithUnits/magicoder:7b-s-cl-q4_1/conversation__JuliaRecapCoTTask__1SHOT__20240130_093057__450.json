[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can define such struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T<:Number}\n    value::T\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThe `Base.show` method defines how a FloatWithUnits object will be printed. The function takes an IO stream and the FloatWithUnits object as arguments, then it prints out the value and unit of the FloatWithUnits object separated by a space.\n\nIn case you need to handle multiple types for `value` field (not just Number), then you could define your own type-specific show methods using `@eval`. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nfor T in [Float64, Int64] # add all the types you want to support\n    @eval begin\n        function Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits{$T})\n            print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n        end\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.206920329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
