If adding a new word would exceed `text_width`, it adds a newline character to the result. Then it appends the current word and a space to the result. The function finally returns the result.\n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis function \nwill wrap \nwords into \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.786135198,"_type":"aimessage"}]
