Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". It then iterates over all pairs of events in the list and checks for any overlap between them by comparing the start times and end times of each pair of events. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,341],"elapsed":2.972427053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
