X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it's not, it sorts the array of tuples by the start time of each event. Then it iterates over the sorted array and for each pair of consecutive events, it compares their start times to see if one starts before the other ends. If a conflict is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can use this function with an array of tuples like so:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-09-01 10:00\", \"2021-09-01 11:00\"), (\"2021-09-01 12:00\", \"2021-09-01 13:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,402],"elapsed":3.478039828,"_type":"aimessage"}]
