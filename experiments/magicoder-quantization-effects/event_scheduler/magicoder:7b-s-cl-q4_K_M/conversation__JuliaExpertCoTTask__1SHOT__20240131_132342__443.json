It uses the Dates package to parse dates and compare them for conflicts.\n\nFirst, you need to install the Dates package using Pkg.add(\"Dates\").\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start_i = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        finish_i = DateTime(events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j = DateTime(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = DateTime(events[j][2])\n            \n            if (start_i <= start_j < finish_i) || (start_j <= start_i < finish_j)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each event in the list and checking if it overlaps with any other events. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping events are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.446142458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
