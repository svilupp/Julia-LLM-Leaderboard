Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events based on their start times. Then, for each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the previous event ends after the current event starts. If so, there's a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":4.55956618,"_type":"aimessage"}]
