The `map` function applies this operation to every value in the `dt` column, converting the DateTimes into integers representing the year and month respectively.\n\nHere's how you can use this function on your DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will create a new DataFrame with the `ym` column added.
