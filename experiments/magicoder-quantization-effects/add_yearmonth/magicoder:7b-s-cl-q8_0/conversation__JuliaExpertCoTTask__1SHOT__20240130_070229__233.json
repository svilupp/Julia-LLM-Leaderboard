This function extracts the year and month from the DateTime object and concatenates them together into an integer. The result is then stored in a new column `ym`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your DataFrame only contains DateTime objects, as it uses the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions which are specific to these types. If your DataFrame can contain other kinds of objects, you might need to add error handling or convert the objects to DateTimes first.","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":3.283662145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
