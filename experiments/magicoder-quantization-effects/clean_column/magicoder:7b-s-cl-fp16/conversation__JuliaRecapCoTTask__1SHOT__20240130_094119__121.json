[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore and strip any leading/trailing whitespaces.\n    col = replace(replace(col, \" \" => \"_\"), \"-\" => \"_\") |> String |> rstrip |> lstrip\n\n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a string `col` representing the column name, converts it to lowercase using `lowercase`, replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores using `replace` and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using `|> String |> rstrip |> lstrip`. \n\nThis function does not return anything as the cleaned column is directly stored in `col`. The `|>` operator is a kind of infix version of `pipeline` from R which is useful for chaining functions. \n\nNote: This solution assumes that you're using a string type that supports Unicode (such as UTF-8 strings, `String`). If your data might include special characters or non-ASCII alphabets, it's better to use the more specific string type (e.g., `UTF16String` or `UTF8String`).","status":200,"tokens":[11,294],"elapsed":5.229445012,"_type":"aimessage"}]
