The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it defaults to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,244],"elapsed":9.068966417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
