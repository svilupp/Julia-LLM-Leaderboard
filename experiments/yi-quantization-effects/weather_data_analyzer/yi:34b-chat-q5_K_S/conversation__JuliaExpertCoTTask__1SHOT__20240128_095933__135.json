Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{T}) where T <: Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine trend using a simple approach: check if the first half is higher than the second half\n    half_length = length(temps) ÷ 2\n    first_half = temps[1:(half_length + 1)]  # include the middle element to avoid rounding errors\n    second_half = temps[(half_length+1):end]\n    if sum(first_half) > sum(second_half)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif sum(first_half) < sum(second_half)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Output will be a named tuple with the calculated statistics and trend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[290,313],"elapsed":17.061361437,"_type":"aimessage"}]
