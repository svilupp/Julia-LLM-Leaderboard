Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T<:Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate statistics\n    mean_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Check temperature trend\n    is_increasing = all(x -> x >= temps[1], temps)\n    is_decreasing = all(x -> x <= temps[end], temps[reverse.(1:length(temps))])\n    trend = is_increasing ? :increasing : (is_decreasing ? :decreasing : :stable)\n\n    # Return results as a named tuple\n    return (average = mean_temp, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])  # Output will be printed by the REPL\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a conceptual solution. When running it in the Julia REPL, you would need to execute the `weather_data_analyzer` function with your actual temperature data after defining it. The output would be the named tuple of statistical results as described in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":8.845088322,"_type":"aimessage"}]
