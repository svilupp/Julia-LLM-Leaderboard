[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

It then iterates over each word and appends it to the current line. If the length of the current line plus the length of the word exceeds the `text_width`, the line is wrapped, and the next word starts on a new line.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"Hello there! How are you today? This is a test string to see if it works as expected.\")\n\"Hello\\nthere! How\\nare you\\ntoday? This\\nis a test\\nstring to see\\nif it works as expected.\"\n```\n\nThe function works with the default `text_width` of 10 characters per line, and wraps the text accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":24.712421001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
