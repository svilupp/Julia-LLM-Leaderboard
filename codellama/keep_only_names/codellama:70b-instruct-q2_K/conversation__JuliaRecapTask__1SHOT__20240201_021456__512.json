[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. `keep_only_names`: Function to iterate over the provided list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nJulia Language Syntax: \n```julia-repl\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize a new array for capitalized words\n    capitalized_words = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\nIn this function: \n- We iterate through each `word` of the `words` list and check if the first letter is equal to its uppercase equivalent. If it is, we add it to the `capitalized_words` array. \n- The `uppercase()` function converts a string to all uppercase letters. For example, `uppercase(\"dog\")` will return \"DOG\". \n\nIn summary, this function iterates over each word in the list and returns only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[376,246],"elapsed":10.573169896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
