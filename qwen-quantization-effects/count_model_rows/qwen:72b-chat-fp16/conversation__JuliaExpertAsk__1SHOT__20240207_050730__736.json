The resulting GroupedDataFrame object is then passed to the `count` function, which calculates the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `_count`, where `_count` represents the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,106],"elapsed":104.381950232,"_type":"aimessage"}]
