The resulting grouped object is then passed to the `count` function, which counts the number of rows in each group.\n\nFor example, if `df_cars` is a DataFrame with columns `model`, `color`, and `price`, and looks like this:\n\n```\nmodel   color  price\nToyota  blue    20000\nHonda   red     25000\nToyota  green   18000\nFord    yellow  30000\nHonda   black   27000\n```\n\nthen calling `count_model_rows(df_cars)` will return a new DataFrame that looks like this:\n\n```\nmodel   _rowcount\nToyota  2\nHonda   2\nFord    1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":241.097652049,"_type":"aimessage"}]
