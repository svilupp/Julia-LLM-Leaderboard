It then applies a transformation to each group that extracts the model name and calculates the length of each group (i.e., the number of rows with that model). The resulting data is then sorted in ascending order by model name.\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Honda Civic\", \"Toyota Camry\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Ford Mustang\"], year=[2018, 2019, 2020, 2021])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will output the following table:\n```yaml\nmodel | count\n------|------\nCivic |     2\nCamry |     1\nMustang    |     1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,264],"elapsed":257.940078196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
