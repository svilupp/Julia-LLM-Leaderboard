Then it uses the pipe operator (`|>`) to pass the result to a lambda function that creates a new DataFrame with two columns: `model`, which contains the unique values of the `model` column in the input DataFrame, and `nrow`, which contains the number of rows for each group.\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input DataFrame has a `model` column. If the name of the column is different, you can replace `:model` with the appropriate column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":216.390921614,"_type":"aimessage"}]
