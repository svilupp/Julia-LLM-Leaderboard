Then it pipes the resulting grouped data to the `length` function, which returns the number of rows in each group.\n\nFor example, if you have a DataFrame `df_cars` with the following data:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\"],\n                    year=[2018, 2019, 2020, 2019],\n                    color=[\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\", \"black\"])\n```\n\nYou can call `count_model_rows` on this DataFrame to get a count of the number of rows for each model:\n\n```julia\njulia> count_model_rows(df_cars)\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 1\n 1\n```\n\nThis indicates that there are two rows with the \"Toyota\" model, one row with the \"Honda\" model, and one row with the \"Ford\" model.","status":200,"tokens":[81,277],"elapsed":288.845571329,"_type":"aimessage"}]
