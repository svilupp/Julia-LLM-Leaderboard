The resulting object is then piped (`|>`) into the `length` function which calculates the number of rows in each group. This returns a new DataFrame with two columns, `model` and `n`, where `n` is the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,114],"elapsed":112.869548547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
