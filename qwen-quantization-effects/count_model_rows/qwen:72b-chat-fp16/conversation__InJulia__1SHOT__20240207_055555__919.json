Then it uses the `combine` function to apply the `nrow` function to each group, which counts the number of rows in each group. The resulting DataFrame contains two columns: one for the model name and one for the corresponding row count.\nYou can call this function with your dataframe as an argument:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\"], year=[2021, 2020, 2022, 2021])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis would return a new dataframe with the counts of each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":240.128367878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
