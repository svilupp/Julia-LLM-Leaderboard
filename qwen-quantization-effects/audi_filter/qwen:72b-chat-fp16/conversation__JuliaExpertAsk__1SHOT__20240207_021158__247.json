Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

I'll provide an explanation below the code.\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df_audi = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    df_audi[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_audi\nend\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input.\n2. We use the `filter()` function to filter rows based on the condition that the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". This filtered DataFrame is stored in `df_audi`.\n3. To create the new column `audi_a4_","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":191.486612818,"_type":"aimessage"}]
