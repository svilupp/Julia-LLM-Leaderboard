Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:stable)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max = maximum(temps)\n        min = minimum(temps)\n        \n        diff = abs.(diff(sort(temps)))\n        if all(diff .<= 1)\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif all(diff .>= 1)\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    \n        return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` takes in a list of temperatures and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature and a trend.

If the length is 0, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\nOtherwise, the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures are calculated using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\nNext, the differences between consecutive elements of the sorted input list are calculated using the `diff` function. These differences are then checked to determine the trend.\nIf all the differences are less than or equal to 1, the trend is considered stable. If all the differences are greater than or equal to 1, the trend is considered increasing. Otherwise, the trend is considered decreasing.\nFinally, a named tuple with the calculated values is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":279.517684155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
