The resulting integers are then concatenated together into a string of format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function.\nTo pad the month component with leading zeros, we use the `lpad` function from Julia's `Base` module.\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `dt` column in the input DataFrame is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, you may need to convert it first using the `Date` or `DateTime` constructors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":197.58905863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
