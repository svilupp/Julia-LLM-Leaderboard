The `year` and `month` functions are applied to the `dt` column using the dot syntax, and the resulting vectors of integers are converted to strings using the `string` function. The `lpad` function is used to left-pad the month numbers with a leading zero if necessary. Finally, the new `ym` column is added to the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,177],"elapsed":174.42006586,"_type":"aimessage"}]
