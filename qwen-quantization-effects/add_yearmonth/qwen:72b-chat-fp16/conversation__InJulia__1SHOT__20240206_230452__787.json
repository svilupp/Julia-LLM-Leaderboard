The year and month are then concatenated together into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function and the `lpad` function to ensure that the month is always represented by two digits.\nThe resulting strings are stored in a new column `ym` of the DataFrame using the `!` operator, which tells Julia to assign the result to a new column rather than trying to apply it element-wise to an existing column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,204],"elapsed":201.005442083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
