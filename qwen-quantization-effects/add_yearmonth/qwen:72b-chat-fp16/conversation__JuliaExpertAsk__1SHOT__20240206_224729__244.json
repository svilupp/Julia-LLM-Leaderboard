Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution for your problem:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[!, :ym] = string.(Year.(df[:dt])) .* lpad(string.(Month.(df[:dt])), 2, '0')\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`, which contains the year and month of the dates in `dt`. The `Year` and `Month` functions are used to extract the respective values from the date. These values are then converted to strings using the `string` function, and concatenated together with the `*` operator. Finally, the resulting string is padded with a leading zero if necessary using the `lpad` function.\nFor example, if `df[:dt]` contains the dates \"2021-03-05\" to \"2021-04-09\", then the new column `ym` will contain the values \"202103\" to \"202104\".\n\nsummary\n\nThe solution provided a function `add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)` that creates a new column `ym` in a DataFrame `df`, which contains the year and month of the dates in `dt`. The function uses the `Year` and `Month` functions to extract the respective values from the date, converts them to strings using the `string` function, concatenates them together with the `*` operator, and pads the resulting string with a leading zero if necessary using the `lpad` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":328.594895941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
