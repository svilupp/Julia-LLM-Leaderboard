The format string `\"y\"` gives the year part of a Date and `\"m\"` gives the month part. The `* 100` operation is used to shift months by 2 digits to the left (e.g., 5 -> 05), and the `+` operator is then used to combine these two parts into a single integer.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym` that contains the year and month of each date in string format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,308],"elapsed":2.981044266,"_type":"aimessage"}]
