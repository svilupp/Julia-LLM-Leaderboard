Then it uses the `year` and `month` functions from the Dates module to extract the year and month from each DateTime. The `lpad` function is used to ensure that the month is always two digits (with leading zeros if necessary). Finally, the resulting string is parsed into an integer using the `parse` function.\n\nThis solution assumes that the DataFrame has been created with the DataFrames package and that the DateTime types have been imported from the Dates module.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":2.394180032,"_type":"aimessage"}]
