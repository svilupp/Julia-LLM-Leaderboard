The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (.) in the regex to match all characters, including newline characters.\n\nYou can test this function with your data like so:\n\n```python\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":2.092001816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
