Then it iterates over each line in this array. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and appends the rest of the line after the `# Question` marker to `question`, stripping leading spaces. Similarly for the Answer section. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.445393593,"_type":"aimessage"}]
