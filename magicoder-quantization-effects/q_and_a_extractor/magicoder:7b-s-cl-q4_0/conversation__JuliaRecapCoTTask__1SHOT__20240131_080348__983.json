[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using regular expressions to extract the sections:\n\n```julia\nusing README\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for (i, line) in enumerate(split(md, '\\n'))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = join(line[13:end], \" \")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = join(line[10:end], \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the markdown text into lines and iterates over them. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `question` to the rest of the line. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `answer` to the rest of the line. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each section (Question and Answer) is on its own line, which seems to be a reasonable assumption based on typical markdown syntax. If this is not always the case, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":2.16323214,"_type":"aimessage"}]
