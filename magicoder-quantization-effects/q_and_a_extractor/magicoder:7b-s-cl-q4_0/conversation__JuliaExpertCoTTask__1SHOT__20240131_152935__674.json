Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    section = nothing\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            section = :question\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            section = :answer\n        elseif section == :question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= line[7:end]\n        elseif section == :answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= line[8:end]\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it switches to the :question section, and if it starts with \"# Answer\", it switches to the :answer section. For any other lines, if they are not empty and we're currently in the question or answer sections, they get added to the respective string (after removing the leading spaces).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":2.368987623,"_type":"aimessage"}]
