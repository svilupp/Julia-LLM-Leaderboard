Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement this in Julia. Note that we are using the Statistics package for calculating the mean and extrema of the data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if average > max_temp\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif average < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If the list isn't empty, it calculates the average and extrema of the data using the `mean` and `extrema` functions from the Statistics package. It then determines the trend based on whether the average is greater than or less than the maximum or minimum temperature respectively. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.920063877,"_type":"aimessage"}]
