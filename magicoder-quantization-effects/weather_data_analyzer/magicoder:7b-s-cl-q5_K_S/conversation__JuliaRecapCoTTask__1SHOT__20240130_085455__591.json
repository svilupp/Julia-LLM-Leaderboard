[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Here's a possible implementation of your function:\n\nFirstly, make sure you have Statistics installed in your environment by running `] add Statistics`. If it is not installed, you should install it using the Julia Package Manager (Pkg).\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)::NamedTuple\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend_symbol = ifelse(maxTemp > minTemp, :increasing, \n                           ifelse(maxTemp < minTemp, :decreasing, :stable))\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend_symbol)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list of temperatures `temps` is empty. If it is, we immediately return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nNext, we calculate the average (mean), maximum and minimum temperature using the functions `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` from the Statistics package respectively.\n\nThen, we determine the trend of the data based on whether the maxTemp is greater than minTemp, or if they're equal (`:stable`), and set it to `:increasing` or `:decreasing`.\n\nFinally, we return a named tuple containing all calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.359487951,"_type":"aimessage"}]
