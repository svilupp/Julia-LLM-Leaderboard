Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResult <: NamedTuple\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend_value = 0.0\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend_value = (temps[2] - temps[1]) / temps[1]\n    end\n\n    if trend_value < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif trend_value == 0.0\n        trend = :stable\n    else\n        trend = :increasing\n    end\n\n    return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average temperature and the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package. It then determines if there's an overall trend in the data by calculating the difference between successive elements divided by the first element, and setting the trend symbol based on this value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.445855424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
