[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function in Julia programming language:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\nHere, the function `keep_only_names` takes in an array of strings (`words`). The array comprehension is used to generate a new array that includes only the words from the input list that start with a capital letter.\n\nThe `first(word)` gets the first character of each word and `uppercase(first(word))` returns it in upper case. This condition checks whether the first character of a word is an uppercase letter or not. \n\nNote: The function uses built-in functions like `first`, `uppercase` from Base package, and list comprehension (`[word for ...]`) which are standard features in Julia programming language.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":1.755930953,"_type":"aimessage"}]
