Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    df[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to select only rows in which both manufacturer is `\"audi\"` and model is either `\"a4\"` or `\"a4 quattro\"`. It then creates a new column called `:audi_a4_type`, setting all of its values to `true`. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":1.248020554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
