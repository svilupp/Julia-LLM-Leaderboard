[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks and join them together with newline\n    return replace(md, r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s => \"\\$1\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find all instances of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. The `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s` pattern matches any string that starts with \"```julia\\n\", followed by any number of characters (`.*?`), and ends with \"\\n```\". This is then replaced with the captured group, which is the actual Julia code. The result is a single string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks, each separated by a newline.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown document uses standard fenced code block syntax for Julia code. If it uses different syntax or has other special requirements, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":1.74471978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
