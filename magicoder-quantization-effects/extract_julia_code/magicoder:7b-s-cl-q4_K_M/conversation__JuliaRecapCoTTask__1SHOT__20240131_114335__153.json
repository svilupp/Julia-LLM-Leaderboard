[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can solve this problem using Python's `re` module to extract the code blocks from the markdown document:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = re.findall(r'```julia(.+?)```', md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return '\\n'.join(matches)\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find all occurrences of ```julia...``` in the markdown document and captures everything inside these fences. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match any character, including a newline.\n\nIf you want to use this function with Julia instead of Python, you can do so by using Julia's `Regex` type:\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia(.+?)```\", md))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join([match[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function does essentially the same thing as the Python version, but it uses Julia's `RegularExpressions` module to find all occurrences of ```julia...``` in the markdown document and captures everything inside these fences.","status":200,"tokens":[87,352],"elapsed":2.921503517,"_type":"aimessage"}]
