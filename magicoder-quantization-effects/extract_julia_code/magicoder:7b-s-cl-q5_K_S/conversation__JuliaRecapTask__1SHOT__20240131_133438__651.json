[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all Julia code from markdown document:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks\n    matches = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of code blocks marked by ```julia and ```. It collects all these matches into an array `matches` and then uses a list comprehension to extract the actual code. The `join` function is used to concatenate all the matched strings with newline characters in between, resulting in one long string containing all the Julia code.\n\nNote: This assumes that there are no other backticks (`\\``) or tildes (`~`) in the markdown document. If there could be, you would need a more complex regular expression to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.205372741,"_type":"aimessage"}]
