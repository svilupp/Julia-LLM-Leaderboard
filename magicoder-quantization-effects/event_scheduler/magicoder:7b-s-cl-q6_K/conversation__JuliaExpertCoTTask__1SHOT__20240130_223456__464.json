Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If such a conflict is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input list `events` is sorted by start times. If this assumption does not hold, you may need to sort the list before running the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":2.811833622,"_type":"aimessage"}]
