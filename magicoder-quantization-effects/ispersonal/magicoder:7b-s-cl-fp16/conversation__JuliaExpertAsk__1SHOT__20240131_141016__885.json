All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Bus}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{Truck}) = false\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false # default value for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # prints: true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # prints: false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # prints: false\n```\nIn the code above, we define a type hierarchy with `AbstractVehicle` as an abstract supertype and `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are subtypes. We then define a function `ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T <: AbstractVehicle` that returns whether the given type is personal or not. The function uses pattern matching to match against different types, returning true if it matches any of the specific types and false otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[142,326],"elapsed":5.672016856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
