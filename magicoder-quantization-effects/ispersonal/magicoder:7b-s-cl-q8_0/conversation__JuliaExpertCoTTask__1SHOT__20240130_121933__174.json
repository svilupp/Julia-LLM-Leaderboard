All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function `ispersonal` takes an argument `vehicle`, and uses the built-in function `typeof` to determine the type of the argument at runtime. \n\nIf the argument is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, the function returns true. If it's a `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns false. Otherwise, if the argument doesn't match any of these cases, it defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[0,309],"elapsed":3.523818749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
