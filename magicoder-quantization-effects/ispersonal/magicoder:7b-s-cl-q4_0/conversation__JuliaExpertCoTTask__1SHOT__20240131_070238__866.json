We then define the function `ispersonal` that takes a vehicle of any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as input.\n\nInside this function, we use Julia's `isa` operator to check if the given vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and return true in such cases. If it is not one of these types, but is an instance of either `Bus` or `Truck`, we return false.\n\nIf the vehicle is neither a car nor a motorcycle, but is still a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we default to returning false by using the else clause.","status":200,"tokens":[260,318],"elapsed":6.906536729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
