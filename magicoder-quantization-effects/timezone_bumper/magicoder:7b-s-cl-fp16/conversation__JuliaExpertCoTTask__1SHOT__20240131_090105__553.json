It first checks if the provided input is indeed a `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the specified number of hours to the DateTime object and returns the result.\n\nYou can use this function with your example like so:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,194],"elapsed":3.354125492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
